0,We should all think about how fucked up this is when the NHS thinks it's better for men to get life threatening cancer than supply a vaccine because of cost considerations.

--------------------------

>SIDE EFFECTS
>Overall Summary Of Adverse Reactions

>Headache, fever, nausea, and dizziness; and local injection site reactions (pain, swelling, erythema, pruritus, and bruising) occurred after administration with GARDASIL.

>Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL and may result in falling with injury; observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. [See WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]

>Anaphylaxis has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL.

BTW: The vaccine only protects against 9 strains of hpv. There are more than 100 strains of hpv."

5,"C'mon guys, get real. 

The first paragraph of this article says - ""MPs from every political party are lining up to support The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to vaccinate teenage boys against the cancer-causing virus HPV.""

From 3rd paragraph - ""But it also causes thousands of cases of other cancers every year among men, affecting areas including the head and throat, and often decades after they were infected.""

Sounds like it has only recently come to light that HPV also effects men as well. 

I'm with MGTOW 100%, but there are plenty of examples where men are fucked over that AREN'T improving to waste time bitching about things that are being fixed."
6,Did someone in that article really fucking say they would prefer boys get cancer in the future than lose some money? 
7,That's cool. I'll stop fucking then. No diseases for me.

9,"I think a lot of the time things like this are a result of the ""squeaky wheel gets the grease"" principal. It's often not that no one cares about men; it's that women make every little thing an issue and so they get the lion's share of the attention/resources. 

Of course there is the ""women are wonderful"" bias at play in society so maybe I am full of shit, I dunno. "

13,Facts bro

15,"> The vaccine only protects against 9 strains of hpv

Better than nothing. 
"
16,"this better not be anti-vax stuff, all vaccinations have a side effect risk, some slightly more than others, the side effect risk of released vaccines has been deemed at a low enough level that the protection granted by the vaccine is significantly more beneficial than the minor chance of exhibiting a side effect (there's a bunch of math and statistics that go into this both financial and non-financial)"
17,Let the girls deal with the side effects. As long as they are vaccinated the guys won't get it
18,"Yeah, was gonna post, I think hpv vax was kind of a money grab scam, so I'm not trying to promote it to men (unless they want it for whatever reason)

19,I really think there has to be something perverse in how Anglo societies think thats driving this. It cant be a coincidence that 4 out of the top 5 or 6 most fucked up societies worldwide when it comes to feminism are all either Britain or former British colonies
20,You mean female politicians and leaders like there are in Europe? Um look at its current state now lol... it’s going to shit in general. 
21,"Are you being sarcastic? They knew it affected men a long time ago.

10 years ago I had a professor who worked for the CDC tell the entire class that they should probably give the vaccine to boys because it can cause cancer regardless of sex, but it was easier to give it to girls because they spread it the most."
22,"""Ending the ‘vaccine apartheid’ would cost about £22 million a year. But until now, the NHS’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has argued this would not be ‘cost-effective’, claiming it is cheaper to treat the horrifying cancers caused by HPV.""

23,No. Women spread it much faster than men. It's to save money on vaccines. And it's also because nobody gives a shit about young men.

25,"I'm not a gambling man. My issue with this is how people go around saying vaccines are **safe** and **effective**.

* Safe - free from harm or risk 

Vaccines can't be safe if there is a risk. That's more double speak.

I also have an issue with people that try to force others to take the vaccine. If you and your family took the vaccine it means you guys are protected. So the fact that some else did not take the vaccine does not effect you or your family. Because you guys are protected by the vaccine right? The reason someone else not being vaccinated would be an issue is if the vaccine does not work. And if the vaccine does not work why did you get vaccinated for.

Also the vaccine effectiveness is also questionable.

29,"The way he talked about it made it seem like boys would be getting the vaccine in a couple of years.

But people just don't give a shit about young men. Women are always first."
30,"Considering there are 100s of strains of HPV and the vaccines only deal with a handful, its obvious the point of the vaccine is not to actually protect anyone, although its billed to silly women as the magic bullet.  Either the point is to actually infect these women and make them carriers precisely to give the virus to men (ok, maybe not that likely the motive) OR to convince women they're invincible now so they'll be sluts and not think about the consequences (ding ding ding, we have a winner)."
31,"Vaccines are reasonably safe.
I am not a expert in this, but vaccines are only as strong as your immune system.
We get vaccines to protect the young and elderly from potentially deadly diseases and other people who are immunocompromised who cannot get a vaccine (or at least wouldn't be effective). Everything has a ""risk"" a meteor could hit you right now, it could hit me right now, maybe something that's never been seen before will pop up and destroy us all instantly, maybe the first cancer cell is appearing in me/you/anyone, maybe a massive gamma ray burst is heading for us right now :) all those happy things that could happen to us at any moment

Also hi mgtow peoples."
32,YOU DIRTY ABLEIST!!
33,"Dude its just a vaccine. Demand creates supply. If it was so necessary they would add it to the list of vaccines and some company would pick up manufacturing.

Edit : My point being cost is usually a non-factor if the need was indicated other ways would have come up. But instead they decided that the cost to treat the cases in a few would be much less than giving vaccines to everyone."
34,"As far as I can tell from reputable sources the strains the vaccines protect against cover the majority of cancer cases.

I'm sure they're not perfect, but all the evidence suggests you're better of being vaccinated than not.

The prescribing data for Gardasil 9 at least says that it is non-infectious and made from recombinant capsid protein.  I can't imagine how somebody could become a disease carrier if the vaccine doesn't even contain viral DNA.

Even if you're a conspiracy theorist I don't really see the point in elaborating a complex and expensive fake public health campaign just to infect people with a virus that is already extremely common.  People were spreading the dangerous strains of HPV long before the vaccines came out.

It certainly should be made available to men who are at a low risk of having had multiple sexual partners.  I doubt it would do much good for anybody who has been generally sexually active, since they're probably already carrying the virus."
35,It's just cancer.
36,"The need wasn't indicated because men are expendable.


That's why men go to prison, it's why men don't get diagnosed, it's why men stay homeless. No need is indicated when it's a man, but when it's a woman we throw every penny at it.

* Safe - free from harm or risk 

How can vaccines be **safe** If there is a risk?

"
38,The vaccine doesn't infect them with HPV.
39,"How can a definition be useful if it is taken to such an absolute that it doesn't apply to anything that actually exists?  Everything you do or don't do entails SOME level of risk.

Most nations regulate vaccines on the basis of the relationship between their benefits and risks.  They tend to be pretty conservative with vaccines since they're generally taken by very large numbers of people who are healthy."
40,Things can be simultaneously safe and risky. It's not a contradiction. What matters is the level of risk and with vaccines it's very low. 
41,"Hate to be the one to point out how retarded you are but a vaccine is literally a weakened form of a virus strain being introduced into your body to train your immune system to recognize it and fight it. The potential risk of every vaccine is failure to immunize and getting infected with the full blown virus anyway. Dear fucking god how do you not know this?
"
42,"While i agree with you that a lot of thing are general safe to imply vaccines are safe is misleading and is meant to decieve people.
If there is a risk to something then people should be aware of the
risks and those people can determine for themselves if the risks
out weighs the benefits. People should not be forced into taking
something that may harm them just because other people
are okay with taking that risk."
43,"Not every vaccine contains an active virus. Anybody can look that up on Wikipedia, but I went to college."
44,"While I agree that for most things it is up to the individual to weigh the risks/benefits, I do think that vaccinations should be compulsory in most cases.  The problem is that you're not only putting your own health at risk when you choose not to vaccinate.  The exceptions would be if the vaccine isn't indicated except for small populations, or if the vaccine is contra-indicated due to an allergy or other health concern for the recipient.  I would not allow exemptions for religious or personal beliefs."
45,You went to college but do not know that vaccines have viruses in them. Talk about pissing tuition money down the drain on a low IQ dipshit.
46,"> The problem is that you're not only putting your own health at risk when you choose not to vaccinate.

That's not true. If the vaccine protects you. You are protected. If i don't take the vaccine i'm the one not protected. The only way you would be affect by me not being vaccinated is if the vaccine does not work. And if the vaccine does not work what is the point in getting vaccinated?"
47,"I know you're a troll, but this is funny to me.

Types of vaccines:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine#Types

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardasil#Ingredients
>Major capsid protein L1 of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18

That's not a virus. It's a protein that can't replicate.

Calling me retarded and repeating incorrect information doesn't make you right."
48,"Vaccines are not 100% effective.  This is why it is important that everybody be vaccinated.  If somebody who is one of the lucky 1% that didn't get an effective dose they're still safe if everybody around them is vaccinated, since the odds are very low that enough people with ineffective vaccinations would come into contact and spread the disease.

There are also individuals who cannot be vaccinated due to allergies or other health concerns.  They don't get a choice in the matter, so they're only safe if everybody else is vaccinated.

A vaccine doesn't need to be 100% effective to be tremendously beneficial.  No vaccine is 100% effective, and yet polio and smallpox are completely eradicated in the first world.  I wouldn't say that those vaccines were not worth it even if they weren't 100% effective at the individual level."
49,">In 1977, Dr. Jonas Salk (inventor of the Salk polio vaccine) testified along with other scientists that most (87%) of the polio cases which have occurred in the U.S. since the early 1970's were the by-product of the polio vaccine itself. Note: The Sabin oral polio vaccine (OPV) is the only known cause of polio in the U.S. today,--Centers for Disease Control (CDC) statistics.

>Science 86, the publication of the prestigious American Association for the Advancement of Science: ""European countries have eradicated polio without vaccinating everyone, Finland, for example, seemed to have wiped out polio when only a fraction of its population had been vaccinated.""

http://www.gval.com/facts.htm"
50,"Sure, and if a disease can be eradicated without the need to vaccinate everybody I'm fine with that, though that is probably fairly situational.  To the degree that eradication is impractical then vaccinating everybody would be the next best thing.

I'm all for achieving the greatest health impact with the minimal invasiveness.  However, this should be at the judgement of people like Salk, and not your average anti-vaxer..."
51,"[CDC: HPV-Associated Oropharyngeal Cancer Rates by Race and Ethnicity](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/headneck.htm)

53,"This is just coming out? I got the vaccine a few years back, and was given the impression it was useful regardless of gender

Edit: The consensus seems to be that it was heavily marketed to girls but still available for boys, although a lot of boys never received it"

56,"This has been the standard of care for years now in the US and many Canadian provinces. There are several benefits to immunizing boys:

1. The obvious benefit is protecting boys from penile/anal/laryngeal cancer.
2. Immunized boys also won't spread HPV to female/male sexual partners.
3. Herd immunity kicks in if at least 80% of the population is immunized, so even non-immunized people get the benefit.
4. Gay men are not often thought of when it comes to immunizations, but they clearly benefit as well.

The HPV vaccine is PROVEN SAFE. We have over 10 years of drug trial and postmarket data on it from multiple countries, and side effects are rare and benign. Anaphylaxis is exceedingly rare and on par with the rate of other vaccines.

It is also VERY EFFECTIVE. When properly used, Gardasil-9 offers 98-99% immunity against the covered strains.

Currently the Gardasil-9 protects against 9 oncogenic strains. It's the best vaccine we have. Recommended age starts at 9. Yes, immunize your kids way before they start having sex. By the age of 9 you should be telling them about sex.

We are also trialing 1 and 2-sequence immunization and so far the data looks good. It may be just as good as the 3-sequence. Another avenue of current research is extending the window to the late 20's. Also promising data.

A Scandinavian mathematical model created by researchers showed that HPV incidence could be vastly reduced after just 10 years of following the current recommendations, and eradicated within 20 years. This is huge. This is literally eliminating cancer the way we did with polio.

The research community agrees that boys need to be vaccinated. All the guidlines I studied say so. The clinicians (MDs, PAs, NPs), however, remain somewhat divided. Pediatricians recommend the vaccine most consistently, while Family Medicine is less likely to do so. There are several reasons for this:

1. Many providers simply don't see the benefit of immunization justifying the cost. This is a personal belief that truly flies in the face of the evidence.
2. Providers feel uncomfortable discussing sex with patients and their families at the age of 9, and they end up avoiding the topic altogether - perhaps until 13-15, by the time many patients are sexually active. Again, a personal problem.
3. Vaccine stocking costs are high. Offices have to buy the vaccines in bulk and pay for them at the time of purchase, and hope that enough patients want the vaccine to recoup costs. Acquisition and storage costs are considerable. Some just decide not to stock the vaccine at all.
4. Reimbursement rates are not good. Paying full price for the vaccine up front and hoping that insurance pays more than it cost is a major deterrent for offices against stocking the vaccine.
5. Federal vaccine reimbursement programs (VFC - Vaccines for Children) helps pay offices for the cost of vaccines, but not all offices are eligible to participate.
6. Providers are not assertive enough. Many ask parents, ""I can give the HPV vaccine today. Would you like to get it?"" This is just not a strong enough recommendation. They should be saying, ""the HPV vaccine is due today. We are going to get it for you"" (and see if the parents oppose). I think this relates to #1 and #2.
7. Providers see the vaccine as optional, rather than recommended (similar to #6). It can be bundled with other vaccines due at the same time and given safely.
8. School vaccination requirements often don't include Gardasil, so families and providers don't focus on it.
9. The vaccine is expensive. Without insurance, it costs $200-300 for patients. This is a huge reason they opt not to immunize their children.
All research shows that a strong provider recommendation is the BIGGEST reason parents decide to vaccinate their children. It is a more powerful reason than even parents' own personal beliefs are regarding immunization. If providers make a strong recommendation, parents are much more likely to decide to vaccinate.

Edit: I got some upvotes (thank you!) and expanded my post, again. Added content from a child post down there concerning the reasons healthcare providers don't vaccinate boys. These reasons, again, come from the research I did for my thesis and are unfortunately found in many practices."

And they asked me after the first and second ones if I wanted to keep going. 

My aunt had cervical cancer as a result of contracting HPV in the 80s. She was never able to have kids and still has medical issues to this day. So after the first and second ones I said I wanted to keep going, because not being able to have a kid was worse than the side-effects of the vaccine. Dying from cancer was worse than puking a few times. 

Please vaccinate your kids. "
128,"I (M, 25yo) actually participated to a clinical study a few years back where i got a new HPV vaccine administrated, which in my country, Belgium, is also only reimbursed for young women. The goal was to quantify the antibody concentration the new vaccine would cause. So now I am immune against the most common strains as well as 200 euros richer. #blessed"
129,I believe (this was 11 years ago now - 2007) it was actually required of me as a college student to get this vaccination before attending and living on campus. This was a private college in New York state.
130,I’m actually getting my second shot for it soon so cool.
131,I got it like 5 years ago before I went off to college.
132,I'm a guy and I got the series of vaccines when I was young. Isn't it just a normal thing like a chicken pox vaccine?
133,this is weird i just got the last round of my hpv vaccine this morning
134,Dudes we don’t even tolerate public breastfeeding in the US.  You think parents are going to allow their kids to be vaccinated against an STI?  Backwards ass country.  
135,I actually got the HPV shot a couple of weeks ago. My primary recommended it to me. So I got it. 
136,I got this vaccine a year ago after my Dad got cancer and we learned that HPV can cause cancer. (Not that his cancer was caused by HPV).  Cosco offers them for cheaper than I could get through my insurance and you don't need a prescription to get them there. I'd reccomend it.
137,"I never wanted to be tested for HPV because I heard they had to swab up inside your urethra with a cuetip.  Well, I finally decided to do it and it was not nearly as painful, uncomfortable, or awkward as I expected.  My advice to guys out there is to just go do it.   Always better to know what's going on with your body."
138,"This seems like a very big ""Aaaaahhh Duuuuuuh"" moment"
139,"Imagine the terrible feeling a man would have  watching his wife dying from cervical cancer he gave her. 

Now imagine that's your son and the woman is the mother of your grandchildren. 

Give your son his shots."
140,I mean I got mine and I fell good
141,21 year old male. Just recently got my first HPV vaccine shot (out of 3). Genital warts doesn't give a fuck about gender
142,"Had stage 4 head and neck cancer from HPV exposure. -1 of 10, would **DEFINITELY** not recommend. Get the shots. Get them for your kids. Trust me."
143,"I've been saying this for years. How could we better protect our girls from cervical cancer than through herd immunity. This whole ""vaccinate half the population"" is ridiculous when there's no resource shortage."
144,Case in point: women should not be the only ones responsible for maintaining safe sex practices. 
145,"Good news everyone   
[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44939379](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44939379)"
146,"I remember saying this in front of my undergrad class in 2012, everyone just laughed at me. I'm like..... one, not treating the men as well as the women is like treating patients who have malaria and doing nothing about he mosquitos. Men are reservoirs and vectors for HPV. Two. Its very likely it affects men too, HPV is dangerous in regions where there is transitional tissue, there are regions in the human body where this occurs.....other than the cervix, including the anus and the throat. But i legit got laughed at when I brought it up."
147,"I'm no anti vaxxer, but why should I, a male, get an ovary cancer vaccine?

(article requires account so I didn't read all, I'm pretty sure it an ovary cancer herpes thing)

Edit: Thanks, i now know that it's an STD that COULD cause cancer, not some ovary cancer thing. You've changed my world view. I might vaccine myself"
148,"I will say that this vaccine has probably saved my life already. Long story short, fooled around with a guy in friendship group who, come to find out, was also fooling around with like 3 or 4 other girls. Couple years after high school, get a call from one of said friends to hangout. Get to her place and she's got the other mentioned ladies all there to tell me they all have HPV from the guy and I should be tested. One girl already had cervical cancer from it. I went home and cooked my mom a huge cake as thank you for forcing me to get those shots. "
149,To my understanding in finland they give hpv vaccines to boys already.
150,"I regret not getting this vaccine when I could. For some reason, it was never pushed upon me by my medical provider, and I think I also was wary because it it involved a series of shots. I'm 28 now (just too late) so get it while you can, men."
151,"I’m shocked to hear that this wasn’t the common practice. I received the HPV vaccine series when I turned 12 and I thought everyone did, not just girls! 

Anyways I’m happy to hear that boys will get the same protection now and hope that it will soon be just as available to young men. "
152,"About time, if you're in the UK take a look at Dr. Peter Baker at HPVaction.org , I met him in a sexual health clinic and the man is amazing, he's been pushing for this for years. Nice to see a dedicated bloke and his peers finally having some recognition.

Edit: if this vaccine was already in place I wouldn't have had to go to multiple doctors, it's a shame that it's even a point to contest."
153,"10 years ago my college gf at the time got this and I remember asking the doctor if I should too and she just laughed and walked out of the room. I then asked a nurse why it was important that she got it but not for me since I could spread it to people and she told me, and I quote, ""that's not how this works"". I mean, I was 17 at the time but it made sense to me that this is exactly how it worked. Ha"
154,"I always wondered why girls got it but boys didn't. I think we were told it's a gender specific illness but that didn't make sense to me because I've never heard of something like that. I guess this is kind of the same as breast cancer, even though all forms of cancer exist and they happen to all genders, somehow breast cancer seems to be more important. They're all bad diseases but why should the victims of another receive better treatment, prevention and support than others?"
155,"So if you take this vaccine as a woman you're guaranteed to have a reduced prevalence of cervical cancer right?   I'm sure there's plenty of studies showing a direct reduction in occurrence of cervical cancer.

Oh wait now, turns out its just your typical play on Alpha values and leaps of faith based on the theory that ""HPV-rooted"" CIN is likely to become cancerous .   Yet after so many years Merck has been peddling this overly priced vaccine, they have yet to demonstrate actual efficacy that cancer in the populations they vaccinate is reduced.   Yet they they're pillaging the public in healthcare costs and spending money on marketing instead of science.

Was expecting a debate of the efficacy of this product in /r/science; yet nothing of the sort.    The complete lack actual discussion of the science behind this vaccine and method seems to be way over everyone's head.     We should be holding our public officials to a higher standard, just because Merck sends them on an all-expenses paid trip to sell them on the ""**science**"" doesn't mean the public at large should be gullible enough to buy it.

I don't even want to see the logical leap they made to try to double their sales by pushing this on boys as well.   Yet no genuine scientific scrutiny anywhere to be found in this group of responses.   No wonder the general population is just getting fatter, sicker, and losing its health-span.    We have idiots in charge of the healthcare system."
156,"This is incredibly obvious, and I can't believe it's taken us this long to come to this conclusion. The only argument against it is our undying cultural disgust of anything that has the potential to modulate sexual behavior from rigidly defined social law.

(I got the vaccine because my parents did the right thing and pushed my pediatrician for it even though it wasn't indicated for males. I feel bad for anyone who didn't have that sort of guidance)"
157,"Is there any company other than Merck that makes an hpv vaccine?

I'm always hearing stories expanding the use of HPV vaccines and having worked with Merck, it really makes me wonder how much if this expansion is just Merck trying to gild a Lily for profit."

His mum kept asking me how he got it...(because I'm a speech pathologist) didn't want to embarrass the poor guy. 

Use protection for oral people. "
162,"In Denmark the HPV vaccine is free for women, which is very good for women, but it almost hurts the vaccine, guys think the vaccine is only for women, it is not being targeted towards men, and therefore most of the guys i have told that i bought the vaccine (Gardasil 9) asked why i bought that, they thought it was for women ONLY!"
163,"There's multiple strains of HPV. If a patient has already contracted one of them, will the vaccine prevent them from contracting others?

I haven't had any luck when I google that question."
164,Can anyone get this? Or is it not as effective for older people (20+?)?
165,An ex unknowingly gave me HPV (supposedly since there wasn't a way to test men for it) a few years back and I've developed a swallowing disorder since then. Not sure if it's related but this disease is common and clearly underestimated in the US. 
166,"Hi, I'm a Canadian boy.

I had to get an HPV vaccine in school."
167,"It's super ironic that I opened Reddit to this thread because I'm sitting in the waiting room waiting to get my final shot (of the 3) right now. 

It was offered to me as a teen but my very conservative anti-vax mom flipped out and convinced me I'd drop dead if I went through with it. I'm 19 now and decided to go ahead. 

I'll update if I drop dead."
168,"Not just boys, but adults should also be given this vaccine. In my view this is one example of science being too slow for its own sake. The likelihood that an adult already has all strains of HPV present in the vaccine is very low. So if the vaccine could prevent an adult from acquiring 6,5,4,3,2 or 1 strains, that is still one less risk factor for cancer or genital warts."
169,"The article seems to have a paywall which is irritating, but I thought this was the standard.

Last time I had a GP well visit (years back) I was offered it, but my parents declined."
170,"I asked my doctor before I reached the age limit if I can get the vaccine. Dude said he thinks it’s only for women then proceeded to talk about stocks.

I’m like wtf dude. You’re a doctor and your checking an outdated material"
171,"Considering how prevelant HPV is I don't see why everyone shouldn't be vaccinated. One of the biggest frustrations (in the US) is that a lot of insurance companies will just not cover this vaccine because the CDC has been so slow to reccomended it for boys and adults they seem to write off entirely.

I will happily be corrected if there is another reason to intentionally not vaccinate adults but the only rational I've seen is just assuming they are already infected regardless of if the person has ever had sex which seems a bit un-scientific and discriminatory. If you don't already have HPV you should be allowed to get the vaccine and have it covered imo. (readers from countries with free healthcare feel free to ignore this US-specific complaint of mine)"
172,"I got it for my son. Three injections, 700 bucks each. Totally worth it."
173,"This gossip girl at my work has been telling everyone NOT to give the HPV vac to their kids. I'm not sure the reason why....when she begins speaking, I put my ear buds in."
174,I worked as a medical representative a few years ago when Gardasil was released on the market - most of the GPs I visited were vaccinating their own sons as well as daughters. 
175,"My mom won't allow me to get one because she says it  has a chance of paralyzing me but she's dead wrong and when I try to explain it to her, she denies it. Rip me"

178,"This will probably be deleted. I have been permanently injured by this vaccine. Do research on the adverse reaction rate for this vaccine. It’s terrible, especially if you test positive for the MTHFR gene mutation. I urge everyone to dig deep into this one.  "
179,"Do your research on this shot(s)  before jumping on board. Lots of side effects. Many young people sick, some have lost their hair, some have died.  Do your research.   Lots of auto immune issues tied to this shot. "
180,"Funny. Merck launches a big ad campaign for their HPV virus, and voila there’s “research” imploring people to get said vaccine. "
181,How related are different strains of HPV? Would the vaccine prevent other types of warts? Like plantar warts?
182,Why specifically boys? I thought this was a vaccine everyone needed
183,"It's now given to teenage boys and girls in Ontario as part of the regular vaccine schedule. (They get the shots at the same time as Hep B and Meningitis shots) Girls have been getting it for years, but boys only just started last year."
184,hasn't then been happening for a couple years now?
185,The military did this while I was active duty. I thought it was normal procedure. 
186,Yea I Actualy got this shot last year(17 year old male) for this very reason

Though a girl I slept with has HPV, I probably already have a strain, but there is no way to test for a guy "
197,My doctor made me get this before my freshman year at college.
198,how is this just news now. having to get the bumps in your throat checked out is super not fun.
199,"I remember when I told my mother I was getting one she went on a long rant about how I just needed condoms, happy about getting it now"
200,What are arguments against giving the vaccine?
201,Don't be embarrassed to take this vaccine if you are older than the recommended age. Get the 3 shots over with and live with peace.
202,I got the vaccine last year! Totally recommend getting it if you have not already.

Is there any validity to his concerns that not enough is known about the vaccine or is he off base? Our child is still too young for it but is up to date on all other vaccinations. "
207,I got them just last year the protection of it is great but the shots hurt like hell when you get them
208,"I got it without the recommendation, I asked my doctor and he was like ok that's good. Cost me $200 for all 3 shots because Alberta health care only covers females."
209,I remember this one. My ex gf (who is from the EU) had to pay for it out of pocket because it wasn't covered by standard mandatory insurance or other govt health care. And because she and I didn't have the money and her parents had read disinformation about it on the internet they didn't want to pay for it either. 
210,"I took this vaccine because my mom insisted (she’s a nurse), very glad I did. "

216,"For a second I thought it said ""Women should be given birth control says everyone smart.""

Then I realized this is the bad universe. "
217,Of course they should. Wasn’t this already known before?
218,If I have it and my other half had the vacination could she still contract it?

228,"I think I took this vaccine several years ago.  It may have been early as I was in middle school 10 years ago, I just remember being taken to the doctor for a vaccination and being told that one of them was mainly for girls but still recommended for boys."
229,And girls shouldn't be given mandatory one as well because? 
230,"I was given the full course of the vaccine (I'm a dude) by my regular doctor at the same time that I got my flu shot. Is it not standard to give this vaccine to guys?

Even if it doesn't affect men's bodies at all, it's smart to prevent someone from being a carrier, and transmitting it to their partner(s) right? "
231,Im a guy and I am getting the last shot in a few days.  I was under the impression that everyone got it.  I know it was made to prevent (ovary?) Cancer in girls.
232,"I actually tried to get this vaccine a few months back in college, but the physicians there were very discouraging of it since I am a heterosexual male. "
233,"As a male I’d have appreciated getting this vaccine in school, I had 6 months of wart hell."
234,Well that's certainly a step in the right direction.
235,28 y/o Welshman here. Is this something that can be done under the NHS?? 
236,I got it! The whole time me and my brother and dad were making jokes about how this was making us ready for cunnilingus. 
237,"Yeah, I thought this was already a thing. Got those at least 5 years ago"
238,"When this vaccine first came out, insurance did not pay for it. I priced it then at $3000. "
239,"In the UK this is now going to be given out to 12-/13-year-olds. Is there any way of young adults getting it on the NHS, too? Say, a 21-year-old?"
240,"So I have had throat symptoms of HPV for nearly a year. I was with a women who had a rare strain cmr 141 but cleared the virus on her own and had clean Pap smears for years. Anyone know if I would benefit from the vaccine since I’m probably a carrier already. I’m worried that by getting the vaccine, it would make my symptoms worse. From reading the article, it sounds like nearly all the cancers they studied were caused by the 2-3 stains already covered by the vaccine. "
241,"Sounds like this isn't a decision of safety, but a money one. It's been known safe for a decade. I'm surprised, though, that it took until now to be considered worth the money for everyone. HPV can cause anal cancer, and everyone has an anus, and I would think one instance of cancer would out-cost countless vaccines. Considering herd immunity and just the badness of HPV on its own, it seems obvious. But I'm glad it's happening. My mom pushed me hard to get it in like 2009, despite my lack of cervix. I rolled my eyes at the time, cuz I couldn't imagine a world where I had sex. I'm glad to say it seems worthwhile now 😏"
242,"I paid for mine in Canada (3 shots, $200 each) as I felt it was worth it and I was past the age it was free when I learned about it. I sell outdoor gear and the way I looked at it: people will spend $600 or more to be waterproof. I'll happily pay that to be somewhat genital wart proof!"
243,I definitely got mine quite a few years back
244,I'm male and I'm vaccinated for it. Granted it was just an extra needle they jammed in my arm when I joined the military.
245,"Male UK student here - all of the girls got a shot recently, but none of the guys did. Really annoying to know that it would help boys - the reasoning behind not giving it to the boys was mostly that it wouldn't help."
246,"umm - boys have sex (or will) - boys transit HPV. Was there anything else that needed to be said to justify vaccinating?

Strange how everyone is so into herd immunity and how folks have to, have to, get vaccinated- unless the folks primarily impacted are women."
247,"I wish I would've had that vaccine, everyone I know that's had it doesn't get cold sores. IDK if it's related but that sure would be nice. I discovered that chewing tobacco makes them go away almost instantly for me, so basically I can either have herpes on my lip or mouth cancer. Fml"
248,"great! 

i tried to get it last year because i suspected that i might have (and i did) HPV and the nurse at the clinic wanted me to leave because ""guys can't get HPV."" a few doctor's visits later, it turned out that i had gotten a potentially dangerous HPV-related skin condition. never going to that clinic again."

254,Is it worth getting if your older or no?

256,I got it a few years ago. If I recall correctly it was required for me to go to college?
257,"how behind are we that this is now -- only now --  being promoted?   Horrifying,   no wonder our country is so messed up healthwise"
258,"where im from, its pretty much mandatory for girls (parents can opt out, but it rarely happens) and boys can opt in."
259,">The UK government is considering whether to extend the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination programme to boys after an expert committee found that it was cost effective.

Is that the best reason?"
260,"Just got mine today, conveniently "
261,"I remember asking about this as a 20-something female when it first came out and was told it probably wouldn't help me since I was probably already exposed since I was sexually active. :\\ They definitely prioritized teen girls first, then women, then boys, if I remember correctly. At least that's how the timeline of the ads seemed to develop."
262,"Is there a steadfast rule on boys getting it by a certain age? I'm older, married and monogomous, but I would still like to get it."
263,"I got it after the doctor told my brother that if he didn’t get it, he would get warts on his wiener and the nurse would have to come hold it while the doctor freezes the warts off. Not sure if that’s true but it doesn’t really matter"
264,"Yeah. It’s not demanded. I’m about to enter my freshman year of college and while most mainstream vaccines are required, HPV wasn’t (I still got it though, and other colleges might require). My doctor still highly recommended it to me, so while the government doesn’t necessitate it, from what I’ve gathered most doctors recommend it to their patients."
265,"My son (youngish teenager now) got it a couple years ago. I wanted him to have it just as much as I wanted it for my 3 daughters. Pediatrician recommended it, insurance covered it, bob's your uncle--he's immunized. (I'm in UT, btw.) "
266,"In Alberta, they started giving the vaccine to boues a few years ago"
267,It never made sense to me that the vaccine wasn’t recommended to both sexes equally. 
268,so why wasn’t it recommended to boys before?
269,Hm wild... I remember getting this back in 2013 to avoid being carrier regardless of it effecting me or not. 
270,"I was on a flight to Europe in 2015 and sitting next to me was the Director of Otolaryngology at Johns Hopkins.  We discussed the promising cancer research “cures” being publicized, but he said that throat cancer in the near term is a major problem and that the cases for males had a hockey stick growth profile and indicated parents were vaccinating their girls for HPV, but boys were being avoided.  To him, this was a major behavior pattern that had to be changed.   Looks like he was right.   "
271,"They decided this in my province in Canada about 8 years ago, but it isn't retroactive so the boys who didn't get the free vaccine would have to pay a whopping 700$ to get it."
272,I got extremely ill for roughly two weeks after I got my first round of Gardasil. Have any changes been made to the drug at all?
273,HPV causes life threatening cancers in both men and women. It makes logical sense and clinical sense to vaccinate both.
274,"I do social work with many gay male clients. The incidence of anal cancer has been higher than I expected, with every case I've heard of being a suspected result of HPV.

The vaccine seems to have merit for both genders, but I'm a medical guy. "
275,"I had no idea it existed. Why wouldn't you vaccinate women too?

I suppose I don't need to worry about it now that I'm married. "
276,"If only they said this 20 years ago. 



"
277,Can someone explain to me why this is recommended? I don’t really understand the ins and outs of the vaccine.
278,"Get your GD shots men and women while you are young enough!! I regret not getting the shot everyday, now my husband and I both have HPV #16 along with lots of other people."
279,French government recommended it for a while now. I got it. 
280,"You get in grade 7 in Canada, regardless of gender. It’s optional, but you’re kinda pushed to get it."
281,My mother in law got hpv from a man who did not know he could have it. This seems like a no brainer to me.
282,My two boys are signed up when they get old enough.
283,"Why?

Does it do anything for males?"
284,That seems pretty reasonable. I'm game.
285,I never got it. But I remember in college (u.s.) about 8 years ago now. I was told boys should get it. But I never did. Now I see these adds on Hulu and this going on in Europe. Now I'm worried as a younger adult male.... am I going to get cancer now??? I know my gf got the vaccine and we've been together for over 3 years. Now I'm all worried. 
286,"I really wish that the vaccine would have been advertised as an important thing for BOTH sexes when I got it (around 2005, if memory serves me correctly).

I'm a female in my late 20s. I got the HPV vaccine when I was about 14, I have been careful with sex partners and have also not had that many to begin with, yet I STILL got one of the dangerous cancer-causing strains that has no symptoms (found out just this year after my most recent pap). I have no idea which guy I got it from because, again, they were all ""clean"" at the time I had contact with them, and any of them could have easily been carriers. While I obviously never asked any of them, I'm betting none of them ever got the vaccine.

Something I was never told was that the vaccine DOES have a period of effectiveness that is usually only about 10 years, so people who get it at young ages (like I did) can STILL get the dangerous strains of HPV later on if they never got booster shots. Sadly, that's exactly what happened. It's quite a complex issue, and perhaps one that people need to be more heavily informed about.

Also, since men can't be tested for it, something I found disturbing was that when I got the phone call from the hospital to tell me that my pap had an abnormal result, the woman on the phone said, ""Don't worry. We make this call about 15 times a day. In fact, HPV is so common that we usually don't even recommend people to tell future partners about it, because more than 80% of the population has it."" And people wonder why it's on the rise. On one hand, men who are carriers continually spread it, and so do women, especially if they don't know they have it.

One more thing: through both my own research and through numerous conversations with my gynos, I learned that HPV can also be spread DESPITE condom use, through skin-to-skin contact. A condom only covers the shaft of the penis. This does not take into account skin-to-skin contact with the other parts of the genital area, which can also factor into HPV spreading.

Edit: a word"
287,100%. Why wouldn’t they. 
288,"Is this the vaccine that is like a 3-shot series you get a few months apart or something? The doctor asked if I was sexually active before I was and still recommended me getting the HPV vaccine before I was so I did. This was like 5 or 6 years ago, I don’t see  why you wouldn’t want to get it?"
289,"What about 50 year old, male or female?  Seems like it would not harm me."
290,"Hmmm I wonder if they will get the same sex shaming anti-vaccines arguments that girls got? When the vaccine first came out, some people were outraged since they though this would encourage girls to have sex. "
291,"How would I know definitively whether I received the HPV vaccination when I was an adolescent? 

I have no recollection of whether I received it or not. (I'm a US citizen having gone through the public school system)"
292,"I'm a UK citizen who has been considering getting this vaccine done privately for some time now. When, if ever, is this likely to be available through the NHS?"
293,"I got the shot in primary school, in year 8, and all of the girls didn’t have to pay because it was covered by the government. But if you were a boy, you would have to go and pay for the vaccine? It didn’t really make sense to me, but I’m they’re addressing this."
294,That shit/shot hurt like hell but I guess I’m glad I got it.
295,you should also get a pap schmear too.
296,Does anyone know if we can pay for it in the U.K. for boys if it isn’t available on the NHS 
297,"I'm unclear about what HPV is, I was under the impression it was like breast cancer or something that only affected things unique to women."
298,They are in the UK soon. 
299,I got it when I was enrolling in college
300,I got the vaccine as soon as it became available in France. I paid about 140 euro for it at the time.
301,"I’m 35 and my doctor refused to give me the vaccine because testing only went to age 27. I’ve likely already been exposed to some strains, but if I can protect from others, I want to.

How can I convince them to give me the vaccine?"
302,I just went to the clinic and said “give me everything you think I should have” and they gave me the HPV vaccine. Didn’t know it was a controversial thing.
303,"I have boy, girl twins that are now 18. Their pediatrician recommended years ago that both of them get the vaccine so we did."
304,Is this normal to give to girls now? I have a 5 year old daughter and she got all her shots.... I don't know exactly what they were other than the usual vaccines. Is this part of the usual routine?
305,"Im from the UK, Scotland. I've of course heard of HPV but with no reading into it had assumed this was exclusively for females as when I was in school they would be the only people to receive  the vaccine. Just goes to show how much education no matter how small plays a significant part in your perception of health issues, in whatever field. I'd have gladly took the vaccine if it meant people were safer in general 
 "
306,Wait so i don’t have warts than?
307,Maybe all humans since it's human papilloma. 
308,If i already took this once at 13 should i need it now at 17? Im currently sexually active
309,We've been covering this for 5 years on the No Agenda Show. 
310,This could have helped me 15 years ago
311,"As a 30 year old man, who did not know anything about this disease until I got warts 5 years ago, should I get the vaccine? Can I get the vaccine? Is there a way to get tested for penile cancer? I'm so confused by all of this, people say that you cannot get cancer from the type that gives you warts, but what if I have another type that I don't know about already? Clearly my body is not a good fighter against HPV on its own."
312,"Never understood this. When I received the vaccine, I was told the male can only spawn the disease. By administering the vaccine to males, does that not cut out the strain before it can be transmitted? Wouldn’t it be more effective to tackle the problem where it spawns?"
313,"This is perfect. If the anti vaccine nuts are correct, we should see a huge spike in vaccine injured boys. I wonder how they’ll spin this."
314,"I hate when the media makes HPV a woman's problem. Boys should be getting this vaccine, there needs to be more education about this!"
315,my mommy made me get this when i was like 12
316,"What was the reasoning behind only vaccinating girls? What effect does this have on herd immunity, given that (as far as I know) it isnt contiguous? Do boys born from vaccinated mothers have any form of hightened immunity? How does it help men, given that most men dont have a cervix -non cisgender men may vary, for obvious reasons-?
All questions I wish I was smart enough to answer."
317,Would of been nice 10 years ago..
318,"Not sure about other places, but in Australia it’s pretty common for boys to get the vaccine. "
319,"Woops, I've been giving it to my male patients for awhile"
320,Really? I'm a guy and recieved the vaccine last year (my mom told me to get it). 
321,"I got it last year, 3 injections with three month intervals. So it carries over to 2018."
322,Thankfully I had a good pediatrician and got the HPV vaccine when I was young. No sense to not get it (and I hate needles). 
323,"So all this talk about Roe VS Wade being nullified by the new Republican controlled supreme Court makes me wonder... Since it was more about having body autonomy and not really specific to abortions, would that open up a gateway for mandatory vaccinnations?"
324,Not necessarily this one but are their vaccines that work on one gender but not the other?
325,Wish I had gotten it prior to the age cutoff. Now I'm too old and I've been exposed to hpv-16 and now I'm a full blown hypochondriac when it comes to my throat. 
326,I wish I had gotten it. So many head and neck cancers could be avoided. 
327,"I'm pretty sure I have this.

My step-mother works for a company that manufactures it and she and my dad highly recommended I get it."
328,Brazillians have vaccination for HPV FOR FREE for BOYS between 11 and 14 AND GIRLS between 9 and 14. And there is a tendency to enlarge this age gap. Brazil has one of the most abrangent FREE vaccination programs in the world. Universal health care <3 <3 
329,You mean people dont? I got it when I was like 10.
330,"Sigh. There was a mass vaccination campaign here in Australia for it as well that only targeted girls. I'm not sure which bright spark thought it was a good idea to only target girls, but any immunologist worth their salt knows that <50% of the population (females-non vaccinated females) was never going to comprehensively eradicate the disease."
331,"In Australia, we have a HPV vaccination program in schools for all 12-13 year olds regardless of gender. No cost to families. "
332,"Which is kind of an about face because while looking for the full text, I found this report ([Teenage boys shouldn’t be given HPV vaccine, says joint committee](https://www.bmj.com/content/358/bmj.j3523)) from the same journal, the British Medical Journal, from exactly a year ago claiming the exact opposite. 

I'm no expert, so can someone explain the new reasoning as to why they flipped their decision?"
333,"I believe that in Australia we didnt test for HPV in regular female gyno checkups until last year!!! Also, once you have HPV you cannot get rid of it... it only becomes dormant.. that was my understanding. Someone please fact check me."
334,Huh I had to get 3 doses of the HPV vaccine (am male) at quite a young age. I was probably like 12 (am 20 now). Almost all the guys I know in Oregon are vaccinated. Didn’t realize it wasn’t as common to vaccinate until I went to uni and a bunch of out of state students didn’t have the HPV vaccine or never even heard of it. 
335,"Since boys are the ones that actually spread it...or nearly anything, it would make a lot of since to just vacciinate all boys with all available std vaccines and save everyone a lot of trouble."
336,I paid over $700 in Canada to get it as a male about 7 years ago. 
337,Its nice to see somebody is playing the long game out there.
338,"I was of the understanding men are the carriers and infectors

only treating females deals with half the problem only"
339,....boys? Trudeau would like a word.
340,Why not both genders for all diseases that might be caught/transmitted by both?
341,"My younger son was the lone boy to get it at our pediatrician’s office for years. I requested it and they were thrilled. The nurse told me that all the parents seemed shocked when asked if they wanted their son(s) to get the series, like it was unheard of for teenage boys to be exposed to something sexually communicable and, even more importantly, since the boys couldn’t get cervical cancer, it wasn’t their problem. "
342,"Yeah, I'll take a free shot.

Dibs on using the needle First!!"
343,Unfortunately most insurance doesn't cover it if you're over 25 and it's almost a thousand dollars. 
344,? I got this a while ago...
345,"I work in this industry. Get your HPV vaccine if you’re 26 and under. Not for STD prevention, but cancer prevention. If you think you won’t get cancer, then get it because you don’t want genital warts and having to explain that to every female (or male) ever. :)

Also, to clear up a common misconception, HPV is a bodily fluid type of disease - not insertion. "
346,"I want to get it but every time I ask about it, my doctors tell me my insurance doesn’t cover it. Then I tell them I’ll pay and they say because I’m over 26, it’s assumed I’m infected. I’m just trying to play it safe, work with me doctors."
347,My doctor made me get that a year ago.
348,"But if there’s no approved test for HPV in men, how do you know if the vaccine is effective?"
349,"It was compulsory for our year level to get it, and I go to a boys' school. I don't know what HPV is but I wasn't aware there were gender specific vaccines."
350,I thought that was the standard procedure?
351,"My insurance provider says ""no they shouldn't"", and I'm not about to drop $550 (that's before paying for the doctor's appointment) for one of the STD that can maybe, sort of, possibly lead to a situation that could but won't necessarily lead to something serious.

"
352,so does it not work on old fucks like me or what?
353,all adventurous women do
354,P=e\*\*kt . Where k represent the transmission constant. Vaccinating boys will reduce  transmission and greatly reduce the number of people infected which will greatly reduce the number of people that will die from cervix cancer. 
355,What about a reliable test for men? Last time I asked I had to try to find a specialist and she seemed to discourage me unless I was receiving anal sex or had HIV/AIDS.
356,"In New Zealand the HPV vaccine is available free to all under 27 year olds. 
It's given to boys and girls aged 11 years at school.
It was just for girls but now both."
357,Already got! Years agooo
358,"That’s because they pushed it as a way to prevent some types of cervical cancers instead of actually preventing HPV. I remember getting the vaccine in school for free somewhere between 2007-2009, but I don’t think the guys had to get it."
359,"Wait, boys aren’t getting vaccinated what????"
360,"Stupid question, but if the woman cant get it because they are inoculated, how would the men get it if there sleeping with inoculated woman. Can you catch it like the common cold or something like that. "
361,"That's what I always thought since ever I looked for more information on HPV, after seeing the vaccine advisory notice for girls at my doctor's clinic (was in 8th grade at the time), but each time I asked about it - every medical professional said that ""there's no point""."
362,"I thought they already did.  I got one when I was 18, four years ago."
363,I wish this was decided last year....
364,Can't find anywhere in the article what HPV vaccine is actually for. Cancer maybe?
365,I thought this was common knowledge.
366,"probably, but they say men have money so they have to pay for it themselves, then they said the vaccine is more effective for women instead and it was a waste of tax resources."
367,I remember being 26 years old going to Planned Parenthood and asking for the HPV immunization.  They told me because I was over 23 years old I wasn't likely to contract it and therefore they wouldn't give me the immunization..  10 years later and most of my girlfriends / sexual partners have all been between 21 and 23.  
368,They started giving it out for free to under 28yo just after I turned 28 here :(
369,"I mean I could pay 30 quid for one days access to the article or I can spend that money on mountain dew and beef jerky while developing aggresive, uninformed opinions on everything around me."
370,Haha first ligma now this
371,I offer the vaccine series to both boys and girls starting at 11 years old. 
372,"In Australia, boys and girls get HPV vaccine in Year 10."
373,Vaccines were up for debate?
374,"The fact that the HPV vaccine wasn’t outright recommended for boys at the outset is absurd. There was no known serious side effects. Women were getting cancer from a virus spread to them by their partners. 

It’s like if we had just let Typhoid Mary run amok. 

Sure, boys weren’t getting cancer, but there was no downside. It would have significantly increased herd immunity at little cost. Also, recommending it to girls only fuels anti-vax arguments. “If they aren’t recommending it to everyone, then there must be some coverup.”"
375,They definitely should. A girl I was seeing told me she had it and thought it was okay and that it doesn't even manifest in guys. Thankfully she said this before we did anything and I nope'd her. 
376,[deleted]
377,Did they reach this consensus before hitting the joint?
378,"Thanks for your time and patience. 

I have another question. I heard the benefits of the shot only last 4-5 years. My oldest got the vaccine 6 years ago. Does that mean she is no longer protected? My insurance hounded me to get her series of shots done. But no one ever said anything about a booster later. Ever. I was told after 3 shots she’d be all done. Which is true?

I’ve heard that a large percentage of women die from cervical cancer. I’ve also heard that 95% of women infected with HPV never get cervical cancer. Are those also both true?

Before the vaccine, what was the treatment for the the complications the vaccination inoculates against when caught on an abnormal Pap smear?"
379,Sanevax.org has many stories. 
380,"Uhhh, yes they should!"
381,Guy here. Mother is a physician. I got the gardasil shot. No issues at all. Why wouldn't we want to protect each other from a cancer causing virus? 
382,"My mom swears I got vaccinated for it when I was younger, however I just learned last week that the two bumps I’ve had on my finger for a few years is actually a strain of HPV."
383,"I got mine. However, not long after I met a girl who had a weird side effect of becoming allergic to the cold.

Has anyone else had any odd side effects? "
384,"My son turned 11 recently and my wife and I decided for him to have this vaccine even though its not required. 

Why would this be a choice I have no idea."
385,"A few years I had a short relationship with a woman who ended up getting cervical cancer.  Shortly after I asked my doctor for an HPV vaccine, and she just kinda himmed and hawwwed about it, so I am still probably a carrier..."
386,Adults over the age of 26 can't get the vaccine because it isnt approved for them. Anybody else think this is crazy?
387,I’m not even going to read through the comments. Just saying that I recall taking this shot back when I was in High School and that was around 5 years ago 
388,I too got it like almost a decade ago
389,Holy crap man America so damn backwards. In Canada we all get it in grade 7 at school.
390,Can adults still get the vaccine?
391,Does anyone know if the vaccine is at least semi effective if you’ve only had 2 doses as a kid? 
392,"I just got my Second shot yesterday. The wierd thing is. In Denmark boys have to pay for it even though it is more common for boys to need it. Girls get it for 0 dollars, tax payers pay for it and boys have to pay around 80 dollars (500 DKK) "
393,Knowing I could have oral HPV is terrifying
394,I was told specifically by my doctor that it would not befefit me and/or my partner(s) and that I 'didn't need to worry about it'. He wouldn't even hear any argument I made after that and promptly left the room. I am currently looking for a new doctor in Southern Ontario. 
395,Invest in big pharmaceutical companies today!
396,Plenty of reports showing teen girls who took it are now having miscarriages. They can’t push the drug on girls anymore so now off to the boys. Do your research.
397,"I thought the male HPV vaccine had some serious contraindications for children, like sudden death. Did that change?

Edit: To clarify, my pharmacist said her issue was with another medication he was taking at the time and that the school had the vaccine on a list of recommended vaccines for the school year. She apparently didn't agree with it being recommended for 10 year-olds instead of teenagers. My bad."
398,this propaganda is brought to you by the same huckster responsible for the opioid epidemic.
399,Why do I feel like I got my vaccinations for HPV years ago
400,[removed]
401,[removed]
402,"If you know anything about HPV, is that every single living thing has it. (Look this up)

The virus if it goes haywire in the body for natural reasons, wears off in weeks off a healthy body. (look this up)

A girl who is 12 years old and is not sexually active - should not need a vaccine. Same for boys.

In Colombia, this was a huge thing not so long ago where distressed girls were coming forward about the vaccine and how it was affecting them and even killing some but the Government wasn't doing anything about it.

This Vaccine thing is getting scary.. and were all just keep getting more scared..."
403,"Why are our grandparents life expectancy longer than ours now even though they had minimal vaccines and archaic Healthcare? The Companies making this vaccines stock shoot up on announcing this. Vaccines are a necessity, but maybe we are over doing it for corporate Greed not public health? Look at Cuba who do not gouge and profit but are in the top 3 of global health initiatives and vaccine drives. "
404,[removed]
405,Invest in the pharmaceutical stock now! Money money money!! It's no big deal if it causes injuries the U.S. government has a taxpayer fund for that! It will not effect the stock price or the pharmaceutical company at all! Buy now. Despite numerous warnings in the package the general perception is these can not hurt anyone. I'm going all in! Vaccines from cradle to the retirement home!!! More will be recommended each year!!! Let's get rich. :)
406,Does anyone know if the vaccine is a ‘live’ vaccine or a ‘dead’ vaccine? Just curious for immunosuppressed individuals and whether or not it would be safe.
407,[deleted]
408,ELI5 is it something like hiv since it has „h“ in his name?
409,Can someone explain to me what a HPV vaccine is? Like what does it prevent me from? How does it do it? 
410,"It's weird to me that you can't get the vaccine in the US past the age of 28 - like viruses, cancer, and STDs give a crap about your age..."
411,And the joint committee is made up of who?
412,Question: if vaccines put small amounts of a virus/disease in a body so the body can create a better immune response but HPV is an incurable disease that once you have you can never lose.  How does it not stay in the recipient
413,"I remember finding out about the vaccine around the age of 24/25 and begging my doctor to give it to me because why the fuck not? If I'm more likely to carry it, then that's my responsibility. My insurance covered it for men under 26 and there was a waiting period between each shot (3 total)...I just barely made it but I'm glad I did it."
414,"There is no reason not to have this vaccine. While there are hundreds of strains of HPV, men don't show symptoms for the majority of them. They just pass it on and the body just ""cures"" it on it's own in the background. The guy would never know, and this is why the majority of men have no idea about this. "
415,Yeah that's not one my children are getting. If they want it when they get older that's up to them.
416,What's next???? Mandatory gender reassignment surgeries and breast implants??? I'd rather my boy died of HPV or cancer than become a sissssyyyy!!!!!!!!!!! '____'
417,"I'll pass, will wait until all of the research that says it causes late life autism or mental illness has been debunked or disproved."
418,[removed]
419,Yet more meds because rather than teaching self-respect and dignity to people we encourage them into empty and senseless behaviors. What could go wrong? 
420,"Potentially dumb question, but doesn't it have no ill effects on men, it just makes them a carrier of the disease? Unless you are sleeping around you should not be exposing yourself to sources of it and transferring it to others, seems like an unneeded vaccine."
421,"I had 18 warts all over my body, I had tried getting them Frozen off and burned off with acid for 6+ months straight. this meant for 6 months my hands were taped up, my knee was taped up, my palm was taped up, I had tape everywhere and not only was it on comfortable, it was embarrassing. After being told numerous times that there is no cure for HPV or no better way to get rid of them than freezing or salicylic acid, I took matters into my own hands and formulated a salve lotion for me. I used 500mg of CBD, .4g of decarbed THC oil, and I dissolved and mix them into coconut oil. I took this solution and applied it to my warts once a night for three weeks, and the warts continuously shrunk and shrunk until they disappeared and now I have been wart free for several years.
          
"
422,[removed]
423,"Why don’t men get this? I had mine, but then again I live in the US. "
424,I think it's good of boys/men get this but it shouldn't be required
425,Good way to get more money. The committee are all favorable to the vaccine maker and most likely paid and rewarded for having this finding. 
426,Sounds like something big pharma would push. Is there any indication of conflict of interest in any of the research? 
427,"I asked for one at Planned Parenthood when I was 22, and they refused to provide me with one "
428,HPV passes through condoms... just saiyin

430,It's almost like they want to encourage more people to become anti-vaxxers.
431,"Is it still useful to get one as an adult, or do they just give it to sixth graders?"
432,[removed]
433,It probably goes without saying everyone should be getting the ligma vaccine as well.
434,"Y tho?

No point in sterilizing boys. "
435,May I remind everyone that this only prevents about 6 kinds of HPV and there are a lot more out there... bet your doctor never told you that!!!
436,Are you assuming their gender?
437,I think the world is overpopulated yet I would like to force everyone to be vaccinated so that they will live forever.  Is this a recipe for cognitive dissonance or no? 'Cause it does feel weird when I think how apposed some of my beliefs are to each other.
438,It’s only useful for females. There have been no studies about the effects and what it can do to a young male. 
439,"Wonder how many people are gonna defend this, even though HPv is 100% untestable currently in boys, and if it’s not testable how the hell are you gonna test a vaccine? Change my mind"
440,Can someone explain to me why children are being given shots for STDs? This is getting a little creepy. 
441,"Do not get this vaccine!  Do not give this vaccine to children!  This is a horrid mistake.  Should you or your child contract HPV, get the warts removed and take an anti-viral med.   I have taken care of too many people who have “mysteriously “ come down with Giuliano-Barre Syndrome after taking this vaccine.  "

445,.... Just don't have sex with people with STDs maybe? 
446,"all these vaccines that were given to the older generations + the ones still given to our youth, most of them ain’t worth a f***, their all bad for our health, they are the # 1 reason  behind Autism and lots of all other complications in our kids even adults. VACCINES ARE BAD FOR US! 
💯💯💯"
447,I'd rather teach him about birth control and personal responsibility than risk the side effects. He can decide to get it when he's older.
448,HPV can cause hodgkins lymphoma in men 
449,What the hell does the opinion of a bunch of potheads matter on this issue? Who cares?
450,"It's interesting that the rates are different between men and women. Is it because many women are already vaccinated, or because it is easier to contract from certain types of intercourse?"
451,"[Epidemiology and Pathology of HPV in males](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825810000892)

For those who want more scientific articles. 

Men have a significant role in transmission of HPV. It is linked to some anal carcinomas, penile cancers, and a subset of head & neck carcinomas likely caused by high-risk HPV infections which Gardasil prevents/protects against."
452,"Also, hpv causes penile cancer. Everyone should get the vaccination."
453,"I was one of those men, being diagnosed in February. Its been a terrifying and grueling 6 months of surgeries, as well as  radiation and chemo. My elderly parents have often wished that this had been available when i was a child. The upside is its very treatable when caught early. The downside is the treatments are incredibly harsh and somewhat disfiguring. "
454,Would the vaccine prevented all these cases?  I thought the vaccine was only for a specific strain and there were several strains?
455,Thanks for the suggestion and for keeping it updated!
456,"Wouldn’t it be cool if you could easily see what you’ve been vaccinated for in a single central database!? 

We should do that!"
457,Why was this pushed on women so much more than men if the rates of cancer are so much higher in men? Is it like breast cancer vs prostate cancer where prostate cancer is extremely common but seldom lethal but breast cancer is frequently lethal?
458,"Unfortunately, the vaccine is not approved for HPV-associated head and neck cancers. Hopefully more research will be done regarding this!"
459,"What about the gardasil lawsuits? All the related deaths? The lack of thorough testing before release? That it wasn't tested for carcinogenic properties itself or any effect on fertility? Yes that's right - this vaccine that was *only tested on 1600 girls(no males!!)* was not tested for effect on fertility? Seems like a big money grab to me considering how few people are ever actually effected by HPV. 

It has never had clinical trials done with men yet somehow its suddenly OK? Or is it just double profits for merck? 

Here's a great article people should check out before flipping out on me for pointing this stuff out. 



https://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/31/us-court-pays-6-million-gardasil-victims/
"
460,Wait... does that mean boys and girls are different? *hmm...*
461,Gotta love gender equality! 
462,I study HNSCC and I was vaccinated for HPV due to our work.
463,"My goodness, it paints a new picture when all those outbreaks are consolidated into 1 thread like that."
464,Just totally ignoring herd immunity and innoculating people against hurting their partners. 
465,I think theres similarly shocking facts about breast cancer statistics and gender iirc
466,Wow those numbers are small against the size of the population. Why don't they make a vaccine for something more prevalent ?
467,"Huh, went to the drs back in september and they kept trying to push new vaccines on me (not antivaxx just not what i went in for) and they asked if i wanted the hpv vaccine

""Idk what that is""
Oh well its basically (big words i couldn't make heads or tails of)

""...""
Ill have the doc explain it (after spending like 10 minutes trying to talk me into it)

I ask the doc what it is and they seem kinda surprised

""Well you really only need it if you're a woman or gay""

... i'm neither..."
468,I’m trans (mtf) but luckily I got this vaccine! I remember my mother was wary of it at first but as soon as I heard “penile cancer” I said vaccinate me.  
469,"My ex's sister got it because of the vaccine, so i never got it myself. I heard similar cases in college. "
470,"The sexism against men continues

Edit: It is sexist that it has taken 10+ years for men to even be considered for the vaccince"
471,"Yes and no. There are several strains of HPV, and each is associated with different levels of risk for HPV-related cancer.

It's entirely possible that even if you have HPV, if you contracted a strain which isn't associated with cancer, you might benefit from vaccination because it could prevent a new infection with one of the cancer-associated strains."
472,[deleted]
473,[deleted]
474,"The most recent vaccine protects against 9 strains against HPV, some of them are known to cause cancer and some prevent against the strains that cause genital warts. Studies have shown that even if you’ve been exposed to one of the strains you can be protected against the others. It also doesn’t protect against all of the cancerous HPV strains so everyone should still exercise caution. "
475,"Young women (before the age of 21) tend to clear the virus completely following exposure. I don't know if this is true for men, though. I have no reason to believe that it wouldn't be true for men, but this finding for women is the basis for the current recommendation to start pap smears on women at age 21 regardless of when they first have sexual activity. (Pelvic exams should begin earlier based on sexual activity for STI's, there's just no reason to screen for cervical cancer at a younger age) The HPV vaccine should be given as early as possible, but it may still be effective if given after the very first exposure."
476,[deleted]
477,"They did a study on this once actually. They took people who had active HPV (which they had a special test for) and measured clearance rate between a control group and a group that received the Gardisil vaccine. Both groups cleared the virus in the same amount of time (about a year max). Remember, HPV is not like Herpes. Most people completely clear the virus within two years, and you'll be immune to the strains you clear for life."
478,Yes. My doctor recommended it in exactly this situation. It still protects against other strains. 
479,"Yeah I kind of want to know this too u/3195715311

Also I heard you can't get the vaccine past a certain age?"
480,"In my area (Washington State, USA) they Gardasil at middle & high schools...trying to get to kids before they become sexually active. "
481,"I got mine as a safety before college, it's *possible* I had exposure before but not likely.  Cancer is the killer in my genes, so I prevent as many kinds as I can."
482,"Depends. There are 9 strains of HPV that the current vaccine (Gardasil) offers protection from; if you have been exposed to one, but not the others, it might still help. "
483,"Yes, it protects against the types you have not been exposed to. Unfortunately there is no way or knowing (at least for males) what strain you have/had before. Being covered, even for at least once could potentially be the difference between staying healthy or developing HPV-related cancers.

I got my vaccine at age 26 through planned parenthood. My insurance covered most of the cost and I ended up paying around 30 bucks for the entire thing. Its 3 vaccines given within a 6 month period. Yes I had already been sexually active before getting the vaccine.

Edit: am male too."
484,"The most recent vaccine covers 9 strains of which 7 are for cancer and 2 are wart causing ones. The majority (80%) of those infected will shed the virus within 18 months; the younger the infected the more likely to shed. Which means for those that “had” the virus they may have shed it and the vaccine would be effective at reinfection. The older we get the less likely we are to shed the virus. Which means it’s more important as we get older - so vaccinate when you are young! For instance, rates of cancer recurrence dropped from 8.5% to only 2.5% risk after vaccination and rates of recurrence of external genital warts dropped from 47% to only 14% after vaccination. HPV is very important in both men and women for example, the vaccine decreases rates of external genital warts by 89% and anal cancer by 78%. Another important point is that HPV should no longer be thought of as a woman issue. Oropharyngeal cancer caused by HPV is rising and surpasses that of cervical cancer (Canadian data). Men are 4.5 X more likely to have oropharyngeal cancer caused by HPV than women. I got the vaccine when I was a Family Medicine resident after learning how effective and safe it is. In Canada (some provinces) started offering the vaccine to both boys and girls this last year in the grade 7 year. For me, a girl, I got it since it decreases the rate of cervical cancer by 97% and external genital warts by almost 100%. Note, essentially all cervical cancers are caused by HPV (albeit except for the really rare causes). As you can see - I’m passionate about this vaccine!"
485,"The vaccine covers several strains of HPV, the original vaccine ""gardasil 4"" covered 4 strains, the current vaccine covers 9... and you guessed it, is called ""gardasil 9"" 

While getting the vaccine after you have had an infection, limits its effectiveness it can still cover strains you did not get."
486,"This vaccine will do you no benefit if you have already been infected by the virus. However, it is extremely beneficial in preventative measures. That's why you should get this vaccine no matter your age if you have never had it. There are hundreds of different strains of HPV, the vaccine only covers the ones you are most likely to get. There are low risk and high risk HPV strains. The low risk ones will not cause cancer and the high risk ones (i.e. 16 and 18) will. The vaccine does cover these!

So it is in your best interest to get the vaccine if you have never had it. Please do!

Source: just had an exam on HPV in dental school recently. "
487,This is specifically in the UK. It has been recommended for boys in the US for several years now.
488,"Yeah, the fact that the vaccine is at least somewhat useful to men has been known for a while, but this study was specifically looking at the overall cost-effectiveness, from the perspective of the UK government. When you have a government-funded National Health Service, there's that extra specific question on a marginally-effective treatment as to whether it's overall an effective use of money relative to other things.

In this case, the overall reduction in future cancer treatment makes the cost of extending the vaccination program beneficial to the health system in and of itself, before you even have to start arguing about whether it's personally beneficial to people."
489,It's a UK cost analysis to justify the NHS paying for it.

492,"I’m 23 and had no idea if I got one or not. I must have said “yeah sure idgaf” when my doc asked me because I checked my records to see I got the 3 stage Gardisal.

So happy I did because I’m dating a girl now who has HPV and even though it’s crazy common I don’t particularly want it and I definitely wouldn’t want to spread it to future partners."
493,Any good pediatrician pushed it for guys. 
494,Here in Australia boys have been given it for years. 
495,The clinic we take our kids to has been recommending the vaccine for all teenagers for at least 5 years.  My kids are 16 and 17 and they had the three shot cycle about 3 years ago.
496,In Sweden it's been recommended (but not very well known) for boys but it's not yet free as with girls. They're trying to change that is what I heard last year when I got mine.
497,"Yea I got it before I started freshman year of college. I remember because I handled that shot like a champ and only cried for 20 minutes.

The TB test...that was a different experience "
498,"It's most useful for girls since they're overwhelmingly more vulnerable to it. I'm a guy and I was never told about HPV vaccines. I was barely even aware of the disease. About two years ago, I had (protected) sex with a girl who was HPV-positive but she didn't tell me at first because “it wouldn't affect [me].” I was kinda pissed. After research it for a bit, I decided to continue having a (protected) sexual relationship with her. I mean, the probability that I'd get penile cancer is very low.

We drunkenly had unprotected sex once, so if I hadn't contracted HPV before then, I likely did then. If I did contract it, then I still have no idea if my body successfully eliminated it. But I can never possibly know whether or not I have it because there is no test for men. So now I must assume that I have it and must inform all future partners beforehand.

I wish that I got vaccinated so that it never needs to be the topic of a discussion with future partners. My pharmacist was happy to give me a vaccine. My insurance was even going to fully cover it. But I'm twenty-six and have already had intercourse with an HPV-positive person. Why bother at this point, right?"
499,It's because in females lesions tend to internal (and thus go unnoticed) but in males the lesions tend to be obviou
500,"Sexual health is the sole responsibility of women, didn't you get the memo?"
501,"It's marketed to girls because they're the ones who are far more likely to suffer from malignant cancers directly related to the virus, which is a bit more of a push factor than just having incurable genital tumors."
502,"Can boys be carriers of HPV?

Yes?

There's your answer."
503,It doesn't do anything if you already have the virus though right? Is there even a way to test for it in males?
504,Same
505,When I got it in school only the girls were given it. 
506,As far as I know public health insurance only covers the HPV vaccine for women who are under 18 here in Germany. It is also marketed as “cervical cancer vaccine” so most people don’t even realise that it would also profit men as well.
507,"It helps to prevent many cancers in men (penile, throat, anal), as well as warts. In addition, if a male is protected from HPV then he of course can't spread it to females. So both genders being vaccinated benefits everybody.

Particularly noteworthy since preventing penile cancer is one common justification for circumcision of male infants and young boys. But now there's a vaccine..."
508,Yeah I got it six years ago and I’m a guy. 
509,"HPV generally shows no signs and has no negative effects for men, for women on other hand... well, the most common type that is. "
510,Remember when the vaccine first came out. Asked for it and was denied because I am male. 
511,I requested it as a teenager and they wouldn't give it to me because they were only giving it to girls in like 2006
512,There's no reason not to give it to boys too. What are you afraid of? They might be TOO healthy?
513,"I got it a few years ago as well, right after my dad was diagnosed with cancer. As soon as it was determined that his cancer was caused by HPV, I hurried out and got it.

I was surprised by this headline too, as it sounds like you were! "
514,I thought it was because for boys its really hard to get cervical cancer.
515,I got this vaccination too. Didn’t realize it wasn’t a standard thing for boys.
516,"When it first came out it wasn't even anything anyone bothered telling parents about with boys.  I could have avoided contracting and spreading to everyone that I meet and shake hands with :) neat right!?

Thankfully the stuff that a majority of the population comes in contact with is not the virus that causes uterine/rectal cancers, but even still."
517,Yeah. I got it too. 
518,"This is news to me. I'm 27, and I remember girls basically requiring it, but boys? No mention of it to us."
519,"At the very beginning, they actually wouldn’t even give it to boys! I’m female and have a twin brother. When it first came out, I was early teens so I got the vaccine. Our mom, who’s a nurse practitioner and worked in OB/GYN and family planning for years, wanted my brother to get it, too, but they absolutely refused. Not quite clear on the reasoning. In any case, a few years later they finally started giving it to boys (although I think you had to ask for it, instead of it being recommended) and my brother got it then. I’m glad they’re recognizing it’s importance for both sexes!"
520,"My doctor recommended the HPV (Gardasil) vaccine to me, said it could prevent penile cancer.

You don't have to tell me twice to take the anti-your-penis-falling-off medicine."
521,"I don't have a source for this, and it might have been commented elsewhere already, but I remember learning that males are very often carriers of HPV and it doesn't really affect their health or even present any symptoms. Obviously not in every case, but most. This means that men can HAVE HPV and pass it on to the women they sleep with and not even know it. I could be horribly wrong, but I do remember learning about this and it's a scary thought!"
522,My 15 year old son had both shots before finishing middle school. We are in the US. 
523,Need to check my shot record. But fairly certain that it was required by my university. Maybe it's a state by state thing.
524,I thought it was a common practice too. My son was given it this year at his school (In Canada). 
525,"I got mine when I was 15(?). I remember complaining that I didn't need it blah blah blah, but I'm glad I got it now. Boy did those three shots hurt though, my arm was sore for a couple days after each. "
526,"I don't think I received it, but my son certainly did. When I asked about it, they said it helps to fight testicular cancer or something along those lines."
527,"I just got my 3rd (last) HPV vaccine a week ago and I'm 23, my Dr recommended it"
528,How is it useful for men?
529,"Do you too have traumatic memories of the booster?

Man that hurt... but not going in like a flu shot. Two seconds later, just long enough to let my guard down... "
530,"Yeah, it causes anal cancer, penile cancer, and throat cancer in guys so there's no reason not to "
531,"I went in for an STI check in college (about a decade ago) and the woman said that HPV is more harmful to women, but men can give it to them. So I said I may as well get the vaccine. They told me it was free for women and $500 for men.

Seems kinda dumb to do that. Not sure how it is these days."
532,"I got it when I was active with my then girlfriend. 

Then I never put it to use after ;_; feelsbadman.vac"
533,"As a dude I got my HPV 10, maybe 8, years ago? I thought it was the norm for awhile now "
534,I'm 28 and I had never heard of it even being offered to guys 
535,"I tried to get it at a Planned Parenthood, and they refused to provide it. This was about 5-7 years ago"
536,"In case anyone hasn't added it's because HPV is just HPV in men, but is a cause of cervical cancer in women. "
537,I asked for it at 28 and was told by my doctor that it’s not supposed to be given to men after 26. This was in Ohio.
538,"I am a man. I was born long enough ago that it came out after I was an adult, but not by much. 

When I was in my early 20s I heard about it through reddit actually and decided I wanted to get it, mostly for the sake of future sex partners. My doctor at the time told me he would not give it to me because I was a man and ""it wouldn't do anything"".

At some point in my life I contracted hpv and at 24 I ended up with genital warts. It was honestly pretty traumatic for me as I have always been really careful with condoms and my fiance at the time who was very sexually inhibited and also a huge hypochondriac really freaked out. She ended up breaking up with me not long after.

But here is the other part. My new doctor after removing the warts, wrote me a prescription and strongly suggested that I get the vaccine because apparently it diminishes the chances of reoccurance and of transmission. But I was almost 25 and it requires 3 treatments at about $500 each without insurance, administered about 3 months apart or something like that. I would only be under 25 for the first treatment and my insurance refused to cover it for anyone over 25.

I asked my parents to help out financially and I was eventually able to eat the $1000 cost. But Walgreens refused to fill the prescription at all. They told me if my insurance wouldn't cover it they wouldn't fill my prescription even if I was willing to pay out of pocket.

I still am boycotting Walgreens to this day.

TLDR; The medical industry is full of people who won't entertain treatments like this. "
539,Yep got it for free in the military. If anyone is reading this in the US military go get that shit. It's free and gets you out of work for a little bit. 
540,"Yeah I got it a few years ago, was told it had always been girls getting it but guys now too. "
541,I got both of my boys vaccinated. The youngest was 12 when we finished the series. They were both slow to get out of bed. The youngest asked “What is HPV?” He then Googled it and then showed his brother. We made it to the appt on time.
542,"My parents bought it for my brother and I, then all of a sudden the government started doing them for free.."
543,Came here to say this...both me (male) and my sister were vaccinated for HPV. Thought this was common knowledge. 
544,">This is just coming out? I got the vaccine a few years back, and was given the impression it was useful regardless of gender

Are you autsitic yet? "
545,"When it first became available, it was marketed primarily to girls, because it can cause cervical cancer. I never understood why it would be totally ok for boys to be carriers and girls to just be protecting themselves. Why the hell would you want *anyone* to have HPV?"
546,"I got it too, almost 10 years ago. This seems like such a no-brainer."
547,"I was told, in the military, that if you were a male that it wasn't recommended or needed so they weren't going to give it to us even if we elected. "
548,Do you have to be younger for it to be effective? A guy I worked with just got diagnosed with this cancer. If I can avoid it by taking a vaccine I would but I am a bit older now 
549,I received it as well. Never thought much of it
550,It's marketed more to women because while it does have some risk increases for men and women like a higher chance of cancer overall but for women it can increase ovarian cancer change by up to 50% so women are more susceptible. Kind of a flawed logic though considering men can spread it to women or vice versa. 
551,"It's weird. I've been confused about this for years - is the vaccine hard to make? Why limit it to girls? Effectively 100% of humans can contract HPV - even if it isn't a big risk for cancer in 50% of the population, why would you leave that 50% as carriers assuming that a majority of them are going to interact with other humans at some point?

It's like if we only vaccinated boys or girls respectively for polio, or measles, or anything else you can vaccinate against - herd immunity, which is most important for the most vulnerable, doesn't work if you don't vaccinate huge chunks of the population on the assumption that they aren't vulnerable to medical consequences.  


edit: fuck, men can get cancer from it too (head/neck, anal, etc) so, yeah, why only market it to one sex when both sexes can be seriously harmed by contracting it, and it's extremely common...?"
552,Girls received the vax free while boys had to pay for it.
553,I didnt even know it was applicable to males.
554,"They have been running ads for the hpv vaccine for several years in the US. They make you feel very quilty for not giving it to kids. Something along the lines of "" don't you love me mom"". So I researched what it actually did. My son turned 11 and he got the first shot. He just finished his last dose. Afaik, all doctors are bringing it up to parents. I've had several offers to vaccinate him for hpv. "
555,"Girls got it for free in middle school when I went (8 years ago), guys “didn’t need it”. 

Now everyone says boys should get it too, and the last time I went to the doctor for a check up she asked. **$600**. I’m a university student, I don’t have that kind of money"
556,They’re also marketing it to boy’s parents now too. A few nights ago I saw an ad that basically said it’s your fault if your kid gets cancer since you didn’t get him the vaccine. 
557,"Most boys never received it. You had to get it privately at your own expense and inconvenience, and be within a specific date range. I think it was only licensed for age 18 and below, so if you're over that age you couldn't even pay for it. I had to get mine in the US because of that."
558,"Yes it's useful for both genders. The virus shuts down your [p53 tumor suppressor pathway](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/P53) which all humans posses. There are many [high risk strains](https://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/hpv-virus-information-about-human-papillomavirus) that cause many forms of cancer in both men and women. The [HPV Vaccine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccine) prevents four strains of HPV, including two common high risk strains from persisting."
559,"I think the timeline for the HPV vaccine went something like:

1.  HPV protects women from some types of common cervical cancer (that men can't get for lack of a cervix).

2.  Oh yeah, men can still transmit HPV...

3.  Oh, maybe HPV can cause different types of cancers in men.

4.  Oh, wow.  Looks like the HPV vaccine might actually treat some kinds of (IIRC *skin*) cancers (?) in people that already have cancer.

I don't have years or anything, I just remember my GP telling me 8 to 10 years ago that I didn't need the HPV vaccine because (1) I am male and (2) wasn't engaging in risky sex."
560,I’m guessing if we already have it it’s no use huh?
561,"It’s useless and only protects against one strain, so you risk getting a more severe strain"
562,"It was recommended for me to get my daughter vaccinated but nothing was mentioned about my son.  

Disappointing.  

Now I see commercials bout the HPV vaccine on TV and feel like I should have asked about it.     Too late now, I guess."
563,In Canada up until last year men had to pay for it (it was like $400 too).
564,"You can only get it up to a certain age for men too, I believe. I recently opted to get mine, and was told they don't vaccinate men for HPV after 27 years old.

Not sure why, would anyone care to shed some light on why they told me that?"
565,My doctor heavily recommended I get it a few years back so I did... weird 
566,"I thought it was already a thing where I live. That said, I got it when it came out. Luckily my insurance covered it.

I was a 26 year old man at the time if memory serves."
567,Yeah I got it around 10 years ago and I thought that it was the consensus then.
568,I actually asked my doctor for it and she told me not to get it.... :/
569,"""Marketed"""
570,It's one of the scheduled vaccines that the kids get at school in in yr7 here in Australia. Boys and girls.

577,You really can find the exact right person on reddit. I remember on a askscience thread about insect muscles and their strength relative to size and our muscles there was a guy who wrote his PhD paper on exactly that. Things are funny that way.
578,"I turn 27 in a couple days, and never had the vaccine due to being older than required and just never hearing about it. Is there anything to consider about why not to get it? Besides possibility of insurance not paying and costing more?"
579,"Thanks for your work in studying and spreading the word about HPV vaccines, esp. for boys. I wasn’t told about the HPV vaccine and that I was able to get it until I was a sexually actively college student! I’m glad it’s being recommended for kids of all gender these days, but I worry there are still a lot of young men out there who don’t recognize it as something applicable to them."
580,Thanks for your work!  My master's thesis wasn't nearly so useful. 
581,">4. Gay men are not often thought of when it comes to immunizations, but they clearly benefit as well.

I live in Scotland and was given the HPV vaccine not too long ago specifically because I'm gay. Not sure about elsewhere but from my experience gay/bi men seem to get vaccines practically thrown at them over here."
582,"It's just a particularly painful vaccine, unless they've changed it in the last 8 years."
583,"I read your post saying that they are thinking of changing the age range to 35, but my question is why was it originally 25? Was the vaccine not effective afterwards in creating immunization or why? "
584,"My doc refused to even consider giving it to me because I was one year older than the recommended time frame when I asked. I'm still mad about it, my history and test results said I hadn't been exposed yet and I think I could have benefited from the protection regardless of my age. "
585,"As a married straight male in his 30s, any benefit to me getting the vaccine now?"
586,Do you know why the booster seems more painful than other vaccines? Just curious.
587,"Are the oncogenic HPV strains only transmitted by sex? Is it then realtivly save to say, that I don't have any of them, since I only had sexual encounters with one girl, that is vaccinated?"
588,"The 'window' keeps getting extended to just below my current age, I can't afford the vaccine on my own, and insurance won't cover it because I'm 'too old' though when the vaccine first be came available, I would have been within the current age window.  It's frustrating, if the vaccine is effective, and you're a sexually active adult, particularly if non-monogamous, you should be able to get the damn vaccine covered by insurance."
589,I tried getting the vaccine at 30 years old as a male. But it was not covered and was $300 a dose. 
590,"Not vaccinating boys has been an incredibly stupid move. I infected two girls with HPV before I knew I had it. I NEVER HAD ANY WARTS.

I am now vaccinated and ask my partners if they are vaccinated against HPV before having sex, but I affected two lives (Or more) because of stupidity."
591,"May I point out that Gardasil doesn't JUST protect against 9 strains. It is merely only *engineered and studied* against those 9 strains. It could very well protect against many other strains as well, we just don't have the time or money to spend on seeing if it prevents strains that oncologists don't care about."
592,Can we omit ugly people since they don't get sex?
593,"This is a bit of an off-handed comment, but since you're the closest thing I'll ever find to an expert on this matter, I figured I'd ask.

I've heard conflicting reports from doctors about whether the strains of HPV which cause genital warts are or are not the same strains that tend to associate with cancer. Similarly, it's unclear what the overlap is between the Garadasil-9 strains and wart-causing strains. 

Do you know of any research that talks about any of these correlations? "
594,[deleted]
595,I was vaccinated with Gardasil a few years back before being sexually active. Would there be any benefit for me asking my doctor about being vaccinated with Gardasil 9 seeing as it's an improvement of the normal Gardasil? 
596,Is it likely that I've received this during standard vaccinations 10-30 years ago? 
597,"I got HPV-related penile cancer, and Denmark wasn't doing and still isn't offering vaccines for boys - nor can I even get it covered as part of our universal healthcare, I have to pay almost 500 bucks. :("
598,How does it benefit gay men? 
599,"Wow what a good name for it, Gardasil-9 protects from 9 strains with 99% coverage from the age 9!"
600,$300 is a lot of money to most parents. That cannot be understated.
601,There are definitely benefits to vaccinating boys. It just took a while to justify the sums in the U.K. health setting when vaccinating all girls plus gay men and trans women (the previous guideline in the U.K.) could also provide reasonable herd immunity.  I am glad it has been expanded though. 
602,"> This has been the standard of care for years now in the US and many Canadian provinces. 

Not in North Texas.  I asked the VA, they said I was too male.  I asked the pharmacy, they said I was too male.  I asked an HIV/STI clinic in the gayborhood, they too, said I was too male.

608,Give us some real sources since you obviously have them!
609,You sure Merck didn't pay you to write this? Great write-up great information. 
610,NP here. This is really great! Thank you for your hard work and especially your willingness to share your findings.
611,Re #4 it's amazing how many people forget about MSM when discussing disease prevention.  Having all males get vaccinated eliminates the stigma/misconcepton that the vaccine is only for women and gay men.
612,We vaccinated my older son before it was recommended for boys. I didn't want my son to pass HPV even if it was thought to only cause cancer in women at the time. I had to ask the doctor he didn't even offer it to male patients at the time. I'm certainly glad that I did now that we know it can cause throat cancer.
613,"Thank you for your post it is informative! Could you give some sources on this? I would like to read a bit more. My parents are very against me getting this, even against my doctor's recommendation. If i could read some good sources on this it might help, and i want to read on this too"
614,Hello I have a question is there a way to learn if you had HPV in the past? And your body just cure it? So you can know if you pass it to someone? Thanks.
615,There's so much misinformation on this topic.  I was instructed the vaccine only worked for girls.
616,"I thought that the chance of getting cervical cancer from HPV was only a 5% chance, and 95% of the time there are no symptoms. That is, even if you get HPV in the first place. So then why push a vaccine for such a low likelihood of it occuring?

617,"> The HPV vaccine is PROVEN SAFE. We have over 10 years of drug trial and postmarket data on it from multiple countries, and side effects are rare and benign. Anaphylaxis is exceedingly rare and on par with the rate of other vaccines.

Your post would be more complete if you’d included information on the lawsuits. Iirc some where dismissed but some were paid out. Death. Epilepsy. Permanent life altering changes that I wouldn’t call benign. 

Your choice to leave it out seems fishy. 🐠 🐟 🐟

622,"The problem is that there is no test for HPV in men. In women we use Pap smears, but seeing as (the vast majority of) men do not have cervices, you can’t do a Pap smear. "
623,Isnt it like nearly every sexual active person has hpv? 
624,"There are extensive cost-benefit analysis (in the general sense, not exclusively dollars but that plays into it) that goes into testing for preventative care.  What would you do if you knew you had HPV since there is not a treatment?  Your MDs recommendation would be to practice safe sex and use protection but that should be his rec anyways.  You may need more routine screening but I’m not sure that has been demonstrated in the literature as improving outcomes in men like it has in women.  We’ve now added cost and a host of secondary factors with minimal health benefit.

You talk about how we need to do more preventative care and that is true to an extent but you need to understand that there have been issues with unnecessary preventative screenings that add cost, false positives, complications, and added unnecessary burdens to people’s lives.  If a preventative screen doesn’t improve outcomes then it isn’t helpful"
625,Modern medicine is very preventative. It's not cost effective to test every man for hpv considering that there would be no intervention. Why not just be responsible and always practice safe sex?

628,"Right? Why just for boys? I'm a full grown man, do I need this?"
629,head and neck surgeon here. HPV vaccine was not given to males because we didn't know it was related to head and neck cancer. HPV was thought to only cause cervical cancer and that's why it wasn't given to males. 
630,"I know in Ontario it was super expensive to give HPV vaccinations so they opted to target girls first because they were more at-risk than boys. you could always pay out of pocket for your kid's HPV vaccination, though, and now they're offering it to boys too because they can actually afford it."
631,"I think the theory was men would get herd immunity if all the women were vaccinated, and since women were most at risk, as the types of cancers women got from it are potentially worse, as well as being more susceptible to catching it, it seemed more cost effective to just vaccinate the women and rely on herd immunity for the men."
632,"Funny enough, it does discriminate in this case. Strains that are likely to cause cervical cancer in women do not present that threat to men."
633,"They didn't initially know about the other, non-cervical cancers being caused by HPV. That being said, they've known about them now for nearly a decade, and vaccinating men helps with herd immunity, so yeah, it was pretty silly."
634,"I believe it's because it was tested for cervical cancer and it is just assumed, not proven, that it will benefit men with oropharyngeal, penile, etc. AFAIK there isn't any data on that, and I study it."
635,I think because without the vaccines it was much more common in women than men and it was a big contributor to vaginal cancer.
636,Cancer absolutely discriminates.  
637,"The cancers that men get from HPV are very rare. All vaccines have a chance of side effects. It was thought that the benefit men get from the vaccine does not outweigh the side effects. 
The cancers women get from HPV are much more common and therefore the benefits of the vaccine are much more obvious. 
Also, it’s unethical for doctors to recommend a treatment that’s mainly for the benefit of someone else (ie. men getting the vaccine to protect women)"
638,"Because men and women are different physiologically. And that's not cause for discrimination, but rather to make sure the treatments that we give for a person are appropriate to their sex. My mother in law, for instance, died of a heart attack because we only knew of how the symptoms manifest in men. Had we known the differences we could have taken her to a hospital sooner and most likely saved her life. 

In short, until HPV vaccinations were clinically tested on boys, there wasn't a good medical reason to extend the treatment to them.  And to be clear, I support boys receiving them now that the scientific consensus is they are safe. "
639,[removed]
640,">Cancer does not discriminate.

I mean...cervical cancer certainly does."
641,[deleted]
642,"Males don't have a cervix, which is the main area that gets cancer from HPV. Most HPV related cancers require an orifice, so heterosexual men aren't at high risk for HPV related cancers."
643,"Cervical cancer is way more common and way more deadly than penile cancer.

We do not have an infinity amount of vaccines, so we should prioritize the groups that would led to a bigger amount of life-saving vaccines."
644,Neither do actual warts.
645,"Besides the other answers, I'll quote from the article:

> The UK government is considering whether to extend the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination programme to boys after an expert committee found that it was cost effective.

It seems that before they found it wasn't cost effective yet.

Infuriating."

648,"There are different strains, so being vaccinated is still useful even if you have one strain."
649,"I can only speak anecdotally, but a fairly persistent wart on my finger (1.5 years, kept coming back after being ""killed"" several times with over-the-counter wart removers) disappeared within a week after I took my first injection of Gardasil 9. I posted this elsewhere in this thread - my doctor told me the vaccine is specifically not meant to be a cure, but it seems to have helped me when my immune system was not able to defeat it on its own (and I had previously had a few warts earlier in my life). Worth asking your doctor if you are interested."
650,"Vaccines are preventative, so no, it would be unlikely to reduce your symptoms. I am not an expert in that field though so take my words with a grain of salt. "
651,Right?? This thread is a very interesting read for me... I actually got a PhD in Epidemiology and my dissertation was on anal HPV infections/ I also worked in a HPV/HIV lab for 8 years.
652,All under 20s are experts in everything. Didn't you know?
653,Warts are harmless.  You need to worry about cancer causing strains 
654,You likely have HPV genotype 6 or 11
655,I think the cause was rather “insurance wouldn’t cover it” than it not being recommended. Males could get it but it often cost $500-600 out of pocket. 
656,"Not just males, women as well. HPV is the most common STD, if you are sexually active, you probably have it.

The Vaccine protects against cancer causing strains which are much rarer.

Most people get infected with the harmless strains. These strains just cause warts and most of us have it."
657,"> Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a very common STD, with an estimated 80 percent of sexually active people contracting it at some point in their lives; 14 million new infections occur yearly in the United States. About 79 million people — men and women — are thought to have an active HPV infection at any given time.

So yes, that seems to be correct."

660,Was talking about something similar with a friend recently and realized I never got the shots due to being the age where people weren’t sure if it was important for men to have... however turn 27 in a few days and insurance is shit. So now trying to figure how to go from there. Didn’t know that testing had moved far enough to see if men had HPV though.
661,"A condom or gloves for a handjob is a bit ridiculous. Unless the hand is gushing blood, it is not a transmission point for an STD. I'm all for safe sex, but let's not get hysterical. You might as well walk around in a plastic bubble at that point. "
662,[removed]
663,How do you know it came from your throat? You had warts/growths in your mouth? 
664,"And it's definitely not completely harmless for males. Take it from me, I've spent over 7 grand on 2 surgeries this year getting warts removed from my butt. Not a fun experience. I'd take the shots any day"
665,[removed]
666,"Because medical decisions in the UK are based on a scientific analysis of the cost vs benefit, not your feelings. The same cost/benefit analysis (based on Quality Adjusted Life Years) applied to every medical procedure was applied to this vaccine. It was found to be cost-effective to give it to women, but not to men. It was also found that giving it to women would protect most of the population, because most men are heterosexual.

It's no different to how we don't give men breast cancer screenings.

This decision was not a scientific one and was made [purely on the basis of equality](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/726319/JCVI_Statement_on_HPV_vaccination_2018.pdf), so it doesn't belong in /r/science, really."
667,"When the vaccine first came out, it wasn't indicated for boys because the FDA wasn't allowed to approve any medication for 1 patient that did not offer the specific patient benefit, but only benefited other patients. What was known at that time was that it should prevent cervical cancers. Since boys don't have cervixes, they couldn't benefit from the vaccine, so it couldn't be approved for them. It couldn't be approved to prevent boys from spreading HPV to girls that weren't protected. It was only after evidence regarding HPV associated anal and throat cancer (as well as genital warts for Gardasil) in males was available that it could even be considered for approval for boys in the U.S."
668,"It's not just linked with genital/anal cancers, but cancers of the head and neck as well. So it is definitely beneficial to straight men too, especially since they can't be tested and are therefore less likely to find out they have it when warts don't present. If you test positive as a woman, you know to be more diligent with cancer screenings.

My mom passed away about 5 years ago from cancer of the parotid gland (neck). She also had cervical cancer earlier in life but caught it early due to routine screenings. Her oncologist suspected link to HPV in both cases."

671,If you're sexually active yes you might benefit from it. It might not be worth it if you are monogamous and are 100% sure both of you are faithful. 
672,I tried a few years ago.  My doctor wouldn't give it to me because my age/gender didn't meet the FDA recommendation.
673,I’m 27 and wasn’t able to get it when it was free for the girls. Got the same question as you. 
674,"In the US you would be 'off label' because you're outside the FDA approved age range. But some doctors will do that. 

If you're in a long term relationship I wouldn't bother. Your risk of acquiring new types is low. If you're out partying frequently, or if you're gay, consider it. 

PSA: I'm not a doctor, but I worked on the vaccine for the manufacturer. "
675,"I will add that even if you're monogamous, one or both parties may be carriers unknowingly, as the symptoms can be dormant. If it worries you and you can afford it, I'd say get vaccinated rather than stay up at night fretting about it."
676,"Yes, it doesn’t hurt to still get it now. Even if you are monogamous, if one of you has the high risk strain it could help your body immunize itself against tumor development. L"
677,Well no cuz you’re already carrying several strains. 
678,"If there is not a cost to you, yes. "
679,Not unless you are a virgin as most people have the HPV virus once they have had sex

I've been the one to break the news to multiple people that ""yes, you can get an stds through oral"" and ""no, the pull out system is not 100%"" (obviously gay couples don't need to worry about that one though!)"
684,"It also makes no sense because, no matter which way you look at it, vaccinating men as well will stop the spread faster than vaccinating only women. "

689,Sounds like your doctor isnt very up to date on evidence based medicine. 
690,It is offered to men. I offer to every male aged 9-26.
691,How much is it without insurance? I’m 24 in Canada and really want the vaccine but can not afford it. :(
692,"Yes! I’m over the age of 26 and my health insurance wouldn’t cover it. I’m forced to pay for this vaccine out of pocket, and it isn’t cheap."
693,[removed]
694,"I'm very curious. Do you have parents refuse based on false beliefs? How do you approach the topic with a young patient? Do you provide sex ed for your pts only if they or their parents request it; do you schedule a ""sex ed"" visit? "
695,"This fact isn't fun at all, but if it's true I'm getting an appointment with my doctor aqap. "
696,Just in time for the vaccine to come out :D
697,"There may not have been data showing it was effective beyond 5 years back in 2009, but there are now case studies showing no evidence of weakened protection after 10 years. [https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm) 

Keep in mind your CBS article doesn't say ""it's ineffective after 5 years"" it says ""No data showing that it remains effective beyond 5 years"" which are two very different things. That article is almost 10 years old. There have been plenty of studies done on the vaccine between then and now.

Also, like another commenter said, the death rate from cervical cancer is much higher than the death rate from the vaccine -- not to mention all the other unpleasant cancers caused by HPV."

This is in the US."
704,"This is in the UK, only girls get the vaccine currently. As another user said, idea is its cost effective to vaccinate women whilst men benefit from herd immunity. "
705,"HPV vaccines have existed only for a bit over 10 years. In most countries of the world, state-sponsorerd vaccination programs were started shortly after the vaccine was made available. In alot of these countries, girls got precedence over boys as men are a lot less likely to get cancer from HPV than women, most men are simply carriers. HPV is responisble for allmost all forms of cervix cancer (99,7%), and a thorough vaccination program could consequently almost eliminate it. Cervix cancer is the second-most common form of cancer in women and the third most-deadly. 

Only now that it is common for girls to get vaccinated, countries are reviewing the option to also vaccinate boys to further reduce the prevalence and protect boys from rarer forms of cancer and warts. Warts in itself are non-malign, but of course can have a negative impact on quality of life."
706,"Public vaccination schedules and coverage are different in each country and region. You may have gotten it free in school because some Canadian provinces covers it for its students.

That said we're 10+ years in with a pretty good track record.   Had my daughter been the right age 10 years ago I would not have had her get it, but we had no concerns having her vaccinated this year."

724,"It's recommended to get it under the age 26, because most people by then have already been sexually active, and also insurance is more like to cover for it, I could be wrong tho about the insurance part. The vaccine is advertised for kids tho, because it's most effective to be given before they hit puberty."

726,"Unless you've been sexually active, yes. Talk with your doctor about options. Also age may affect if insurance covers it or not, not entirely sure on that tho."
727,"No. Those are mandatory vaccines, as in they're recommended a lot more strongly than these vaccines. When it first came out the HPV vaccines were weakly advertised, barely any info, and also given to girls only (in Finland). Now that we have more information, I hope they become more strongly recommended to patients. You should check if you've been given these vaccines, if not, talk to your doctor about getting them. They can protect you against anal, throat, and penile cancer that develops from the HPV."
728,"It also protects males against anal, penile and throat cancer. HPV doesn't only cause cervical cancer but also other cancers to which males are susceptible to as well."
729,Super nice
730,That's why men who have sex with men and women whom are both at far higher risk than men who don't are prioritized. Since vaccines cost a lot of money the rest benefit from herd immunity instead. 
731,"I will hink you mean CERVICAL cancer, not ovarian cancer.  But HPV can cause other warts/cancers also. Plus you should do your best to protect your partner too. "

The high grade lesion endpoint was required by the FDA for approval. It was built on decades of research establishing the link between HPV and cancer. Zur Hausen got a Nobel prize for that."

746,"The BMJ is the British Medical Journal. This story is from the UK, not the US, and we don't have the same prudish culture around sex that you guys do.

I suspect the reason it's taken a while over here is cost-benefit analysis.

They'll have initially thought ""Why go to the expense of vaccinating every kid in the country if you can just vaccinate half of them?""

""If the main issue with HPV is that it causes cervical cancer, just vaccinate the girls to protect them. The virus should then stop spreading - older boys who were exposed pre-vaccine won't be able to pass it onto younger boys via girls, so younger boys will be protected indirectly.""

And maybe that line of thinking would hold fast in a perfectly heterosexual world where every single girl got vaccinated before she became sexually active.

But in the real world

- gay and bisexual boys exist

- not every country has a HPV vaccination scheme for young women, and British men are likely to come into contact with foreign women at some point in their lives.

- teenage sexual activity isn't as prevalent now as it used to be, but kids can wind up having sex surprisingly young. Getting the jab at 13 doesn't help much if you were exposed to the virus at age 12.

Which means it probably is worth it to vaccinate boys too."
747,Do you approve of forced vaccinations or do you think this should be voluntary?
748,"All of the reading I found said it was of little benefit to males, and also posed some (albeit minor) risks. There seems to be very little discussion on the risks. "

756,My grandpa died of a heart attack half an hour after eating a ham sandwich. I think we can all reasonably ascertain that the ham sandwich was the culprit.
757,Okay.
758,"The fainting episode is called a [Vasovagal Response](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527). It happens to me when I'm stuck with any kind of needle (or thinking too hard about them), getting my eyes dilated at the ophthalmologist, or getting queasy from reading about certain medical procedures. It's basically a reflex. 

It's not unusual for you to get a sore throat after getting any vaccine. It kicks your immune system into gear and there's a possibility of temporary inflammation and fever while your body thinks it has a cold. There's no infection present at all, just a response to a fake one (the vaccine)."
759,"Sorry, people don't want to know the negative effects of getting a vaccine they don't need.   They don't want to know that the us government has paid out billions to people harmed by vaccines over the years.

So yes, everyone SHOULD get it but it hasn’t been the status quo in past years. "

You can try and see if doctors can direct you to a specialist where they can attempt to test you, but it's not guaranteed.

So if you have it, it's possible you have oner or two strains, so it's definitely worth it to get protection against the other strains out there."
776,"Men, like women, can get cancer caused by HPV. They can get anal, penile and throat cancer. And no, it doesn't ""spawn"" in males. Males can get it from females. Females can get it from males. Whatever your sex is, you can be a carrier, and you can also get infected."
777,"There's a lot of reading you can do, if you want to learn more.
  
HPV isn't contagious like the flu, but it is easily spreadable since it's so common. Reason for vaccinating only girls? Probably because the vaccine is expensive, and a lot of other reasons that just aren't good enough to avoid vaccinating boys as well. I don't know about boys getting immunity from mothers. How does it help men? Well HPV can cause the following cancers in men; anal, penile and throat cancers. Women as well can get anal and throat cancer. The vaccines aren't only to prevent cervical cancer but also the other types of cancer as well, but unfortunately they were advertised like that."
778,"the justification for roe v. wade wasn't really about ""body autonomy,"" its about a right to privacy"
779,Boys aren't the ones that spread it. Women and men both spread it and carry it. Both men and women are susceptible to the following cancers caused by HPV; anal and throat cancer. Women can also get cervical cancer and men can get penile cancer.
780,"Men are susceptible to the following cancers caused by HPV; anal, penis and throat. Men aren't only carriers and infectors, but they are susceptible too. Woman are also carriers and infectors. Everyone should get the vaccine to prevent them from spreading HPV, but also to protect them from HPV strains that cause cancer in different parts of the body."
781,"Just tell them that even though you're aware that you might already be infected, that you want to receive protection against the other strains of HPV that are there. Just insist. It's stupid that they refuse your money."
782,And that is exactly why the USA needs single-payer healthcare. Cause patients rarely think about the long term consequences of forgoing preventative measures and insurance companies are often too cheap to cover health when their precious profits are on the line. 
783,"It does, just not 100%. The reason there are multiple vaccines, is because you're being vaccinated against multiple strains of HPV. So even though there is a high chance that you already have some type of HPV, by getting vaccinated you're protecting yourself from the other strains of HPV that can cause cancer as well."
784,"It's not only cervical cancer, but also anal, penis, and throat cancer that HPV can cause."
785,"Because unfortunately, there isn't a reliable method of testing men. Hopefully they'll come up with something soon."
786,"im 30 and never been vaccinated, and i am a male, should i be worried?"
787,"The strains of HPV that cause cancer are transmitted through sex, whether that be oral, vaginal or anal sex. If you have had sex with only vaccinated women, then you should be technically safe. There are also other strains of HPV that only cause warts(not specifically genital warts but also other body areas) but not cancer. To those you are susceptible to. The virus spreads through tiny cuts through skin.
  
However since the HPV virus is so common, there is no guarantee will always be together with a vaccinated female partner. Getting vaccinated will help because it protects you against multiple strains of HPV. So even if you have HPV, it's safe to get protection against that other strains of HPV that are out there."
788,"Protection against different strains of HPV that cause cancer, such as cervical, anal and throat cancer."
789,Wasn't likely to? They usually assume you already have it by then
790,"What symptoms?

The HPV vaccine is aimed at the serotypes that result in changes in the cervix, anally and in the throat, but there are hundreds more that give warts and such, and a few that do cause changes in the cervix but are rare.

Spotty bleeding after intercourse can be normal or it could be a symptom of another sexually transmitted infection, best see a gynecologist instead of asking here."
791,"Because the risks of the shot are real, and the benefits are almost not even seen. There is correlation, not causation of lower rates of cancer in those who get the vaccine. I haven't gotten it, and the doctors that actually do any research of their own do not recommend it."
792,"Gardasil only protects against types 6, 11, 16, and 18. They added 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 in 2014 to make Gardasil 9. If you got Cervarix, that only protects from types 16 and 18. They're focusing on the sexually transmitted ones for obvious reasons."
793,Agreed - it should definitely become a routine vaccine along with the others. There is no need for the stigma of sex to play a role in parents’ decision-making. 
794,I'm pretty sure if you're already infected a vaccine won't help
795,"You can get it, your insurance company won't pay for it. "
796,"Yes, but how effective it is for you will depend greatly on your sexual history since it is most effective prior to sexual debut. However, even if you have infection with some genotypes, you can achieve protection for the other types you may not have yet been exposed to. The latest vaccine, Gardasil 9, covers 9 genotypes so coverage is high.

Something to note, in the US, insurance only covers the vaccine up to age 26. If you need to pay out of pocket and are in the US, Costco has good pricing"
797,"Yes, definitely effective. Studies have shown even 1 dose is protective. I can provide some sources if you need - just attended the ASCCP conference this year (and the international HPV mtgs the previous years) and this is always a hot topic since uptake is poor in the US (relative to countries with universal healthcare) and low-resource countries.

The current recommendation if you want to get vaccinated again is to just get the 3rd dose (with whatever is available - there are 3 types on the market) rather than restart the series"

I can't think of any logical reason why it would have such severe side effects for males but not females.

But that aside, if you plan on sleeping with more than one person through your entire life(as most people will) it seems like a good idea does it not? You have a chance of spreading it as soon as you get to the second person"
822,"None of that is accurate at all, and it's also pretty judgy. 

It can and does cause cancer in men, especially throat cancer, and sometimes penile cancer. 

Having a vaccine does not make you a carrier. It gives you an immunity. This holds true to all vaccines. Did you think we were just creating a bunch of polio typhoid Mary's? 

As for sleeping around, that's a horrible way to decide if vaccinations are a good idea. People have sex. Condoms are ineffective at preventing HPV. If you've had more than 3 sexual partners, you're almost guaranteed to have a strain of HPV. 

Edit. I see that you meant acquiring HPV makes men carriers. Yes, it does. It also causes warts and cancer, and why on God's green earth would you be ok with potentially spreading a cancer causing virus to your female sexual partners even if it had no effect on men?"
823,"If we just assume that it has no ill effects on men, then it's still needed, because only vaccinating girls does not provide herd immunity, and if it has no ill effects on men, they may not realise that they have it, and then it can persist in bi/gay men."
824,"No, HPV is linked to oral, throat, penile, testicular, and anal cancers in men.

Though the link is significantly less strong than the link to cervical cancer in women, which is almost always caused by HPV."
825,It can develop into cancers for men too. 
826,"Sleeping around? 45% of men and 40% of women have it, so after having sex with 2-3 partners unprotected most people would be infected.

https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db280.htm

And first off, it causes more cases of oropharyngeal cancer than cervical, and that can affect both sexes. Second, even if it didn't, why would you not want to prevent men from being carriers?

828,"Well Its a possible cause of throat cancer in men, although rarely."

835,"It can cause anal, throat and penile cancer in males. I think that's a lot of cancers to overlook, and say it's only useful for females..."
836,"Because there's no guarantee that their future sex partner will be STD free, so it's better to vaccinate children early on, since the vaccine is most effective when the patient hasn't participated in any sexual activity. Also since HPV is so common already, I think it only makes more sense to vaccinate that part of the population that has the lowest chance of having it already, and that is children."
837,"Easy way not to get in a car accident? Don't drive. Humans are going to have sex, it's literally in our biology. You can keep living in a fantasy land where abstinence works on any scale that matters (look at the south if you want to find out how effective it is), while the rest of us will live in the real world where people get vaccination for preventable diseases.

839,do you have any eveidence because right now all the evidence points to you being completely wrong 
840,This is an anti-cancer vaccine. You want him to decide if he wants cancer when he is older?
841,"The HPV vaccine was pushed on women as teens by their doctors, but generally not given to men."
842,"I remember reading that it was linked to oral sex, and the hpv virus being easier to transmit from the vagina area that way than from a penis. "
843,"Most people here are saying it may be caused because women have had access to the vaccine for longer, which may be part of it, but this has to do with mouth/throat cancers. HPV in women mostly causes cervical cancer instead of others. "
844,"I'd assume HPV - cunnilingus - throat? More men doing that than women, probably. 

Given that it should work the other way around too, I am very confused."
845,"HPV vaccine has been available for women for over a decade. Back when it first came out, there wasn't actually a way to obtain the vaccine as a person presenting as male -- I know because I was male-presenting at the time and got denied.

Another obstacle is that, at least 10 years ago, there was no test to detect HPV in men (though it can be identified through symptoms, there was recently no such thing as a ""No HPV detected"" result for men), while women could be tested for HPV, at least if it's present in the genital area.

STI testing is way more complex than most people realize. Most STI tests aren't a simple ""detector"" that signals ""Yes"" if present and ""No"" if absent. Rather, the specific type of STI test required depends entirely on the area of the body the infection may be present in. As it happens, HPV affects the vaginal flora in a way that is recognizable and specific to HPV, while it manifests much more latently in men."
846,People tend to get H&N cancer starting in their 30s. So most men/women with H&N cancer have no vaccination.
847,Or simply many more women are vaccinated than men.
848,"Yes, [men are more likely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/behindtheheadlines/news/2017-10-23-men-who-perform-oral-sex-on-women-more-at-risk-of-mouth-and-throat-cancers/) to get HPV from oral sex with women, likely because the cervix is more likely to house HPV than male genitalia is. ."
849,"There are far more straight men in the population than lesbian women. You know, the two groups who primarily eat women out."
850,It could be that women are diagnosed with and treated for precancerous cells prior to them becoming full blown cancer during their yearly pap. Men however aren’t getting checked. 
851,"I expect it's because men (used to) smoke and drink more then women. This increases the risk of throat cancer, especially the combination of the two. "
852,It could be due to the fact that they don't actually test specifically as the article states but more so the location of the cancer. The article specifically linked tobacco being another possible for many of these cases which would explain men have much higher rates.
853,I would guess the vagina is a much better reservoir for viral infection than the penis. 
854,Its because women are more likely to be vaccinated and more likely to have previously been diagnosed as the effects a male suffers vs a woman are much less severe and males were not really tested in the past.
855,Keep in mind that not all sex is heterosexual.
856,"This is orophayngeal cancer, which basically means throat cancer. Women are much more likely to get vaccinated because a lot of people still believe HPV ""only"" causes cervical cancer so boys don't need it (even if that were the case they should get it to make it less likely women contract it but whatever). 

My guess is lots of guys going down on girls with HPV (you would never be able to tell, viruses are exceedingly small and the lesions would be all the way up at her cervix, if you don't know what I'm talking about guys go read about female anatomy. I'm serious, it's not hard, you'll thank me and yourself later. Know the basics) contract it because they are unvaccinated and then get throat cancer "
857,"While this one might be due to public health efforts, it's always fascinating women simply have an increased risk of breast cancer because they have more breast tissue. "
858,Men are more susceptible to cancer in general. It's because testosterone is an immune suppressant. 
859,I believe the discrepancy stems from there being more male tobacco users than female. Tobacco used to be cited as the number one cause of oropharnyngeal cancers but I think HPV is taking over now as smoking is going down in popularity and oral sex is on the rise. 
860,"From guys going down on girls who have it AFAIK - my mom is an Internal Medicine doctor who gave me the vaccine as soon as it was available for men. 

Worst part about HPV for guys is that there is absolutely no way to test for it. Girls get a Pap smear and if they are suspected to have it, actually get a small chunk (like the size of the tip of a pen, but enough to cause real discomfort for a couple days) of their cervix removed to check for abnormal cell growth. 

Guys have no equivalent test. So, if you are a carrier, you may present ZERO symptoms (as most HPV strains typically don't present symptoms on male .. parts) and still be a carrier without knowing it or being able to test for it. 

For this reason alone I think that it should be a compulsory vaccine for men. "
861,"According to this article, it appears that men don’t have any natural defenses for oropharyngeal HPV infection: http://www.philly.com/philly/health/hpv-is-causing-an-oral-cancer-epidemic-in-men-by-outwitting-natural-defenses-20180309.html"
862,It is because society does not care about the health of men. 
863,My father said it was linked with the type of squamous-cell carcinomas that he gets. Any articles on that handy?
864,"My sons pediatrician recommends it for teen boys, my son was given his two doses at age 12"
865,And it’s a risk factor for anal cancer.
866,There is an age limit for Gardasil.
867,The vaccine offers good protection against the strains which have been documented to cause the majority of associated malignancies. 
868,"Good luck, a lot of states still don't have electronic health records but I keep this: [http://www.who.int/ihr/IVC200\_06\_26.pdf?ua=1](http://www.who.int/ihr/IVC200_06_26.pdf?ua=1) with my passport. It's a bit of a pain to get all filled out if you're out of college, a bit older, etc. but worthwhile to have."
869,[removed]
870,How is it sexist to recommend that men receive the same protection as women for a disease that can impact both sexes?
871,Exactly this. I got it when I was a teenager and this is exactly what the doctor told me when I got my shot.
872,"Even if you DO get one of the cancer causing strains, the vaccine should help with suppressing outbreaks, by putting the immune system on high(er) alert for the virus and eliminating released copies before they can cause further damage (and thus cancer).

Not to mention that while this vaccine is engineered to be pointing at cancer-causing strains, it's not as if the non-cancerous strains are entirely unrelated; some collateral coverage against many other strains is likely. It just hasn't been researched because apparently nobody cares about studying whether we already vaccinate against finger warts."
873,Interesting when I asked my doctor about this earlier this year he said at my age (~30) that I’d probably already been exposed and not to bother. I figured going in that reduced cancer risk for a couple hundred bucks seemed like a no brainer... wondering if I should push harder next time.
874,[deleted]
875,[deleted]
876,[deleted]
877,So before i turn 30?
878,"That's not true at all. First of all, it is unlikely that you have been infected with *all* of the strains in the vaccine, so it is likely protective against future exposures. Secondly, there is strong anecdotal evidence of the vaccine helping your immune system clear existing HPV infections and studies are currently underway to quantify this.

And we don't just give the vaccine to young teenagers because we are trying to give it before sexual exposure. That's a benefit, of course, but another very important reason is that teenagers have a more robust immune response to the vaccine. They produce more antibodies. The vaccine actually works better in teenagers than adults.

Your comment is what we get when well-meaning people who took high school biology think they understand an issue, but really don't."
879,My company is developing a therapeutic HPV vaccine to treat existing infection. Check out inovio.com if you're interested to know more.
880,"So, for redditors of any age?"
881,What is you're currently clean as a adult? Would it still be advised to take this vaccine? 
882,"So if you’re not sexually active you’re good?

Asking for myself. "
883,"To preface, I'm not a medical doctor, but my understanding is that there are multiple strands.

So I would argue that, yeah, even if you may have a strain or two, there are many diffrent strains, so you should get it unless you litrally have all... 7-9 strains covered"
884,"Hold on, I know I have HPV (I'm male), but it doesn't bother me. Are you saying that I can't get rid of it with the vaccine?"
885,I had HPV (after only two partners in ten years!) and it almost turned to cancer. Had surgery then the HPV vaccine to prevent it from happening again with another strain. 
886,"Yup. My doctor recommended to my dad that I get the HPV vaccination when I was 9. My dad declined, thinking I would stay an innocent angel. News flash, I wasn't, and got exposed to it. I didnt get infected, but I damn well could have."
887,"Blatantly false. You are given immunization against the strains you haven't contracted. Even if exposed to one strain, you can still be exposed to other strains. "
888,"Have you ever had warts *anywhere* on your body, including genital warts? If so, you have / had some form of HPV. That's the only way to identify it since there's no blood test to confirm. The vaccine, which typically comes in 3 parts over time, will protect you from several but not all strands of HPV. So even if you do have HPV dormant somewhere, the vaccine could protect you from other strains. Some cases of HPV typically resolve themselves and go away on their own, or sometimes it's just laying dormant in the body until one day a wart pops up. The research is still limited but ongoing. "
889,"Maybe. It's not well researched. If you have the extra cash, and can talk to an MD about it that will prescribe it, it shouldn't hurt. 

There is a lot of evidence that it's **super** transmissible though, so two things about that - you almost assuredly have SOME type of HPV in you (150+ strains, many of which you get non-sexually), and even the ""sexually transmitted"" variety seems to be able to move around without sexual contact. "
890,"Checking with your doctor can't hurt. From what I've heard others say they will likely say no to giving you it, but if you push and pay out of pocket (insurance likely won't cover it) they may be convinced.

"
891,"If you want to get the vaccine, just tell the doctors you are still a virgin, but are planning to have sex with your new girlfriend and would like the vaccination.

Most HPV infections are asymptomatic, so you wouldn't know whether you have had an infection, but it's highly unlikely that you've already been infected by all the different strains of the vaccine. 



There's no reason for the adviced ages but using it as a proxy for sexual activity. Thus if you are 40 and had sex with just two women/men it's highly unlikely that you are already infected. Thus the vaccine would still protect both you and your future partners."
892,I would definitely ask about it with your primary care provider. 
893,"The problem is that the HPV strain that causes warts is different from the strain that causes cancer. You may have never had warts, but you could easily be a carrier for strains 16 or 18, for example, which are the most dangerous cancer-causing ones. HPV is NOT detectable in men if there are no symptoms, as you cannot really test for it. Not yet, anyway.

I'm a female in my late 20s. I got the HPV vaccine when I was about 14, I have been careful with sex partners and have also not had that many to begin with, yet I STILL got one of the dangerous strains that has no symptoms (found out just this year after my most recent pap). I have no idea which guy I got it from because, again, they were all ""clean"" at the time I had contact with them, and any of them could have easily been carriers.

I would definitely talk to a doctor and see if getting the vaccine at 33 would be helpful. It could be worth it for you, but it depends. Something I was never told was that the vaccine DOES have a period of effectiveness that is usually only about 10 years, so people who get it at young ages (like I did) can STILL get the dangerous strains of HPV later on if they never got booster shots. Sadly, that's exactly what happened. It's quite a complex issue."
894,You will have a lot of difficulty finding a doctor or nurse willing to give you the HPV vaccine now because you are too old for the standard recommendation. Sorry.
895,Unfortunately the vaccine is only approved to age 26
896,You could go to Walgreens and lie about your age. Like $200 a pop though 
897,"Well it's not just for you,  but reduces risk for any woman you may sleep with,  if you're into that. "
898,had a similar question. Will they even give me an HPV shoot? (28 years old)
899,"Two things to keep in mind. Some forms of HPV can remain dormant for years. I have it, will be removing my cervix because mine is cancerous, but it didn't show up on a test/pap smear for possibly ten years according to my gyno. So that means I contracted it before my husband and I started dating. My husband is 32 and was told at 16 that he didn't need to get the vaccine because most men don't show any symptoms, there is no way to test men for it, unless they have a legion or wart, and it typically runs it's course in men and doesn't cause too many issues. So he never had the vaccine. But the damn thing is called the HUMAN papaloma virus. Get the vaccine to protect yourself for any future partners, but if you've had it, you may not have known anyway. I also wasn't vaccinated for it as a teen because my stepmom worked in a doctor's office and her boss (a virologist) told her to not give it to me because the side effects were very severe and a lot of girls had become disabled or died from the vaccine. I was 12 when it came out. I got it when I went to college at 18, but it didn't protect me because I must have a different strain than what was in the shot."
900,Same situation. I was told I was too old for the vaccine
901,"What about trans women? Didn't hear anything about this until after presenting female, when I was given my shots ASAP without them knowing of my medical history other than ""I did not get this vaccine yet and I'm 24 years old"""
902,"Serious question... why (how) do you have so little sex?

I had more sex than this last week and am the same age."
903,">I have no reason to believe that it wouldn't be true for men

I don't have any numbers in front of me, but it's not safe to assume that the clearance numbers are the same for men and women. Men are typically more susceptible to infections because testosterone is an immune suppressant."
904,"Same. Had rectal warts in 2010 from my 2nd ever partner. After surgery my doctor recommended I get the vaccine (I had to pay out of pocket).

There are a couple dozen strains or something, and only a few cause warts or cancer--and those are the ones targeted by the vaccine. I had one, but it would still protect me from the others.

Also, my doctor said that there wasn't conclusive evidence at the time, but it's possible that the vaccine would reduce symptoms and help clear the strain I currently had. Never had another outbreak, so maybe it made a difference.

They use age as a proxy for sexual history. If you haven't had a lot of partners even if you're over the recommended age your doctor may think it's a good idea."
905,So would you recommend a 26 y/o male try to get the vaccine? 
906,"But not approved by the FDA until September ~~2017~~ 2009.

914,Yup got my vaccine also I live in NJ. 
915,I remember getting the vaccine 9-10 years ago. My sister around the same age as me was going in to get it so my mom decided to get it for me too. Wasn’t super popular to do back then but I’m very glad I had it done. 
916,"I’m not sure if it is in Canada though.  I could be wrong, I’m 30 now and don’t remember getting vaccinated for this, even though we did have HPV awareness campaigns in high school."

Merck is the company. $450 for every child in the country-- not a bad deal, eh?

I am one of those parents. I'm not antivax, but I am skeptical of novel vaccines. My children are young enough that we can wait for the millions of other children to be guinea pigs awhile longer.

If there are strange side effects, it's very likely those will be noted soon, in other words in just a few years I will be ready to have this administered to my children.

> To some conservative minded parents, offering their kid a vaccine against an STD = condoning premarital sex.

It also protects them if their future spouse wasn't quite so chaste, doesn't it? 

It potentially protects them if they're a victim of rape too.

It protects them if, like most other people, they have premarital sex. I don't see how punishing them with *cancer* is proportionate to this. That said, I don't consider it a sin either (I'm an atheist after all), so no punishment is warranted. Well, other than the regret of poor choices."
946,"Unfortunately, any form of vaccination is a hard sell to some conservative parents"

949,"I'm not sure how widespread it was, when I was a bit younger and still needing physicals for school, the doctors recommended against anyone getting that vaccine due to it being too new at that time. I honestly don't know if that was just a single clinic or widespread, but that could also be a reason why it's not standard. "
950,"No and no.

If you've not been sexually active the vaccine is useful at any age.

984,"I was lucky. My doctor recommended I get it and I was about to turn 26 which is when it stops being covered. My second and third doses where after my birthday but because the first was still covered, I didn't pay anything for it.

985,We don't really know if it's at all effective against existing infection. But we do know it would give you protection from future infections of other strains. There are many strains.

986,"Based on some quick googling, I found this:

The vast majority don't cause many issues. The ones that tend to cause cancer are mostly covered in the vaccine. There are over 100 strains of HPV. The vaccine concerns 9 of these. 

So while it's true, it shouldn't discourage sexualy active individuals from getting protection. If you're sexualy actuve, you likely have HPV, but it isn't nessisarly likely that you even have any of the 9 strains that we vaccinate against or that really cause problems.

The statistic that is actually important is as to how many have one of the 13 types that cause cancer. The other ones are... statistically misleading

Tl;dr: Get vaccinated regardless of sexual activity levels"

995,"Very salient points, I don't have a good argument other than I would just like to know my health status as completely as possible.  But that's just me, I like metrics.   But I understand that ultimately it may cause more problems than it fixes.  I just wish that didn't have to be the case. 

The only comment I have is something I heard from my care provider almost word for word, and that is about 'routine screening not improving outcomes'.  Obviously getting tested isn't going to improve my health.  But it's a peace of mind thing.  If someone asks me if I'm clean, I can say ""Yes, I've been tested recently"", not ""I don't have any symptoms, but I've slept with dozens of people and I'm not certain"".  And yes, in theory we're all practicing safe sex anyways, but sometimes things go wrong, and I would feel much better if a condom broke with someone who I know has been tested, and who is on birth control.  Personally, I would be happy to pay a little extra for routine testing just for that peace of mind.  "

IMHO, this shouldn't necessarily be viewed as government simply being cheap. Depending on how much money is available, vaccinating half as many people might have made the difference between being able to start a vaccination program or not being able to do it at all.

Decisions should be judged based on what the actual alternatives are, not what we think they ought to be. Being able to start a vaccination program with half the people is a better option than not doing it at all. If it proves effective (as I believe it did), that will generate political support for going the rest of the way. And there is always the possibility that (as seems to have happened here), it will get cheaper, so that it's easier to include everybody anyway."

1016,">Because men and women are different physiologically.

And thats totally valid if there actually is a physiological difference. But there's not in this case. Men obviously won't get cervical cancer, but HPV can still cause cancer of the penis, anus, tongue, and throat. If someone contracts HPV, it takes the body a couple of years to build up the antibodies and eliminate the virus. That's a long time for a carcinogen to act on your body. Better off getting vaccinated so that you can't really contract it in the first place."
1017,">The policy makers who decided who gets the vaccine were incredibly sexist and in many respects should be held accountable for their decision.

Gardasil was originally tested and approved by the FDA for effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer. It would have made no sense to for boys to take on the potential health risk of a relatively untested vaccine and financial cost for something that had no proven benefit for them. As soon as clinical trials showed that there WAS a benefit for boys (in terms of preventing genital warts), the recommendations quickly expanded to include boys.

Also, there are plenty of underfunded cancers, but prostate cancer certainly isn't one of them. It's the second most highly funded cancer in the US (behind only breast cancer - which kills more people annually than prostate cancer does). "
1018,">	women do tend to get the better deal when it comes to health services and disease/cancer research money and funding.

With a few exceptions like breast cancer and HPV, that’s not true at all, it’s the opposite. For a very long time women weren’t even included in medical trials. That’s why, to this day, women are much more likely to have adverse reaction to drugs, and less likely to be cured, and much less is known about female anatomy than male anatomy. Women are often under-diagnosed with certain diseases and disorders because they’re more likely to get different symptoms. Women get heart attacks later than men because of protective effects of estrogen, but they’re more likely to die from them than men because the “textbook symptoms” are all based on men, and because women’s pain and symptoms are much more likely to be dismissed by doctors - a huge problem with many other diseases.

A lot of money in women’s healthcare goes to pregnany and childbirth-related care and issues,  which men have no equivalent of, so it’s not unfair. But the main focus of it is the baby, women’s health only receiving attention when their life is threatened or there’s harm to the baby, otherwise nobody cares much. Just compare the amount of care and money that goes into women’s prenatal care (when it’s her and the baby) and postnatal care (when it’s just her). Various health issues women can experience during pregnancy and postpartum often receive very little attention so long as they don’t harm the baby.

And don’t even get me started on menstrual issues, other common problems like yeast infections ans UTIs, menopause or sexual dysfunction. For some reason society has accepted that it’s normal for women to spend ~60% of their lives in a state of pain, discomfort and diminished quality of life. Meanwhile, whenever there’s something wrong with a man’s reproductive organs or his hormones, he usually gets treatment right away."
1019,Because women are at a much higher risk than men in this case. And trying to compare something like breast cancer to prostate cancer is ridiculous. Breast cancer is vicious and kill young women unlike prostate cancer which most diagnoses are in men who die from old age before the cancer can truly affect them. 
1020,">Just look at prostate cancer vs breast or cervical cancer and the disproportionate research funds despite similar deaths and occurrences.

Why does everyone always bring up funding for prostate cancer? Prostate cancer gets more funding in the US than any other cancer besides breast (which kills more people annually and tends to kill people younger). "

The virus is spread by skin-to-skin contact. Homosexuals can spread this to one another, and technically, you don’t need penetration of any sort to give it or contract it. All men do not have it, but research has shown that most people do have it.

Now unfortunately I don't have a marketing department and PR firm strong enough to sell my ideas.    So guess which one wins...

It boils down to this; after this much time of the vaccine on the market, no one can point to a systematic review (or even a relatively large double-blind trial) that actually shows efficacy on prevention of cervical cancer.    With the amount of money on the line here, you would think Merck would put every single penny they have into proving this once and parading the study around town.    Yet, the complete absence of such evidence doesn't phase anyone.

I can't help but wonder if the proving of certain modern vaccinations like Gardasil isn't greased a bit with the almighty dollar.

And I also wonder if it isn't shielded from questioning by the universal (and rightly so) hatred for the antivaxxing movement.

I have done some work on data for MERCK and I know they incentivize health providers to give gardasil to every single person who is eligible to have gardasil."

There are many, many strains of HPV and exposure to one doesn't necessarily confer immunity to another. The vaccine manufacturers target the strains linked to the most problems first. Two strains in particular cause most hpv related cancers. Another two strains cause the most visible warts. The first Gardisil protects against those four. The other 7 are linked to problems too. 

You might still get it covered by insurance at your doctor's. If not, you can get it at a pharmacy or a travel vaccine center (or ask your doctor for it). It's pricy, but it's really worth it. It'll be two shots a month apart and then a third shot 6 months later. "

1249,Women are at far greater risk of cancer caused by HPV than men.  That's why the priority for vaccination has been women. 
1250,"You can obviously buy it yourself if you want, you knew that right?"
1251,"That's not how it works at all.

If you think *exactly* the same question of the modelling wasn't asked in the US you're out of your mind. The reason to limit it was based on the science, they've had to really hammer and stretch the model to make this fit."
1252,"This is for preventative measures, not treatment. When it comes to _prevention_ it is entirely a cost/benefit analysis.

If you don't like it just get private healthcare. It's cheaper to do that in the UK than in the US too. So I have both national healthcare which covers nearly everything I'll ever need, and private healthcare because my employer decided to give it to me for some reason. 

"
1253,"As apposed to- oh you got cancer? Best go broke trying to save yourself.

Youick to your healthcare system.

"
1254,"Right, because ""this might have saved you, but you can't afford it as a person""  is much better. Also there's nothing to stop someone getting the vaccine privately in the UK."
1255,"Guys, don't feed the troll.  "
1256,"You know we have private health insurance and private hospitals here too, right? You could pay for it if you wanted, just like in the states. Only difference is no major crippling healthcare costs and bankruptcies. 

Also tell me more about how insurance companies have no limitations on their coverage and no one in America has ever missed out on healthcare for financial reasons."
1257,How dare you! NHS is as English as mom and shepherd's pie.  
1258,Saved you from what? They already gave it to women for cervical cancer risk. Men don't see significant issues from HPV.
1259,"Women have had the HPV vaccine as standard fare for at least a decade in the UK. At this point it is pretty much covering all women who can be covered; either you were too old for it to be likely useful for you, or you went through school and somehow avoided it when it should've been provided."
1260,"It's 2018, you can just call them traitors."
1261,"Just because you can’t get the disease doesn’t mean you can’t get the virus associated with that disease and spread it to others (females) who can develop the disease. 

For more info on this particular vaccine read u/intensive comment. "

If this is a serious question...

Boys still have penises, throats, anuses, and tongues. On which one of those body parts do you think boys would like to contract cancer?"

1264,That analogy has a serious flaw because who doesn’t want trampolines everywhere? 
1265,That makes no sense. If there were a reliable technology that could prevent anyone from plummeting to their death from a building then every tall building should definitely have it.
1266,"I feel like... that's more arguing against putting walls around the observation floors of a building, which every building with an open air observation deck has.  "
1267,"That would be true, as giving the vaccine earlier would be more likely to give immunity before your son is exposed to it.  It is a useful argument as you say, but as long as you get vaccines including boosters before exposure to the disease there is no benefit to getting them early.  In fact, the immunity from most vaccines fades over time, such that in the UK women are being given boosters for pertussis (whooping cough) when pregnant."
1268,"The vaccine is actually hardly effective if administered in the early 20s onward. The younger it can be administered, the better. "
1269,"How long has this vaccine been out?

I would say half of my friends have HPV. We are in our mid 30s. 

I've got a 10 year old boy and his pediatrician never mentioned the vaccine to us. I'll have to bring it up to him the next go round."

1273,"Still, they'd argue that she wouldn't need it until she's marriage age so why give it to her now when she's a teenager?"
1274,That's what my mom had to tell my grandma after she threw a fit over getting me vaccinated.
1275,"What do you mean ""framed""? I know a woman who died that way. Contracted the virus from her husband and got cervical cancer. They were both pretty conservative people. "
1276,They'll counter with something about dressing appropriately or something.

1281,"Not true at all. It's most white hippies and black Americans that don't get vaccinations, although for different reasons. "
1282,"Not all HPV strains are sexually transmitted (like your common wart), but the ones relevant to this discussion are. The HPV vaccine protects against the strains that are high risk for causing cancer and genital warts. The vaccine does not target the strains responsible for common warts."

1289,Ah okay I always wondered this when I heard about HPV vaccines for a long time now. I even asked a nurse and she had no clue. I'm glad to finally know why. Thanks a lot!!!!
1290,"We are. However, prior to marriage I had various partners. However, never (to my knowledge) contracted anything."
1291,"Interesting. Do you think that can hold up if multiple people report the same difference in pain relative to different injections administered by the same nurses?

By that I mean that my sister and I both had the same opinion on the booster, but we've always gotten shots from the same nurses at the pediatrician's office. Maybe something like viscosity can affect their technique for this particular vaccine?"
1292,"They do let you get it. I chose not to since I’m not a “high risk” person. I have a female partner who I am in a monogamous relationship with. If you are hitting tinder and such, I would suggest that you get it. 

You’re right. Staying healthy is NOT cheap. :("

I don't know what I was expecting, but given that it's only given to females I was expecting something hormone related to be a reason behind why it's taken so long to be recommended for males. Y'know, it somehow inhibits testosterone production or boosts estrogen or whatever. Nevermind ;)"
1297,"I don't understand why this has to be a big hang-up. Does the doc have to talk about sex? I don't recall my pediatrician going into detail with my kids about how to contract hepatitis, diptheria or rubella before getting those vaccines. I mean, I'm all for having open and transparent conversations with my kids about sex, but when they got the Gardasil it was just another one of those vaccines that would protect against disease."
1298,It was one of those rare parenting moments where you get to be 100% right.
1299,"Thank you so much! I am reading through them now, this is great information.

One reason that they had was that there are only a few thousand cases per year so I am not really at great risk. They are also very Christian and saying I wont need it unless I am super promiscuous. :'D 

So they are pretty against me ever getting it."

True. And if the lawsuits had been dismissed, I’d be less worried. If there’s nothing to worry about then why’d they pay out on so many of the lawsuits?

This kind of self victimization is very annoying and reflects poorly on the cause. "

1314,I meant why just boys and not boys and men. Of course women already get it.
1315,Call your doctor and ask if you can get the rest of your shots and stuff. Then do. 
1316,"NP here! I’ve spoken with the drug representative for the company that makes the vaccines and have done my own digging into this as well. There is no maximum time limit between vaccinations (meaning you wouldn’t have to start the series over again). 

BUT the vaccine works best and you build your best immunity while you’re younger....get that 3rd shot ASAP!"
1317,"They did an economic analysis when this decision was made and the quality adjusted life year was just below the threshold to be deemed worth while. Same, but less extreme reason for why we don’t vaccinate everyone in America against Ebola. "
1318,In Quebec at least if you tell them you are a man who has sex with men it's free. They don't even ask for video evidence. Adult woman on the other hand need to pay $200 for each of the three shots.
1319,"Yeah, its kind of sad that there was a big push to get all young girls vaccinated a few years ago, rather than all young people."
1320,"But when i went to the clinic (gay) at 19 they gave me the option for it so I took it. So really everybody who’s gone to the clinic has had the opportunity to have the vaccine.

1324,"I should've clarified that it is more common to have some type of symptom in women, one being vaginal cancer."
1325,"I’m not wrong. 

Penile cancer is very rare. So is anal cancer. Throat cancer is more common but was attributed to tobacco and not HPV. My point is there’s no conspiracy to prevent boys from getting the vaccine. At the time the vaccine came out, the risks of the vaccine seemed worse than the disease it was preventing. New evidence has come showing that HPV is a problem for men also so now boys get the vaccine. 

3000-4000 women a year die from cervical cancer. How many men die from penile cancer?"
1326,"I agree with you, but you're getting hung up in the wrong place. I fully support the use of vaccines (or any medical treatment for that matter) once it has been tested. It wasn't tested and approved for boys yet doctors were giving it to them for years. That's problematic. "
1327,"Where I come from there are more deaths caused by prostate cancer among men than breast cancer among women and prostate cancer receives less funding.
The hpv vaccine prevents transmission and also the cancers caused by the virus. For many years after the vaccine was deemed safe and effective it was still only given to the female population. Rates of cervical and oral cancers in women are predicted to drop off in the years ahead compared with increases of cancers caused by the virus in men.
I understand there is going to be a lag when something like this is being partially trialed but it has taken far too long to fill the gap.
"
1328,Can you provide me with some links to see this? I'd like to read more and have some data to look to to justify changing my opinion if you are indeed correct.
1329,"Which is also very small compared to cervical cancer.

If you look at the lead causes of cancer death in places where there’s not a good vaccine coverage you will se cervical cancer at the top 3 in women. Its is way more common than any of those types of cancer in men added.

And again, in a place where everyone has acess to the vaccine everyone should be targeted. In places where its not we should prioritize the most needed group: sexually active or soon to be woman."
1330,"Exactly, I also want to know, if your body has the strength to get rid of previously 4-5 warts due to a very healthy lifestyle and stress reduction to actually get rid of HPV completly or not have any outbreaks anymore?   


I've read from several people that once they got clear because their own body managed to fight it off they never got it again, whilst some report that they got treated externally (doctor: laser, iceing) and the warts (for example) came back stronger and in a higher number."
1331,Do I get you right? You have HPV and got 1 vaccine shot and it got worse? 
1332,"Correct - types 6 & 11 can cause warts but not cancer. They are the only types that are really considered symptomatic, whereas the carcinogenic types cause changes at a cellular level that need biopsies to diagnose (unless it is more advanced and is then visible)"
1333,"Yes. It’s very rare.  Penile cancer is rare. Anal cancer is relatively common. Oral cancer is super common

Anal cancer is common gays — you can be tested for HPV in anal 

Oral cancer is common people who eat genetials — you can be tested as well for HPV in oral

1338,"The risk is not just low, it's negligible. You would need to have a cut on your hand for the virus to enter, in which case you shouldn't be giving handjobs anyway. I would rather not get a handjob at all than wear a condom, that's just silly. If they want to wear a glove, I guess that's their business, but I still think it's overkill, and I'm perfectly happy finishing myself off if they're that worried about it. It's the same reason I don't wear a mask around during flu season or wipe off door handles with wet wipes or purell every time I shake someone's hand or bring my own keyboard to the computer lab or refuse to pet the cat or never go in the woods or just avoid leaving the house altogether. You can get diseases from all of those things, but constant fear of statistically negligible disease vectors is no way to live your life. 

>if someone asks you to use a barrier method, there’s probably a good reason for it

That's a good point- if I get the impression that someone believes they're going to give me an STD, I probably just won't have sex with them.

The vaccine was initially only proven to be effective for preventing cervical cancer. Males don't have a cervix.

Doctors are charged with the medical care of their patients, they must weigh the risks and benefit to the patient of any procedure performed on the patient.

To bring the risk or benefit to someone else into this analysis is not just evil, but also illegal."
1340,"I had symptoms for a long time before I got it checked out due to embarrassment and thinking it was just hemorrhoids or something. Finally in March of 2017 I went to a doctor and found out I had warts. Got referred to a dermatologist, saw him for 8 months, getting chryo treatment every 3-4 weeks. They'd shrink and come back in that time frame. Finally they referred me to a colorectal surgeon. The issue was on the inside as well so the dermatologist wasn't getting all of it. The colorectal surgeon suggested surgery, and I had that in March of this year. The issue got much better but at my 1-month post OP the issue was already coming back so I had a second surgery in may of 2017. I had my post op in June and got the all-clear. I go back in September to make sure I'm still wart-free. The surgery itself isn't bad, they knocked me out with ketamine. The recovery from the first one was pretty rough though, because my case was so severe. I bled and had pain for about 2 weeks. The recovery from the much less serious second surgery was much less painful. My suggestion would be to get the surgery and get it over with. I'm very happy it's behind me and I really hope it's something I never have to deal with again

* to answer your question, yes the virus is permanent, but if you can get ahead of it with surgery then your body should be able to handle it yourself. The doctor told me that your body recognizes it as a threat and gets better at fighting over time, once the surgery has helped you get ahead of the curve"
1341,"I can't answer your questions or relate exactly to u/thaolehamsta, but I'm a male in my early 20s in Canada and only just a few months ago got my first shot of Gardasil 9. My warts were uncommon and thankfully only came on my hands, but were fairly persistent. After taking the first shot of the vaccine, the wart disappeared within a week. My doctor told me the vaccine is not meant to act as a cure, but it might be worth asking your doctor if you should try it out."
1342, There are many ways to get HPV. You don't have to have sex.

No, there is currently no approved test for HPV in men.

>Routine testing (also called ‘screening’) to check for HPV or HPV-related disease before there are signs or symptom, is not recommended by the CDC for anal, penile, or throat cancers in men in the United States. However, some healthcare providers do offer anal Pap tests to men who may be at increased risk for anal cancer, including men with HIV or men who receive anal sex. If you have symptoms and are concerned about cancer, please see a healthcare provider.

1351,"There are anal pap tests but they are not recommended unless you are gay, bi or HIV positive. 

Usually also they test cancer tumor tissue/epithelial cells to see if they detect HPV-DNA in them (relevant solid tumors in genital regions) and thats how they find out.  But it needs to go to the stage of cancer (tumors) before they do these tests. 

Most hpv infections do clear out on their own, there is no way to know which people will develop cancer if they have hpv. Some do not. "
1352,Warts....lots of em

At some point in college, maybe 2008.  Then after college around 2011 and again in 2013 (after contracting HPV).  I was too old to be covered by insurance each time.

The policies were constantly improving so I went back after each publicized change, but I was always just outside the covered ages."
1355,"Well of course. We go over every possible reaction a client has had in the past to make sure it doesn't happen with future treatment (or at least this should be the standard). I only said there are risks for every medication because, well there are. People should always look into the risks of whatever medications they use including over the counter medications such as Tylenol. 

People tend to see risks for vaccines and write vaccines off completely but still take high doses of Tylenol everyday without consulting a medical professional. 

(I am just using Tylenol as an example as it is a common over the counter medication, and I am not saying OP is writing off vaccines or such)  "
1356,"Absolutely. However above isn't exactly the most common reaction. I was just saying any medication has risks, I mean people have seizures from taking Tylenol. 

The only reason I said all medications have risks is because quite a few people tend to write off all vaccines because people have had bad reactions, when that goes for every medication. "

1358,[deleted]
1359,Did you get compensated?
1360,"Sorry. If you've had sex, the effectiveness of the vaccine wouldn't be as guaranteed, because it's possible that you already have contracted HPV. However, if you can get vaccinated, do it anyway because the vaccines as whole provide protection against multiple strains of HPV. In other words, if you've been sexually active, there's a high chance you've contracted some strain of HPV, but taking the vaccines will hopefully help prevent you from contracting other strains as well."

1364,"It could. But wouldn't you rather get this 1 time easy vaccine as a back up to protect you for decades? Ideally people would use a barrier method every time they have sex, but HPV can be passed through oral, vaginal, and anal sex. People aren't perfect and will not use a condom/dental dam every time, so the HPV vaccine offers another layer of protection."

How can you be so willing to hurt the others around you?"

Every single one of these docs seemed to only half heartedly offer it, and I didn’t even have to finish my ‘No th-..’ before they waved their hands, shook their heads yes and basically gave a ‘say no more fam’ Two of these docs/nurses also stated they’ve not vaccinated their own kids with it either. I don’t know how to put it into words to explain, but their tone/body language/responses all pointed to them fully understanding my concerns without me even voicing them.

Take a look at which articles interest you the most, and if it seems too complicated, read at least the intros, abstracts and conclusions on them. There is so much more information out there but unfortunately the majority of them are behind a paywall. Also if you have any questions about any of the things I linked, ask away, and I will do my best to help. Also I do apologise if the articles I linked are too complicated, and if something really interests you, but you don’t understand it, ask and I will do my best to simplify it. And if you want more simplified sources, or more specific topics, ask as well, and I’ll see what I can do. I don’t know everything, and I haven’t read all the articles fully, just read briefly on them before listing them. I do have some background in chem and bio, so these scientific stuff aren’t something new to me, so please ask away. And if something else besides HPV interests you, again , do ask. I hope you get to learn something new, and I hope you get better!

Brief info on HPV strains
"
1390,"That is up to your physician. 
FDA approval and the definition of standard of care (used in malpractice) are not the same thing. "
1391,"There were some rare cases of severe side effects when Gardasil was first released - but I believe it was blown out of proportion by the news because it was a newer vaccine. 

"
1392,"There have been a handful of deaths *potentially* associated with the vaccine but given the tens of millions of doses given you are much more likely to die of preventable cancer. 

Doctors can sometimes be funny, they might not vaccinate due to potential safety concerns yet they drive their child around while talking on the phone. No one ever pays attention in statistics except statisticians."
1393,You can still get it up until mid-20’s I believe. 
1394,This is a thread literally about a link to research on the subject. 
1395,Because there's science behind it. Opioids work as well. 
1396,You can't be a real person. I refuse to believe the logic in anyone's head actually works this way. 
1397,"Must be a nice bubble to be living in to believe it doesn't happen often.. Also even if it's consensual and you use barrier methods you still risk the condom/dental dam breaking.

At the end of the day preventative care is better than curative care. "
1398,"Why would I take an antiemetic for that? You'll hug a girl one day, keep your chins up 😊"
1399,"Men can get the virus, but it doesn't cause cancer iirc. "
1400,[removed]
1401,"Because even though the most common way pf contract HPV is by participating in sexual activities, it's possible, albeit not as common, to contract HPV from kissing, and it's also possible to contract HPV from the mother through birth (this is more rare). Why is it so bad to vaccinate someone against a virus that is so prevalent in our societies, even if they may never participate in acts that make them susceptible to the virus? 
  
When the kids are getting vaccinated, doctors aren't thinking, oh this kid's gonna have sex soon so better protect them against  STDs. They're thinking instead, we have a vaccine that can prevent cancer in individuals from one of these very common and very prevalent viruses in our society. 
  
Isn't better to be protected than hoping that your kid never kisses, or has sex? What sorta of parent puts that sort of burden on their kid? 
  
Imagine the moment they're of age, and you tell them, sorry kid, you can't have sex or kiss anybody cuz I thought it was better that doctors don't vaccinate you against this super common virus that almost everybody has because I thought it would be unfair to assume that all kids have sex.
  
You realise that the point you're making is not the point of the vaccine! The point of the vaccine is that scientists have come up with a way to reduce risks of a very common cancer! Which is amazing, and I think you're just fighting against survivability by refusing them.
  
Also I don't understand how circumcision is related to HPV... explain?"
1402,so you want me to believe anecdotal evidence from random people on youtube with no education in medicine over studies upon studies from real experts with degrees? 
1403,The shots are free if you state you're gay haha. Works here in Alberta at least.
1404,"I was just a little older than the cutoff age so didn't get it for free (I'm female). Currently 29 and have luckily not been exposed to HPV. My first year with health insurance so I'm getting it done, but it's a whopping $660 for all three doses before insurance. It's incredible how much this costs, it's inaccessible to most people. "
1405,Shots are free for anyone under 25 in ON now. Just waiting to get my second dose!
1406,its still around 300-400$ here in canada unless your gay or had gay sex recently then you get it free as a male.
1407,I thought Trudeau was all for gender equality though? Does boys getting HPV associated cancer not something that we are concerned about in Current year?
1408,fortunately i had insurance at the time that covered most of them.
1409,"Women's health vs men's health isn't always the best way to put it. It's not always clear if risk factors are influenced by biological sex vs hormones vs anything else, but there's so much variability within genders and overlap between. 

Biological/birth sex is useful to categorize most people in a population, but it's far from a complete model (intersex, or people who transition/change their gender presentation)"
1410,"The shift should be seen in infection rates, which weren't able to be measured in men until recently.

Realistically it's dumb not to vaccinate men too as they're transmitting it--as the majority of humans are only having male/female sex, and limited amounts of that, vaccinating both genders severely limits the spread compared to only vaccinating one."
1411,"Australia has had resounding success, there is even talk of eradicating cervical cancer.

[Australia could become first country to eradicate cervical cancer](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/04/australia-could-become-first-country-to-eradicate-cervical-cancer) - ""Australia could become the first country to eradicate cervical cancer, according to an announcement from the International Papillomavirus Society.

New research, published on Sunday, reveals that Australia’s free HPV vaccine program in schools has led to a dramatic decline in future cervical cancer rates."""
1412,"It's not just cancer that is a concern, developing complications that lead to infertility takes significantly less time "
1413,"St Peter: Looks like you died of throat cancer... so a smoker eh?

merpes: Um... look on page 17 though 48

St Peter: *turns beet red*  mumbling um.. go in.
"
1414,"I have been having sex including oral sex with my current wife who I unkowly infected as a Dr lied to me.  But I give her oral for the last 15 years and I don't have mouth cancer.  

HPV causes cervical cancer because of Internal warts that cover the cervex.

I carry the type that can cause external warts.

I'm very educated about this because I have it. 

No mouth or lung cancer.

This isn't HIV and this thread is blowing up a lot of miss truths and assumptions.  

I'm 41 and sexual monogamy is my policy been married for 15 years.


"
1415,"Or, you know, the penis. I think like most other STD's men having sex with men is the highest risk factor for it turning into throat cancer.

"
1416,"HPV vaccine is only ~15 years old iirc, date range on those figures says 2009-2013, i wonder how much impact it wouldve had in such a short timeframe, and probably not in slightly older people who would then be developing cancers, "
1417,"That wouldn't have been the case in this data set. It only goes up to 2012, when the first round of women to receive the vaccine would be 34ish. Almost all of the head/neck cancers occurred in people 40 and over. "
1418,"I also think the act of cunnilingus is more likely to result in an infection than fellatio, especially given the fact that so many american men are cut."
1419,Why no flair?
1420,So does a hpv test now exist for men?
1421,How dare you say you have credentials without flare. 
1422,"Do you have data about primer specificity by HPV subtype?

About 13 years ago I designed a universal HPV primer set for a non clinical detection scheme… Because of intrinsic variability across strains and also certain secondary structures nearby conserved regions this was a bit harder than you might suspect.  Ultimately we created a multiplex primer set that initially drove MDA for non-strain-specific but HPV specific amplification, and then switched to PCR diagnostic amplification for all known important strains…  Tried to get funding for developing it for clinical use, but at the time PCR based diagnostics were a non-starter for grant money.  Would be interested to know how current detection works."
1423,[deleted]
1424,"> HPV is most commonly tested for via PCR. Its a human pathogen, it only presents in human cells, not bacterial cells.
> 
> 

Doesn't mean it can't impact flora through indirect means. There are ample examples of oral-fecal viruses having altered infectivity rates depending on bacteria already present. Polio and LPS interactions come to mind."
1425,"Because there are side effects to every medical procedure and it probably made sense to do the research before telling people they need to take it.

But I do know people have been unofficially been recommending that all kids get the vaccine for years. "
1426,[removed]
1427,For women it also protects against cervical cancers where as men don't get that. So although the HPV thing is important it was a cancer protecting vaccine for women.
1428,"I have no idea, but I was older than the recommended age when it came out, and I tried multiple times to get it (even offering to pay out of pocket). I had several physicians straight up refuse til I just gave up. Still not vaccinated. I'm pretty confused by the arbitrary age cap, tbh. I assume I've been exposed to some strains but potentially not, so why not just get it?"
1429,"Guy here, my parents had me get the HPV vaccine about 8 years ago when I was 17. It wasn't that difficult for guys to get it. It just wasn't the norm."
1430,"If they initially did clinical trials in women, then that's all they can go off at the time. Same works for flu vaccines, as just an example. You do an initial trial in adults 18-49, the safest group. First season, it's only for those people. Then next season, after positive results, you can expand to, say, 18-60 and eventually 6mo-60. It's a step-wise regulatory setup that compromises between getting drugs to those who need it but also measured risk-taking. It is abundantly clear that women would receive a huge benefit, but initially less so for men. Now it is also clear they will reap big benefits, so we branch out from there. "
1431,"Who knows? One reason at top of mind is a general growth in vaccine skepticism, which in part seems related to a disconnect between the number and purpose of vaccines recommended, and the lay understanding of those recommendations.

This is a day and age in which the Measles Mumps Rubella vaccine is being questioned, despite the clear horrors of those diseases in history. HPV, relatively speaking, lacks such visceral, visible horrors, and so is presumably a harder sell as a mandatory vaccine than MMR."
1432,"I thought it was because symptoms are almost never present in men, and the affects of the virus on men are less severe than in females. I believe HPV is linked to cervical cancer, but I'm not sure of the links between HPV and cancers in men."
1433,"That's a bit pedantic, the pap smear looks for abnormal cervical epithelial cells. There really isn't a comparable test in men which was the OP's point."
1434,"While that is true, I'm sure it can *affect* the flora in a way that makes it recognizable by testing.

Similar to how some cancers can be detected with a urine test, even though it's not urine cancer."
1435,"It's not discrimination to only give certain drugs to people when it is medically appropriate. The initial trials were focused on whether or not the vaccine prevented HPV from causing abnormalities and cancer in the cervix. Thus, the FDA approved giving the vaccine to people with a cervix to prevent cancer. 

There were separate later trials to find out if it would prevent genital warts/penile cancer in men. These were successful, and the vaccines are now being recommended to boys. But they had to do the trial first because they had no way of knowing if it would actually be helpful. "
1436,You’ve missed a bit of nuance. By saying that they used to be male-presenting they’re implying that today they are not.
1437,"You knew what it meant, so why bother complaining?"
1438,"There's no indication that non-human mammals have gender identity. It might be something that only happens in self-conscious social species.

You can't define away a complex reality."
1439,"Yes, he is male, and he was presenting which in medical terms often ""refers to when a condition is first noticed by a physician or first brought to a physician's attention."""
1440,Isn't the implication there that they didn't get the HPV vaccine before a transition and that they now have it? That would be a significant detail.
1441,I got it as a male at least 10 years ago 
1442,"They aren’t talking rates of cancer from HPV.  They’re talking rates of infection of HPV, which would be shown pretty quickly"
1443,what about the rate at which we are now vaccinating women
1444,IIRC smoking and drinking increases the odds of developping HPV-related head and neck cancers
1445,"Thanks! He gets them all over his skin, but the most serious one was oropharyngeal that metastasized to his lymphatic system, and then lungs (he was stage 4a when diagnosed)."
1446,That’s just how it’s given.  A first dose then you go back a month or so later for the second dose 
1447,10+ years is a long time.
1448,"""Continues"" implies the opposite of that."
1449,[deleted]
1450,and 70% of anal and oropharyngeal cancers which is why men benefit from this vaccine as well. 
1451,[deleted]
1452,Gardasil contains HPV6 and 11 which are non-oncogenic and cause genital warts. In the phase 3 study we had 90% reduction in warts incidence. Source: worked on the vaccine. 
1453,[deleted]
1454,"I would consider 11/13 a majority of cancer-causing strains. conversely, there are around 90 strains that are not cancer-causing, and most HPV vaccines today prevent more non-cancer-causing than cancer-causing.

But okay."
1455,"It seems like what she's said has been factually correct. Rather than blanket her comment as something to be disregarded, why don't you point out what exactly is wrong?"
1456,[deleted]
1457,"Do you have a source on this? I've been looking for the information for a while but google only pulls up general ""What is HPV?"" and ""talk to your kids"" type websites"
1458,Only certain strains are cancerous.  It just depends on which strain you are exposed to. The vaccine is supposed to prevent exposure to the known cancerous strains 
1459,"It's TRUE that there is a slight chance that a man turns into a wizard at 30... Most people dont know that HPV is actually a bioengineered weapon designed against wizards in that it prevents men from becoming wizards. It was created BY wizards to reduce competition from other wizards as our population exploded post industrial age. Cultured from a sample taken from a witches nose wart (long known for its suppression of the male libido) and transmuted using an arcane spell taken from the long lost original final pages of the Kama Sutra, it was first unleashed upon an amorous young woman in the 1923 Sanfrancisco flapper scene. The transmutation was a failure in that instead of suppressing the libido after infection it placed the witches wart upon the genitals of both sexes. The physical symptoms were both a failure and a success though, while people were slightly more scrutinous in their sexual partners the unfortunately infected drove the need for a vaccine. Tested and trialed for generations hundreds of thousands of wizards were scarred and muted while generations of women gave birth to male children who would never turn into wizards. Avoidance of the virus continues and we find ourselves in need of suppressing not only wizards but also the cancers that potentially are caused by infection. The vaccine gracefully kills two birds with one stone and leads to a new era of peace by avoiding wizard wars and cancer. True story."
1460,"Insurance will only cover it until age 26 though. I got HPV around the time I turned 26 so I never got a chance. Because you need multiple shots I can't afford to get the vaccine. 

When I was diagnosed it was already precancerous. Everyone should get the shot if they can afford to. "
1461,Not true. If you're a male over 26 they've traditionally said no. But if you cause to believe you've been exposed the recent consensus is to get you vaccinated 
1462,It's 26 in the US before insurance will stop covering it.
1463,I wouldnt know. This is the first ive heard of it tbh
1464,"I'm not OP and don't have a link about hpv handy right now, but in general switching to Google scholar helps with this problem on any subject. You can also include terms like nih or who (or the relevant bodies for other topics) to get info from more in-depth sources.

Also for anyone reading: THERE IS A NEW HPV VACCINE. If you were vaccinated as a teenager, you may need to get a new shot! The original guardasil only covered 4 strains, the new one protects against NINE. It's a series of three shots and you have the best immune response if you get them all. HPV causes anal, penile, cervical, and throat cancers, and condoms do not fully protect against it! Whatever your gender, you can help stop the spread of this disease by getting vaccinated."
1465,"*i'm a 30 year old virgin man why did u have to do me like this*
"
1466,"While I don't know the specifics, I started growing papillomas and warts very rapidly at one point, and from what I understand the biopsy showed them to be caused by HPV. I'm not aware of which type, but this was relatively soon after I began being sexually active, which may have resulted in that diagnosis. 

The warts and papillomas are painless and small, and are also well hidden so they don't affect my appearance or life in any way"
1467,"Speaking from knowledge provided by doctor friends and family: All warts come from a virus in the HPV family, but not all HPV strains are linked to cancer (the actual main concern here). The kind of warts you'd see on someone's face versus one in the genitals may be related but likely different strains. They both do the same thing though: produce a growth on the body. Millions of people get common warts all the time, which is likely what you had. The main ""inconvenience"" of HPV is cosmetic aberration of a wart, and those are usually frozen or burned off with a mild acid.

Cervical cancer becomes the main concern for women as HPV is linked to higher incidences of that. Anal cancer is also a concern, though more so for men who have sex with men. Warts can grow inside as well as outside the body, so removing may not be so easy as freezing them off but instead involve the use of surgical lasers and such. 

That said, because what is known is so limited, doctors and researchers will always err on the side of caution and recommend you do all things possible to reduce risk. I wouldn't worry myself too much about it, but if its available and affordable to you, the HPV vaccine is one way to help limit exposure to many of the strains, some of which are more closely linked to cancer than others."
1468,"All warts are caused by HPV, not all HPV strains cause cancer, HPV is not exclusively sexually transmitted. "
1469,"Yes, all warts are a strain of HPV."
1470,"Several common strains of HPV are associated with genital transmission. Of those strains, some don't even cause warts commonly (but can still be transmitted). Some of those strains are associated with an increased risk of cancer. So the HPV vaccines protect against a few strains which are known for high transmission, and increase the risk of cancer most significantly, or are highly likely to cause unsightly warts. A wart on your hand is unlikely to be one of those strains (though maybe it could be).

If you haven't had the vaccine, it could offer you protection from the strains you haven't been exposed to yet, and may even be helpful in prognosis for the strains you have been exposed to, if any."
1471,"Yes, most warts on hands are cause by HPV 1, these are not the same as the HPV strains that usually cause genital warts.  The strain that most commonly causes hand or foot or body warts is not in the vaccine.  ""gardasil 9"" the genital wart vaccine covers the 2 strains of HPV most likely to cause cancer, as well as the next 7 most likely. The first two make up the majority of the causes of cancer however. 

You can get the vaccine at any age, but it is reccomended you get it before you are sexually active to maximize efficacy. 

All according the the CDC and there like... 20 pages on HPV and the gardasil vaccines. "
1472,"That’s the issue with messaging around HPV. It’s commonly billed as an STI but it’s transmittable with non-sexual contact, mere physical contact is enough. You can touch a wart on someone’s arm with your hand and may contract HPV in the process, for example.

STI / relations with sexual activity contribute to stigma and overall concern about HPV in unfortunately unproductive ways. Fear can motivate both proactive or avoidant health behaviors. "
1473,"26 is the labeled indicated age cut off from the manufacturer. It's the age under which it is proven to be most effective. It's also the age cut off for most health insurance to cover the cost. So if you want to get it after that, you'll have to pay out of pocket.

You don't have to be a virgin, but it's most effective if given before you've had any exposure to the strains included in the vaccine, which is why the earlier the better."
1474,"The age cut off used to be even lower than the current 20something, and it was for two reasons: Studies were done with teenagers as the target group and most importantly: The vaccine is most effective before you've had sex which is because, as you correctly said, we are assuming you already had one of those strains.

But since there's still benefits even if you had one of the strains that's vaccinated against the recommended age got increased.

I don't think it'll increase much further in the US though, since that would require the insurance companies to pay for everyone. I believe they'll strongly oppose it because of cost-benefit analysis."
1475,"Dude. Get a new PCP. PCPs are awesome!

Source: I am a family physician and I always accept new patients."
1476,"PCPs are like barbers. Some are awful at their jobs, some are real professionals. The office I goto has one PA that I would trust over any doctor, and one PA I wouldn’t trust to give me Tylenol correctly. 

It’s hit or miss, you just need to find the right person you click with. "
1477,I bet you’re lots of fun at parties. Have a nice day. 
1478,"Thanks! Yes, it was the ASCUS result. Since the colposcopy showed CIN 2 (moderate dysplasia), I either had the option of doing LEEP or waiting six months to see if there are any cell changes. I chose to wait, and I'm hoping that my body kicks it, but I DO have an autoimmune disease that may or may not impede that process. Staying positive. :)

Edit: a word"
1479,"right, but you're a woman.  It's almost impossible for adult men to get it.
"
1480,I'm confused - how did the pharmacy give you the vaccine without a prescription?
1481,Not if you're male.  ...at least you'll spend weeks trying to find a doctor that'll prescribe it to you.
1482,Yes. Although I don't know many physicians who would be willing/suggest it.  I wouldn't know for sure if it's as effective or has any increased risk though I'd suspect the efficacy and risks would be the same. 
1483,"Unfortunately the HPV vaccine targets cancer-causing HPV, not benign wart causing HPV.

Better luck with cryotherapy."
1484,[removed]
1485,[removed]
1486,I would hope any sensible doctor would know that these vaccines are necessary and suggest it onto the public as such regardless of requirement by law.
1487,"I was going to get one but my mom was slowly falling into the essential oils, all natural, anti-gmo, anti-vaccine group at the time and refused to allow me to get a new and “untested” vaccine that I wasn’t even required to get. Luckily, she only started doing that around the time I was 16 - 17ish so I still ended up with my vaccinations growing up.

She’s better about it now but still a little infuriating to talk to about health stuff. "
1488,This would mean it is officially recommended by the FDA for boys 9-26.  Your doctor is free to recommend it for you. 
1489,"I mean it’s not gonna kill you, and it won’t give you autism. "
1490,Yeah same for me in Canada. This was 2015 I believe. The doctor told me that the shot has been mostly marketed to women but she recommended that men also get it as well. I was under the impression it was only for women regarding cervical cancer but I got it anyways. 
1491,[removed]
1492,"Not a cloudy memory. The drug itself was approved by the FDA it just wasnt recommended for boys by the FDA. What that article states is that the advisory panel only recently stated that the FDA should start recommending it for boys as well as girls.

Doctors however, understood the benefits of having boys be vaccinated (benefits such as herd immunity) and have been recommending it ever since the drug was introduced.

The FDA is just a little slow on some things. And by that i mean really slow. Among the government organizations they are one of the most understaffed. Sometimes they have to borrow people from the CDC to help them with their work. "
1493,"It has been around.  The reason for the confusion is the infection usually just clears for males and leads to sterility or cancer in women.  So, males are generally ""carriers"".  It would certainly be sound to have the vaccine applied before sexual activity, but that's the reason for some folks thinking boys don't need it."

1506,Thank you for pointing out a problem with my wording.
1507,Aren't there mutliple vaccines some of which can be beneficial for guys?
1508,Thanks for the heads up. I edited my comment to reflect that. Much appreciated. 
1509,"It would read that males over 26 are not allowed to get the vaccine, is that true?"
1510,"Also, physicians were prescribing and administering gardasil to boys and men before the FDA approved indications.  This is called ""off-label"" use, and it happens a lot, but not often with vaccines."
1511,I'm a 24 year old American male.  I don't know if I have been vaccinated for this or not. Does anyone have any idea as to how I could figure out if I have been or how i can be vaccinated against HPV?
1512,"Yeah, it's a very weird case study.  I won't pretend to be an expert but I do know that medical conditions and symptoms sometimes manifest themselves differently with each sex. My mother in law died from a heart attack that we misdiagnosed because it didn't meet the male symptoms, which we assumed held equally for both sexes. "
1513,"My primary care doctor recommended it and I got it in high school 5+ years ago so it's not a new thing. That said, I'm from MA rather than a backwards state so idk if we're ahead of the curve."
1514,">But not approved by the FDA until September 2017.

I wanted to say that I urged my (male) SO to get the vaccine. He is younger than me and I got it a bit later in life and ended up paying for my final shot out of pocket because I was past the age limit. My SO was not past the age limit yet, so I encouraged him to get it, he got the first 2 shots fine, but when it came time for the third we had moved and were living in another city. He talked to his original Dr who sent in a script to the clinic nearby for him to have it done. I can't remember exactly what happened but the clinic seemed to have a difficult time first finding the script and then giving him the vaccine. In fact they told him they only had the female version of the vaccine. Other people I have spoke to said that is BS, because there's just one version of it. It seemed like the clinic we visited couldn't give him the final vaccine dose, because he was a guy. Which went against everything we were told about why men AND women should get the vaccine. This was probably before sept 2017, which makes me wonder if the clinic was hesitant to administer it because it was not approved by the FDA for males yet? Either way, we ended up knowing someone who worked at the county health department and they administer the vaccines to low income individuals. We got his final dose that way, even though technically, we are not low income, but we had no other way to get it. "
1515,"Doctors can often give stuff off label if there's some scientific research to support it or a medical need. FDA approval means a company can market it for that indication, ie use in boys "
1516,"I do not know for certain, but I recall reading an article that the initial trials for the vaccine only focused on women. So the FDA specifically completed testing for women only before approving Guardasil the first time around. I think they started testing it on males shortly after, but it just took time. Doctors knew that it was unlikely there would be different issues with males and started recommending it before the FDA completed testing and officially approved it in 2017. Again, I need to go look this up to see if I am actually correct. 

Edit: I’m super wrong, but will leave the above for context. From [Wikipedia ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardasil) , 
>>“ In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved administration of the Gardasil vaccine to males between ages 9 and 26 in October 2009.[30][31] The FDA approved administration of the Gardasil 9 vaccine to males between ages 9 and 15 in December 2014 and extended the age indication, by including males between ages 16 and 26, in December 2015.[32][33][34] In the UK, HPV vaccines are licensed for males aged 9 to 15 and for females aged 9 to 26.[35]”"
1517,It will be covered by health insurance. I had to pay out of pocket for my hpv shot as a male as it wasn't fda approved. 
1518,"I'm saying the FDA is established to monitor the safety of food and drugs for people living in the US. They hadn't agreed upon its safety for males until fairly recently. 

I'm not saying it isn't safe for boys. The FDA clearly says it is.  I'm saying that I wouldn't want a doctor prescribing any form of treatment that hasn't been approved. "
1519,It does not mean as nearly as much as people give credence to it. Especially since certain people have been bashing and eroding the FDA. We now have plenty of drugs which should not have been let into the market 
1520,I know.  That's what is bizarre to me. 
1521,Edited to provide source
1522,"Gotcha.  I'll make that edit. Thanks! 

Edit: wait, approved for boys in 2006? That's who we are talking about in this thread. "
1523,I don't know.

Good thing they don't let people decide for themselves just where the lines are drawn on a cost/benefit analysis."
1534,"[The rates of head,  neck and oral cancers among men are rapidly growing because many many more men than women are infected with HPV and unaware of it. More men than women now have a HPV-related cancer](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna811466)

[HPV can also cause infertility in men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5679371/)

And yet we don’t even have HPV test for men, and you never even hear about this. Women get pap smears every few years, but those other cancers are so dangerous because they cause no symptoms until much later when they’re already deep-rooted.

1535,"Men who have sex with men (abbreviated as MSM in the literature) are now being screened at specialty clinics with anal paps. However, this is not currently the standard of Care (although it is a gap in knowledge and study due to political/social issues intersecting with science.) 

also, as a family doc taking care of patients for MSM to be honest it’s not on my mind when I’m discussing routine health maintenance mostly out of ignorance than anything else. I’ll strive to do it routinely — and luckily in the Greater Boston area with have Fenway Health which is nationally renowned for its work with the LGBTQI community."
1536,"You’re right, I never considered all the variables including throat and rectal cancer.

I did say everyone should have it available to them regardless but the main cancer caused by hpv, is cervical. 

Warts are just an inconvenience and aren’t the cancer causing strains. That’s the only point I was making really. 

It’s a good thing for everyone and it seems counterproductive to target one gender."
1537,Terrorists. That's who!
1538,"The more prudent problem with that analogy is that sex isn't akin to jumping off a building, and you need to agree otherwise for the sake of the analogy. It's that sort of dishonest rationality that tries to slip it past you that sex itself is the problem while distracting you with the notion that the solution isn't sensible. "

1540,"No, he said it is thought to be more effective when given at a younger age, *not taking into account exposure*.  I had a hard time finding a journal article but the CDC website alludes to this.

> CDC makes recommendations based on the best available scientific evidence. Studies have shown that two doses of HPV vaccine given at least six months apart to adolescents at age 9–14 years worked as well or better than three doses given to older adolescents and young adults. Studies have not been done to show this for adolescents starting the series at age 15 years or older."
1541,"It's probably like the chicken pox vaccine. If you get it before a certain age (I think 12?), you only need the one shot. If you get it past that age, you need 2 shots.

Edit. I was trying to point out that some vaccines do indeed offer better protection when administered at an younger age, and the HPV vaccine might be like that. Not sure if that was clear..."
1542,My niece is 23 and it was definitely around for her.  My sister unfortunately made a conscious decision to deny it to her. 
1543,"I mean, he was very much still an abusive asshole. But now I won't get HPV, so that's good."
1544,Because that's not how vaccines work. The HPV vaccine doesn't work after a certain age.
1545,They mean that the argument in favour of it could be based around that to counter the anti vaccination argument of condoning premarital sex. 
1546,I swear the hardcore Christians are going to reinvent the burqa one of these days
1547,"Well, from what I have read, the argument in favor of adults in the general population being vaccinated against the flu (yes, every year) is that it will help safeguard against children, the elderly, and those who are immunocompromised from becoming very ill from a strain that a healthy person may have just been a carrier of.  "
1548,"That's very unfortunate. Strangely, I've mostly seen the anti-vax arguments from the religious right"
1549,"I think the reasoning they use is different. Conservative anti-vaxers tend to be anti-government types that don't trust the CDC (who they think, for whatever reason, create and manufacture all vaccines).

1560,"I imagine that for something to count as ""preventive"" medicine and be covered by insurance there should be good evidence that it works in the specific populations it's being recommended to. We only have good evidence that it works well for people under 26. Obviously there is no real difference between 26 and 27 year olds, but insurance companies are trying to make as much money as possible so they're not going to cover people they aren't obligated to cover. 
The annoying part was that I was denied it in my country of origin before 26 because I had been sexually active and then I went through a few years in the US with no healthcare insurance. Basically if I die of cervical cancer it's because of bureaucracy. "
1561,I’m 25 and I read they give it out to males 26 and under. Everyone on here is saying most sexually actively people definitely have it. I feel like there’s no point for me to get it at this point.

Then when I was around 27 they said that it could be covered for men under 26. Which is a bit annoying when you're just over the arbitrary age cutoff.

Now, I'm in a committed relationship of a few years, but I'm thinking I should consider paying out of pocket for it. The problem is, I'm pretty broke right now since I decided to go back to school. Would have been nice if my insurance covered it for me any time in the last 10 years..."

Not many, I would think. They just cut your penis off."
1574,">It wasn't tested and approved for boys yet doctors were giving it to them for years. That's problematic. 

I'm confused about what you're saying here. Boys were NOT getting the vaccines and that was due to the cost. Insurance companies wouldn't cover it in the US because of the FDAs recommendations, not because of the FDA approvals.

It was approved in 2006 for all people regardless of gender. Again, there is no physiological difference in the immune systems of men and women, a vaccine works the same way for both genders.

More recently, the WHO and subsequently the FDA has come forward and officially recommended it to all people due to on going research, but that didn't have to do with approvals or differences in vaccines. The vaccine is the same for men and women."
1575,">For many years after the vaccine was deemed safe and effective it was still only given to the female population. 

Again, it was initially deemed safe and effective for preventing CERVICAL CANCER. The immune response in mucosal organs is very compartmentalized. Just because an immune response does a good job at protecting the cervix doesn't necessarily mean that it will be effective in protecting the skin, the anus, or the penis or that it will prevent transmission. The trials absolutely needed to be done to see if the vaccine would have any effect outside of protecting the cervix. 

Besides, Gardasil was FDA approved for females in 2006 and for males in 2009. That's actually pretty damn quick for a clinical trial. "
1576,"You aren't going to lifestyle away the virus. You may be able to prevent outbreaks, but the virus will still be there."

1579,"I’m with you on the fact that it’s overkill. I personally am not afraid but there are people who are overly cautious and I’m not about to shame them if we’re doing the horizontal mambo. I haven’t used a barrier for maybe 99.99% of the handjobs and oral sex I’ve received and I’m not saying everyone should, but as a fan of anonymous sex, open relationships and all-around debauchery, I never say no when a partner suggests additional protection.  FWIW I did end up finishing myself off when I was asked to use a condom during that handjob—it was after a rather long session of penetrative sex where I didn’t achieve orgasm (curse you, liquor!) and I remember telling her “this is just going to take even longer”. At the end of the day communication and agreement are key in any sexual encounter."
1580,"HPV doesn't need to get into blood to spread, it seems like you're confusing it with HIV. It can spread by just skin contact, hence why condoms aren't a sure bet on preventing it because you can get infected on your scrotum/base of the penis where it touched the labia during sex. Also why you can get an oropharyngeal infection from oral sex. There's even debate on whether deep kissing can spread HPV oral infections because there's some studies where people who were still virgins but had kissed people had their throats infected by the virus."
1581,"What about bone marrow transplant, blood donation, or forced isolation of hospitalized patients with transmissible diseases? None of those are of benefit to the donor/patient beyond making them feel like a responsible citizen or a good neighbor. They take on risk and discomfort just to benefit others.  One is even coerced, but none are evil or illegal. A man volunteering to get the HPV vaccine might have the same psychological benefit as a blood donor, and that would justify granting him access.

I agree with your main point, but both of us have only mentioned part of what was a very long and nuanced discussion.  However, i don’t think the legality of recommending that men be allowed to volunteer to receive HPV was ever an issue (the legality of mandatory vaccination of any kind, if that’s what you mean, is a separate issue)."
1582,"Thanks for the response. Your situation seems very similar to mine. I went to the doctor about a year and a half ago and was told I have hemmeroids but then went back 8 weeks later to be told I have hpv. J started getting worried when I started seeing blood in my stool

I will mention surgical treatment to my go at my next check "
1583,"Like what? I am genuinely curious. Didn't get the vaccine for HPV when I offered before college because I didn't get an explanation beyond it's optional. Now I have been in the same relationship since early high school, so I figured there was no need.  "

1596,They said males.
1597,"Of course I would.   Except you haven't done that.

You've pointed to a study that reviews the prevention of Cervical Cytological Abnormalities and a double blind study that shows the prevention of ""pre-cancer""; neither of these things are cervical cancer.   You're running on the same leap of logic that assumes these are the standalone causes; and you don't acknowledge the TOR pathway's role in cancer prevention.

It's the same problem statins have, it effectively reduces LDL yet when you look at studies of overall morbidity and mortality no difference based on untreated populations.    Yet billions a year spent.   

This vaccine is just another boondoggle of money that could be directed to actual research on prevention and real cures the NIH simply can't afford to fund; let alone their international equivalents.   I'd rather see all this public money sent to researchers like Yoshinori Ohsumi to fund studies that will actually get us to a step-function reduction in cancer."

1614,It wasn't given to boys anyways at that time.
1615,"> There have been a handful of deaths potentially associated with the vaccine but given the tens of millions of doses given you are much more likely to die of preventable cancer. 

I'm not convinced there is any serious danger for this vaccine, but playing devil's advocate, if there were, I don't think those numbers line up the way you are suggesting when we're talking about vaccinating male children.

Yes, vaccinating males even with a small risk of death may be worth it compared to the higher number of lives saved from not getting cancer from a pure numbers perspective, but the party taking the risk is not the party being protected in that case because women are the ones at higher risk of getting cancer from HPV. So you'd essentially be asking males to take a risk of death with no corresponding benefit to them. I can see why a parent would decide that a reduced risk of death to *someone else* is not worth an increased risk of death to their child.

Again, this assumes there is such a risk, which I haven't seen any evidence of. I'm just pointing out that it's a different situation from one in where the person being vaccinated receives a direct benefit themselves."
1616,"Yes, I believe you can. I think they just want people to get it younger because it’s more helpful if you haven’t yet been exposed to the virus. "
1617,Yeah but how do you know this isn't just all a big government conspiracy with the reptile people?  If you didn't personally witness the study then it's suspect IMO.

1620,"This is the answer I was looking for. Can't be too careful with kids being highly sexualised these days. 

My circumcision point is going off the assumption that a foreskin is bad, and so they lob it off while assuming every baby boy will be having unprotected sex. Even if they did, there's no proof that a foreskin or lack thereof has any real effect on STDs. This is not the case with HPV, obviously. But a lot of chances can be reduced with condoms. So on a similar but also different note, that's a position I will not budge on. Vaccines do make sense. Bodily harm does not."

1640,"Not that I know of. I mean, it was *always* possible to test men if you want to basically scar their penis taking skin cells off to test. The reason we can test women is because of where the virus presents itself and relative ease of swabbing the area... while it can be anywhere on a mans penis or testicles. 

The problem was never the *test* as it would be the exact same test as the women. The problem was and still is the collection method. For women in is a swab of the cervic. For men, it would almost require taking sandpaper to the entirety of their organ, collecting the remnants and testing all of that.

I.E. We can test men for non cancerous types because they highlight themselves with a wart, but the cancerous types are non-descript, and would require a copious amount of skin cells from all over the penis and testicles to properly test like we do women.  "

No, I don't. I haven't actually worked with human pathogens in a while. I work in livestock and wild animal vaccines mostly.

The two don't really compare in those ways. If you can find other similar viruses, sure there is an argument to be made. But the two viruses now being discussed don't really have anything in common. "

This supports the CDC and your doctor's statement that immunisation in the 9-14 group gives stronger immunity than in the 15-25 group.  However, immunity declines with age so it doesn't assert that it will necessarily give the same immunity at age 20.

I had previously though that vaccine efficacy was not so different based on age at immunisation, though was aware that older adults mount weaker immune responses including to vaccines.

The problem is that is someone gets a headache or dry mouth after, then it’s added to the “may cause” list. No big deal. But, someone gets MS or Lupus or epilepsy or goes blind or dies days or weeks or months after the vaccination, “there’s no way you can prove it wouldn’t have happened any way, so it can’t be the vaccine’s fault.” And then, like you said, it’s easier to throw money at it. 

The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) handles these claims.....at a rate of $6million/100 claims......which seems to be no big deal to the drug companies—especially when they can keep saying “totally benign side effects” after they settle. And you’ve already talked about cost per vaccination. 

I’d rather have my daughter than that cash. How do I know who’s lying? That’s really all I care about.

So, the literature and research shows that 26 is the cut-off. This is for 2 reasons...evidence shows that when you receive the vaccine at a younger age, you build a stronger immunity. Also, many people by age 26 have already had sex and have been exposed to the virus/several strains of the virus. 

That being said, it’s not like 26 is some sort of magical age and after that the vaccine won’t work. If it were me, or advice that I was giving my brother, I’d say get it.

While this is mostly true, there ARE physiological differences in the different body parts that can be affected by HPV induced cancers.

What is made clear in all data people can find, even online (saving trips to planned parenthood et al)

Good to know, that might be a guideline more than a policy but I said that from memory, so i'm not sure of what's what.  
  
As for the virus, HPV is particularly resistant to air, cold, detergents, some solvent...All of this makes for a very highly contagious type of virus that can survive a long time and be transmitted via skin contact.
"
1788,"Yes, such as trans men."
1789,">neither of these things are cervical cancer

They are pre-cancers and signs of tissue at high risk of turning into cancer, all of which have different progression rates to cervical cancer. These progression rates are [not ""leap"" in logic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5625966/). It's evidence based. 

I never said TOR never had a role in cancer occurence. It does. You are ignoring the HPV oncogenes and effect of HPV integration into human DNA. When HPV enters epithelial cells (skin cells), certain viral strains with genes E6 and E7, act as tumor promoters which integrate into the human DNA. This very process is what promotes malignant transformation of cells into cancer cells. 

I am not talking about statins. I am talking about pathology and physiology which is already well studied. Carcinoma insitu is not a benign finding. It is places a person at higher risk of developing cancer. This fact is confirmed in population studies as well as looking at the actual cellular pathogensis of cervical cancer. 

The fact that companies make money doesn't change the science. Denying the science is insane and stupid. "

1795,"Do you understand what I am saying? Legitimation crisis means government corruption has ruined public confidence and trust, which is what drives anti vaxx views. You can't have people at CDC and FDA doing revolving door jobs in the industry they are supposed to regulate without losing huge amounts of confidence. That and the still partially unexplained rise in autism totally destroyed public confidence and dropped voluntary vaccination rates. Solution: reform government, not debate with anti-vaxxers."
1796,I wonder why the French don't have major outbreaks considering their vaccination schedule is so much smaller than ours.

It takes a distorted world view to think nefarious conspiracies are behind every corner and in my view I think humans are too incompetent the get away with large scale conspiracies. Too many people would have to be in on it.  True, there's been plenty of instances of fraud, but they usually get found out eventually because like I said, people are mostly incompetent. "

1803,"You send a paper to an editor, to be published within that editor's journal. The editor is typically well respected and established in their field; the editor is also usually voted in/chosen by their field as well. The editor removes any personally identifying information about the author of the paper and sends it reviewers, who are also typically well known and established within their discipline, who then review the paper. They are not supposed to know who wrote it, and the author is not supposed to know who reviewed it, and are supposed to subsequently judge it based off of the merits of the paper. From their they send the reviewed paper back to the editor who will choose to a) request that the author modify it to address the concerns of the reviewers b) publish it c) refuse to publish it, even if it were modified. 

Interestingly, the anti-vaxxer 'push' was started on account of a study released to an esteemed peer reviewed journal. However, it was later retracted and the physician got his license to practice medicine taken away. That is to say, even where peer reviewed, publications can get it wrong. Including committees. 

Edit: as a matter of fact, it isn't unheard of for authors of publications, even within academic journals, to later retract their articles. Often times because their own stance on the issue has changed, other information has been released that they weren't aware of, or because they didn't consider another issue. I would ask people to read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Martinson.  By way of what u/logicordie has written alone, I wouldn't say that it's advertising more than anything else and that he likely does indeed misunderstand the processes involved if he thinks the involvement of a second committee is advertising."

1822,Not infecting their life partner with a cancer causing virus definitely benefits men. Medically or otherwise. Most men prefer not to raise their kids alone. (In my country vaccination rates for girls have sunk below 50%)
1823,Men have higher rates of oropharyngeal cancer though
1824,"Don't men get oral and penile cancers from HPV? Also gay/bi men should be vaccinated for this and if we're recommending it for pre-teens before they have sex or before people come out, it prevents it for that population too."

Acting as a normal boy is considered disruptive and male children are medicated from an early age. And even the medical community now says ""fuck men let them die of cancer"". /rant"
1830,"And I should delete my comments as I just got done researching it again and I found that the CDC says that there is a possibility that cancerous forms of HPV can cause what they call ORAL HPV cancer but they can not say that the hpv cancer in the mouth was only caused by the HPV virus that other factors could have attributed like smoking/chewing or exposure to other toxic pollutants.

And what they found was that the positivity rate was the same if not a little bit higher in heterosexual men. Heterosexual men had seven and half percent positivity and men who have sex with men had a 7.1 percent positivity."

>HPV is is a dsDNA virus, polio is +ssRNA. There are some major mechanical differences there as to why you may see that.

That has literally nothing to do with what I'm talking about. I'm referring to possible indirect influences of bacterial flora. Both polio and HPV are infecting cells side-by-side with bacteria. Doesn't matter if it's a gut cell, throat cell, or cervix cell.

My example with polio and LPS is referring to virus capsid interactions with bacterial LPS. Both HPV and polio are non-enveloped viruses, so this random example works fine. The type of NA in the core doesn't matter here.

>As you said, polio is an enterovirus. HPV is not...

True but totally irrelevant for the reasons I already said above.

>The two don't really compare in those ways. If you can find other similar viruses, sure there is an argument to be made. But the two viruses now being discussed don't really have anything in common.

I just gave two similarities. And we didn't even have to touch on altered host immunity which would be important at interfaces between host and environment (i.e. gut, vagina, throat, etc.)."

Well, it was primarily approved to prevent cervical cancer, and boys don't have a cervix. Because of this, it took way too long for the FDA to actually change their recommendations. So, your doctor was merely following the FDA guidelines at the time, even if many other doctors were well aware of the stupidity of that approach, as the biggest benefit of most vaccines happen once you pass the herd immunity threshold.

Thing is, even without a cervix, if it prevented you from getting HPV in the first place from a previous partner, it would in effect protect your current partner and thereby prevent *them* from getting cancer.

Or, if you happen to have oral sex with your partner, it would protect against HPV induced oropharyngeal cancer.

So there were always reasons for boys to get it, just not for the primary preventative measure (protection against HPV induced cervical cancer).

1926,"Sorry, they tend to be very promiscuous. Of course there are exceptions but when we're talking about rates individuals don't matter"
1927,"I guess I just don't understand what you're saying.

As far as I understand, the most recent findings have been about cancer links in men. And that had to do with advances in testing and detecting it.

But whether it's a cancer risk or not to men or women, I would think that it would make sense to vaccinate everyone. I mean in it's various strains, it's the most common virus in the world right now. There are other negatives about HPV. It's not always asymptomatic in men and we've known that for a long time.

The whole reason that boys dont get routinely vaccinated had nothing to do with approvals. It is because insurance companies decided that it would be cheaper to pay to vaccinate women rather than treat women for cervical cancer. For men they didn't see the cost/benefit of prevention. Maybe they didn't have that data on men yet because the correlation between other types of cancer and HPV wasn't well known. Or maybe they did know and the numbers didn't make sense. Either way, the insurance companies will do the most to spend the least unless the FDA mandates these things.

But my point is, for the most common virus in the world, we should be vaccinating and covering everyone, rather than thinking of some people as a number on an actuarial table. If it was merely the physiological difference that you stated, then I wouldn't have such strong feelings about it."
1928,"You really can't blame people for not expecting it to prevent deaths in men until very recently. HPV was really only established as a major player in non-cervical cancers about 10ish years ago. Even today, we don't ACTUALLY know if the vaccine will prevent any of these other types of cancer. Because they take so long to develop, we'll have to wait and see for several more years before we know if vaccination made a difference or not.

With that said, the vaccine is low risk enough that it is definitely worth vaccinating males for the prevention of genital warts and for herd immunity. If it DOES end up preventing multiple types of cancer than even better."
1929,"Hi red_arma.  You asked ""how is or is the vaccine also working if you already had HPV warts but your body was strong enough to kill them all by itself? Like can it help people having it already?""

That's a good question, and it deserves answering.  

First, let's look at some background.  The first thing to know if that HPV is a group of viruses: Human Papilloma Viruses.  There are over 200 types of HPV, of which more than 40 can cause STD-type warts.  Those warts are passed by oral, anal, or vaginal sexual contact. Other types of HPV cause non-sexual warts, like regular skin warts.

Of all the different kinds of HPV out there, 4 types cause problems.  HPV 6 and 11 cause 90% of all genital warts.  These can cause other problems, too, like unusual lung disorders.  The other two problem viruses are worse: 16 and 18.  These two viruses cause most cervical cancers, and cervical cancer used to be (before the vaccine) the most common cause of cancer death in women. HPV 16 also causes most cases of anal cancer and 70% of oropharyngeal cancers.  

Because of that, we made a vaccine, Gardasil, that protects against those four worst kinds of HPV.

That's the background.  So, to your question.  I want to answer it a few different ways, because there's some important and related information to get across:

Let's say you already had genital warts, like HPV 11.  Your body fought it off, and now you're recovered.  Unfortunately, HPV is a tricky virus.  Even once your immune system has won, it ""goes underground"" and hides inside your body (inside women's cervical cells, for instance).  Later, it can re-emerge to cause problems.

Let's say later you get exposed to, say, HPV 16. Your previous infection with HPV 11 doesn't give you any immunity to the HPV 16.  It's a new virus to you.  So, you can get several types of HPV infection at once.  

Now, if you go get vaccinated, you're protected against the two most common causes of genital warts, and the most common causes of a few different kinds of cancer.  But there are still 38 or so other types of HPV out there that you could get.  The vaccine doesn't protect you from them, but they are less common and not as likely to cause problems.

Also, if you already caught HPV 16, 18, 6, or 11, the HPV vaccine won't cure your infection.  That isn't how vaccines work, and there is no cure for genital warts.  When you have it, you have it.  The vaccine will only prevent you from getting other types of HPV in the future.  However, if your partner is vaccinated against a type that you know you have, then they should be protected from the virus.  Talk to your doctor about safe sex practices if you are HPV positive.

Finally, most people who get HPV don't have any symptoms at all.  Unfortunately, many of those people still get cancer later in life.  If you already have had genital warts, even if you cleared it, you should speak to your doctor about whether or not you need testing or monitoring over time.    For instance, women still need to get cervical exams every few years to screen for the consequences of possible HPV infections.

Does that answer your question?"
1930,It wasn’t a question. 
1931,"I Well that same government source talks about how it is spread by skin-to-skin contact, I wouldn't worry about your hand but I was just specifically addressing your mention of needing to have a cut. It's not a blood borne pathogen, it infects squamous cells that are found on skin, anus, vocal cords, etc. it doesn't go into the blood stream and then find a site of infection. "
1932,"In women, Pap smears are the gold standard. In men, there is no gold standard but there are tests which detect HPV nucleic acids. It exists and I’ve had it done but there’s not enough data to support using it as a gold standard yet."

You must be thinking of HIV.

HPV is the human paploma virus aka genital warts.

But not everyone gets genital warts but i still carry HPV that causes it. 

The kind I carry causes vaginal warts which I have never had but my ex-wife who gave it to me has an immune difficacy so she got warts.

It's not the kind that causes cirvical cancer either and the HPV vaccine only works against the kind that gives you cancer.

Actually it has a lot to do with what we are talking about. Replication site in the cell, HPV in the nucleus, polio 
In the ER. Which means how it enters a cell is different and can impact the behavior of the cell its self.

Cell type also matters, and international cells are nothing like epithelial cells on the skin or sexual organs. 

>>As you said, polio is an enterovirus. HPV is not...
>True but totally irrelevant for the reasons I already said above.

You sure? What advantages does polio gain from altering how bacteria in the gut behave?... well the answer to that is in how the disease is spread. Like you said. Fecal oral. Messing with natural flora is important for this virus to increase its propagation. Increasing things like water content in a hosts stool can increase the likely hood that the disease spreads. 

No... it really isn't irrelevant. Because of the same reason I just gave. HPV does not gain the same advantage from altering host flora. Because it is not an enterovirus and is not spread via fecal-oral transmission.

1983,"That is exactly my point, thank you."
1984,"I'm not even sure what your point is here. 

When a human being is born they are immediately identified by what? 

Their genitalia, which is easily identified as one of 3 possibilities: male, female, or a combination (and note that the combination is merely the other two combined and is therefore not a completely new gender, just a genetic mutation). 

After that, there is of course no reason for the doctor to ""grab your genitalia"" at every visit since that was done at birth, conclusively and objectively.

""Male-presenting"" is a choice that you're trying to make seem objective. It's a choice in clothing, hairstyle, etc. Presentation is by definition a choice. The only thing that is subjective is society's unconscious determination about what that choice means (i.e. does a dress mean a girl? etc). 

Genitalia are objective."

1992,"> Wouldn't it be absolutely insane if this vaccine was a serious, effective treatment for cancer?

Unfortunately, the term ""cancer"" covers a wide variety of ailments. What ties them all together under the moniker of ""cancer"" is the concept of uncontrolled cell growth. The uncontrolled nature is posited through numerous methods. This is why there can't be a cure-all for cancer. It is possible to cure numerous different types of cancer now, which is awesome, but it is impossible to cure them all with just one method... other than death. ;)
"
1993,"Unlikely. There is no one cure for cancer because there is no one type of cancer. Most cancer can be classified into groups and states of growth, but even if you have a very common kind of cancer the cause of it could be something rare or elusive. In order to beat cancer we're going to need many 'cures', so many that eventually you're more likely to get a curable form of cancer than not, and so many that there are as many treatment plans as there are patients."

On one hand, things like myopia (nearsightedness) and ADHD are disorders, they are ""imperfections"" or deviations. On the other hand we have homosexuality, which has been removed as a disorder from the DSM.

As I understand psychiatry, what qualifies as a disorder is an issue that is disruptive enough that it gets in the way or normal life. Everyone gets sad or anxious from time to time, this much is natural, but that alone isn't ""Depression"" or ""Anxiety"".

This is one of the criticism brought forth by those who fear an over diagnosis/over-treatment of ADHD in minors. Being disruptive is part of being a child, and many grow out of it. Poor concentration/time management are real though and medication helps many (especially adults).

Where we draw the line is what interests me. We don't go around saying everyone with glasses or anyone with ADHD ""has a disorder"". To say ""they have a disorder"" carries implications that aren't necessarily true."

We aren't necessarily talking about *beneficial* floral changes for the virus...Just changes that correlate with infection. So the rest of your comment isn't particularly worth addressing. 

The OP in question essentially stated something very mild: that there are floral changes predictive of infection with HPV. Nobody would say this is controversial. It's entirely plausible. Handwaving about genome type, entry mechanisms, and so forth really don't address this and so it's not worth breaking it down further.

At this point I have to say nothing irks me more than someone with a bit of knowledge shitting on an entirely plausible idea just because it doesn't fit some preconceived notion.

I can’t remember - it was a few years ago.)
I only had one sexual partner at the time, my ex boyfriend, and my doctor estimated (based on the size of the growth) that I had been infected within the last few months, so that gave me a timeline to work with.
Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on how you see it), it is a strain that males only can carry - they show no signs or symptoms, and can’t even be tested for it - so I never found out 100% it was him, but it’s the only logical conclusion.
He still thinks I cheated to this day, because we can’t prove he even contracted it, but I’ve never cheated a day in my life and am an extremely faithful person.

In general, almost every illness we have vaccines against can be theoretically avoided if people took proper precautions. But it's far better to eliminate the threat of contracting the illness entirely rather than hoping every one of the 7 billion+ individuals on this planet knows and practices preventative behaviors perfectly 100% of the time."

That's changing now, and it looks like for the better. Then again you have spokesperson's like Michael Sheen blatantly stating that eating out a partner gave him throat cancer.

Where is the control group?

Surely such a study would be seen as unethical and not conducted? How can you possibly do a double blind?

The vaccine has been out for ten years: how is it possible to know the lifetime effects?

If they knew all this at the beginning, why did they only vaccinate girls? Isn't that unethical, putting men at risk? Unless males were the unofficial ""control"" group to test the vaccine safety? Gardasil was pushed through the FDA very quickly.

It is fascinating to me that viruses can cause cancer. I am however wondering about the logistics of conducting sound research here. All the anti vaxx panic has silenced debate over scientific practice, yes cancer is bad, but corporations aren't making vaccines altruistically, they are turning a profit.

The best we can do is be aware of the general symptoms of any kind of cancer https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-basics/signs-and-symptoms-of-cancer.html and get regular checkups.

Are you talking about intersex here? Because if you're not, it isn't a logical argument. 

If intersex, the assignment at birth of male and not now presenting as such presents a medical question that needs to be answered before sex-specific care is given. For instance, if both external genitalia are present at birth and subject is assigned male, but now presents as female, the presentation is meaningless from a medical perspective in the case of sex-specific treatment since the presence or absence of certain reproductive organs are what would be in question in that case (i.e. pap smear, ectopic pregnancy, whatever). 


So ""presenting"" is meaningless! If a sex-specific treatment is sought, OBVIOUSLY the sex organs present are what is relevant. A male-assignation presenting as female, but which possesses testicles, going to the doctor for testicular torsion, would check the box for ""male"" if seeking treatment for torsion.

Presentation is not medically relevant, and in fact can confuse the proper care, therefore, at some point, doctors will literally be checking genitalia for gender-specific treatment, if things continue in the nonsensical, antibiological way they've been heading."

I was there for just a meningitis shot, ended up with two types of meningitis shots and a chicken pox shot (because my first one was like two weeks too early it didn’t technically count and they only just realized to force me even though there are no reasons for it to be necessary for me to get another so I have had 3 now).

I'm worried that it's based on the faulty assumption that I am a typical human being. If they were assuming that the average person has 1 sex partner a year starting at age 16 and that 1 in 4 people have it, then I could see why you wouldn't be allowed to get it because you would've already exposed yourself to it 3 times, but that actually doesn't make sense because there are many varieties of HPV. There are ones that cause genital warts and ones that cause cervical (women) / oral (men) cancer, and the vaccine only protects you against a couple of the most cancerous varieties. It seems unlikely that the 3 times you would be exposed specifically to the ones contained in the HPV vaccine."

2213,"Exactly.  It had been approved for girls for years.  I don't feel comfortable with giving people some medicine that hasn't been approved.  Now that it has been approved for boys, I don't have a problem.

To use an analogy, let's say your wife or mom leaves a cupcake on the counter.  She's not home right now so you can't be certain if she didn't want you to eat it.  It's very possible she'd be fine, but sometimes she gets grumpy if you eat her food.  She comes home and tells you it's ok to eat. 

My stance is that it's better to wait for permission instead of acting while uninformed. "

2215,"Not likely. Randomized trials show that HPV contraction and carcinoma insitu rates are significantly different when applied to randomized populations receiving the HPV vaccine. Furthermore, cervical cancer has pathologic evidence of HPV effects, such as the virual oncogenes, notably E6 and E7, that promote metastatic transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. 

>they are turning a profit

this does not change the science. [Kalydeco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivacaftor#Economics) is a perfect example of capitalism profiting off of the desperation of patients. It doesn't change the fact that the intervention makes a difference in patient outcomes. 

>Where is the control group?

There was. Already included in the systematic review as well as the the RCC. The group that forgone the HPV vaccination were far far more likely to develop cervical dysplasia and pre-cancer. 

>To do a viable study you would need 1000 people injected with the vehicle exposed to HPV

In the ideal scientific environment, you would expose them. They don't for obvious ethical reasons. They used randomization of the subjects to account for HPV exposure. If both groups are random, they both should be exposed to HPV at similar rates.

> How can you possibly do a double blind?

They used real vaccines which had non-identifying labels between the two groups. (the actual HPV vaccine in one group, Hep B in the other group)

>The vaccine has been out for ten years: how is it possible to know the lifetime effects?

The HPV vaccine (and many variants thereof) has been under evaluation longer than 10 years. We can see the risks of cancer and pre-cancer already decreasing in populations that have been given the ~~drug~~ vaccine. In the 10 year RCC follow up, they specifically looked at rates of carcinoma in situ and cervical dysplasia in patients who recieved the vaccine compared to patients who received a non-HPV vaccine placebo. There were significant histologic (cellular changes under microscope) and gross pathologic changes observed between the two groups, not to mention the patients who recieved the HPV vaccine also didn't have to deal with the same rates of HPV warts/lesions. 

>If they knew all this at the beginning, why did they only vaccinate girls? Isn't that unethical, putting men at risk? 

I don't know the real reasons, but I know that the vaccine had the most evidence of benefit for women, not men. Thus, the ""lazy"" person's mentality was only give it to girls, cause they're the only ones who benefit from protection. Obviously vaccinating men cuts down on transmission rates. However, it's now very evident that the vaccine also directly benefits men as well. HPV is linked to penile and rectal cancers in men; however, these cancers are less prevalent in the human population than cervical cancer. So, TLDR, there was push at the beginning, I don't know why they waited so long to adopt the general recommendations, other than more evidence. There was mechanistic evidence for population wide benefit. 

>Is it not in our best interest to have independent watchdogs in a scenario where people's lives are in the hands of multinationals?

Yes, very much so. We probably need more of them. They also need to talk to each other more. Groups like Cochrane reviews as well as  individual medical organizations (like AMA, AAFP, AAP, etc.) and separate government commissions (like the FDA or USPSTF) usually release their own scientific opinions and explanations for practice guidelines. Case in point, the USPSTF approved the HPV vaccine for young men in America way before the British Joint Committee did.

Even educated adults in numerous situations still make bad choices.

Then you go on to Gardasil and its campaign to... push drugs?  Vaccines aren't drugs, that alone shows a severe ignorance and agenda on your part.  A vaccine is an inactive virus intended to produce an immune response.  It's the bumper bowling of the medical world.  You encounter countless viruses and bacterias daily, your body either has antibodies to fight them before they take hold, has passive countermeasures (nose/ear hair, ear wax, etc), or combats an infection creating new antibodies for use later.  Vaccines exploit the third method to create long term antibodies.  Not a drug.

And I am also okay with Gardisal pushing their vaccine as long as it's effective, something I haven't seen you show any evidence to the contrary.  It's made by a corporation that needs to get their investment back and make a return.  I go to work every day where I invest my time and hope to make a return on that investment.

is it? it changes a lot... dsDNA viruses, such as HPV need different surface proteins than say a +ssRNA virus... because they need to get to different parts of a cell. Meaning their capsid structures have to be different, meaning the proteins they code for have to be different... It's not that hard of a conclusion to make...

that's what the Baltimore system is a way to determine genetic viral structure, which dictates the rest of the structure... because, again they all have different methods of reproduction and have different requirements for what they need and where they need it. "

""Assigned male at birth"" is only relevant as a descriptor if there was a question, at birth, as to which gender should be assigned. If all male sexual organs are present, the description should be simply ""biologically male"" when attempting to have an objective dialogue of the situation. Bringing the SUBJECT's gender dysphoria (that's still what it's called in the DSM) into the conversation adds SUBJECTIVE ambiguity that does not serve the conversation.

2329,"The answer I think /u/DJWalnut was looking for was for whether we know why some places get more cancer than others, which is a variety of things. To an extent, it is just a matter of more cells multiplying and therefore undergoing a potential mutation event which may lead to cancer (this happens in most epithelia, as it is generally dividing more than other cell types because they get eroded due to things passing along conducts or for mere protection against abrasion, as is the case with stratified epithelial cells), and in some part it is because of exposure to nocive stimuli such as melanomas due to sunlight, naso/bucopharingeal cancer due to honestly whatever, and even some viruses (which either make cells multiply more or shut down defenses against cancer, I think this is the case with HPV but don't quote me on this).

Think that every moment, millions of wannabe cancers are being produced in your body and your body is protecting you against them. So where more wannabe cancers appear, more can thrive, and where those defense mechanisms can fail more, more wannabe cancers will appear. "

2346,"I am not responding to what he ""could"" have meant, I am responding to what he ""did"" say. And what they did say, in short, is HPV impacts natural flora. Both of my sources suggest otherwise and that the opposite is true. HPV is impacted by natural flora.  

>""As it happens, HPV affects the vaginal flora in a way that is recognizable and specific to HPV, while it manifests much more latently in men.""'

In fact OPs original statement doesn't make much sense at all. They made make two claims. The first one, HPV affects the vaginal flora in a way that is recognizable and specific to HPV, is what we are debating. I have shown evidence as stated above... HPV infections are impacted by natural Flora, not the opposite. He*could* have meant that genital warts on Cervical or Vaginal wall tissue can be more obvious, and that is true due to the nature of those tissues. But that is not what they stated. They  may not be 100% certain on what natural flora actually is. 
I would also assume, if I were to try and interoperate what they meant, that maybe he is talking about a pap smear being used to diagnose warts in women, and no equivalent treatment in men is available. Which, isn't necessarily true, as you can biopsy a wart on a man. 

The second claim they make is ""it manifests much more latently in men""... Which I don't think they know what latent means. Men get genital warts just like women. Perhaps they meant they were not as visable? I don't know. But this claim makes no sense if you look at it on it's face. 

> It does not predict in any way whatsoever particle composition. 

Yeah it does... because again. The method the viral particle uses (the proteins it expresses on it's envelope or capsid) to get in the cell and go where it needs, are entirely dependent on where the viral genome is replicated.
In the Case of dsDNA(HPV), it has to get to the nucleus, and the surface proteins it expresses have to ""convince"" the cell that the virus is worth taking to the nucleus. Otherwise it will fail to reproduce. So it predicts that particles will have to be made in such a way as to properly facilitate proper reproduction. "
2347,"

My point is that it is ludicrous for the medical and scientific community to completely redefine gender and sex identities for the purpose of scientific dialogue when medically and scientifically, how they ""present"" (i.e. how they CHOOSE TO PRESENT THEMSELVES) is totally and unequivocally irrelevant."
2348,"As I said before. This vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting HPV. It prevents the strains from hijacking regulatory mechanisms that prevent unchecked cell proliferation. The fact you contracted a strain that it doesn’t cover isnt surprising at all. If you, however, are insinuating you contracted a strain not covered, then got cancer all before you’re finished studying for nursing school (presumably under 30) that is hard to swallow. 

"

It's a shame that I've met people who use that statistic to both not get the vaccine and/or throw any safty out the window regarding sexual partners cause ""I probably already have it, most people do"". Hell, I've had it technically when I was a little kid (wart on my foot). It's like herpes in a way. Cold sores are technically herpes... but that doesn't mean you should throw caution about genital herpes out the window. 

And glad to see the risk of looking weird by typing out cancer-fairy paid off! Haha. 

I'm glad that people are becoming more aware of HPV though. Maybe one day the vaccine will include all the cancer causing types. Or even come out with something to help with current infection "

2352,"That's fair enough. But I would hope sexually active 13 year olds aren't having sex with anyone who has HPV. Unless it's possible for a mother to infect a child during pregnancy? If that's the case then I guess a teenager can have it without ever having sex, but if that's not possible, then yeah I would imagine young teenagers aren't having sex with anyone with any kind of std."

2386,Haven't we been giving this to boys in the US for a long time now? I got this YEARS ago.
2387,"I'm surprised that isn't already the case. HPV is the most common STI in the world.  1/4 American women have it and probably just as many men, we just don't test men. HPV vaccine is one the most well tested vaccines we have. The most common one out in the US at least is a nonavalent vaccine that covers 90% of cervical cancer causing HPV strains and covers for genital warts.  HPV vaccine is currently given to male age 9-21 in the US and is recommended  up to age 26 for immunocompromised or men who have sex with men. If you get the vaccine between 9-14, you only need two doses. You need three doses after that age.

Oropharyngeal cancer is going to be a leading cancer from HPV in men and women. HPV causes penile and anal cancer in men. And genital warts. It is detectable through DNA testing of tissue used in pathology reports although there are no current recommendations regarding screen in men like there are for women.

Everyone should get the HPV vaccine if you are within the age group it should be given to. It doesn't cause promiscuity, autism, infertility, allergies, or strike fear of Cthulu into your heart.  It is the only vaccine we have that actively prevents cancer. It is the biggest cancer prevention public health campaign of the 20th/21st centuries after smoking cessation for lung cancer.

For Americans, if you are a male between 9-21 or female between 9-26, it is covered by your insurance under Obamacare. Go get it for yourself and your future spouses."
2388,"I see this as a major failure in medicine. HPV is super common, something like 80% of people that were over 26 (it doesnt work too well if youre older) or male when the vaccine came out have it. Sounds crazy and unreal, right? That is because there are some strains that dont really do anything and even the ones that do sometimes dont manifest--or they manifest later in life, that is a nice conversation people who dont understand this virus can have with their SO. Regardless, the vaccine does work for most people and if you look at stats of women who were vaccinated, the new cases dropped by a lot.

But it dropped in women, how is that a failure in medicine? Well, just because men dont usually (will discuss this in a sec) get the cancers associated with HPV, doesnt mean they dont get the warts and other unpleasant things that come with the virus. Sure, they arent life threatening, but again, think about the stigma and psychological stress associated with a wart--keeping in mind that this is still a ""shame"" in our society, despite the 80% figure I mentioned above--and also think about every doctor visit that has to happen because of those warts (what do you think is the most common procedure your college campus student health center does? Those giant liquid nitro tanks arent for keeping the place cool.). 

And coming back to another point, men do get HPV related cancers. Why dont HPV related cancers generally affect men? For the most part, men do the sticking, not the receiving. There is a sizable sub-group of men who do the receiving from time to time too...gay men. If you look at these populations, they do get HPV related cancers with a larger incidence.

I dont know the reason why this was originally a girls only movement--and yes, as someone who grew up seeing the commercial and ads, this was a movement targeting young women. I do hope most medical  organizations and colleges/universities revamp their recommendations/requirements in the future though."

2396,"A sad reality - The government only cares when you cost them money. 
If it’s cheaper for them to immunize you in the long run, then they will do it. "
2397,"I had to say I was gay in Canada to get it, after I had a run-in with HPV that inflated one of my tonsils like a balloon and I had it removed at 24."
2398,I’m so glad I’m finally getting the vaccine. Going in for my next shot in a couple days. Such a breeze
2399,It's been a few years since I read about this vaccine so I'm a bit out of the loop. I thought the vaccine only protected against certain strains of HPV(the strains that cause cancer in women but don't produce warts). Is that still the case?
2400,"In the states this issue is so polarized its frustrating to read anything for it because neither side approaches it in a calm way.

The pro-vaxxers don’t acknowledge Gardasil putting girls into anaphylactic shock and settling out of court, they don’t acknowledge that vaccine settlement courts are a thing and exist, or whether there may or may not be potential dangers in so many immunizations in short period times as the number of recommended vaccines has gone up enormously.  They also fail to remember the hundreds of times big pharma has knowingly sacrificed peoples health for a buck and that the agencies that approve these are swarming with big pharma execs.

The anti-vaxxers... I don’t know do they just pretend polio and smallpox never existed? Denying the benefit of vaccines historically is ludicrous and bewildering. 

But the dialogue is never about this, you’re either against every vaccine or pro every vaccine.  God forbid people be rationally minded and say ‘Can we approach this on a case by case basis?’ 

The stories aren’t that black and white either.  Mom vaccinated her kid, got autism.  Mom didn’t vaccinate, got polio. Mom vaccinated her kid and they’re healthy.  A very er.. spiritually minded friend of mine didn’t vaccinate her son and raised him vegan. He’s 3, you’d think he was 6.  His rate of growth is huge.  Crazy smart too. Is him not being vaccinated related to that? I don’t know.  Anecdotally you hear stories of parents who raise their kids vegan and they’re malnourished because they didn’t know what they were doing. 

Both sides need to stop being so sycophantic.  We as people have no idea how to have different viewpoints anymore.  Just my perspective on this.

2405,My mom made me (boy) get the vaccine when I was in my teens.  Unfortunately the shot comes (or used to come) in 3 parts taken each a few months a part. I got the first two but never finished it out with the 3rd.  I wonder if I messed it all up or if I have immunity 
2406,"It's already offered to boys in the US. Honestly it's less about the effects of the virus in men and much more about preventing them from transmitting it to females...certain subtypes of the virus are carcinogenic in women. 

In my experience the vast majority of adolescents opt to get the vaccine if you explain that to them, and if they understand it's not harmful to them. "
2407,I got this with obamacare like 4 years ago. How is it not ubiquitous?
2408,This is bullshit for the pharmaceutical companies to make even more money.
2409,"There's not a single double blind study that shows this vaccine is an efficacious preventative measure for cervical cancer. 

None. 

Merck has run the most egregious scam on public healthcare dollars worldwide. 

Edit:  this vaccine costs almost 1000usd for the full dose, may have gone up since then.    This money can be funneled into treatments that actually improve public health efficaciously for that kind of money. "

2420,"I've been watching this issue for a while as I've an interest in men's health.

I hadn't heard about the connection between HPV strains and cancer in men until about 5 years ago. Up until that point it was given to women only in some countries as the was an established link with cervical cancer.

It was an economic decision by various governments not to extend the vaccine to men as well with the counter argument being we should be aiming for herd immunity to protect more women from cervical cancer. I imagine a counter counter argument at the time would be that exposing men to a medical intervention that was of no direct benefit to them would have been unethical."
2421,"Why is it a debate? Because certain groups of people:

A: think that there is a massive conspiracy being perpetrated by vaccine companies whereby the preservatives (or something else) in the vaccine are causing autism or some other problem. 

Or 

B: think that if you aren’t “promiscuous”, or if you are careful, you can somehow magically avoid being exposed to HPV. 

My last boss told me that she wasn’t going to get the HPV vaccine for her teenage son because he should be able to figure out if a girl has it, and if he sleeps with her and gets it, then it’s his fault. 

That’s the level of stupid we are dealing with here. "

2423,"Haven‘t read the article, but if such questions arise in countries with decent healthcare, it‘s almost never about whether they are allowed no get it or not, as soon as safety and indication are given, people can get it - the question is if it should be mandatory for health insurance to cover it."
2424,[removed]
2425,"It's an NHS cost to benefit calculation that's changed with the evidence.

First of all it's important to understand HPV was thought to be symptomless for most. 

We knew the virus caused some warts, but vaccinating a population for the minority that got them was not cost effective. 

When the vaccine first became widespread it was specifically to target and prevent cervical cancers. Once it was proved to cause cervical cancer we gave it to everyone with a cervix.

In men was still thought to be symptomless for the majority.

As the risk factors in men for certain cancers have been revealed it's now understood to be worth vaccinating them too.

We might have worked this out much sooner, but funding for the NHS is increasingly stretched and has been since 2010. Front line services take priority and research studies take a back seat.

More money in the NHS could have got the right answer sooner."
2426,I thought I read something about it only being available to girls for some reason and I recall being really confused.
2427,"I'm 32. I was about 19-20 before I even heard about HPV (other than herpes we all know and love), or what it can do. My girlfriend was getting the vaccine, and I asked if I should get it too. The doctor at the time said that it wasn't really for men and that they didn't have enough if guys started asking for it, so she suggested against it. 
"
2428,That's not consistent with everyone though
2429,I think I got my 3 series like 7 years ago now and if I remember correctly I got it pretty soon after it was approved for boys and men.
2430,This is a requirement for all members or the military.
2431,"> Everyone should get the HPV vaccine if you are within the age group it should be given to.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but this has more to do with sexual activity than a magical age cut off, right? The idea is that those are the years people are the most exposed to multiple sexual partners and if you're past the age it's more likely that you've already been exposed? If you're not very sexually active (haven't been with many partners), I don't understand why they don't encourage getting it past that age as well? Is there another reason why the ""cut off"" is 21/26? 

I had mine done right at 26 (which is generally around the time it came out) and remember debating not getting it because of that, which looking back I think is stupid. I hadn't had many partners and I'm glad I got it. I just don't understand why they don't encourage it after that age. I suppose at this point it's already encouraged to be done at a much younger age so maybe it's not really an issue anymore?"
2432,Why is it my doctor told me there is no HPV vaccine for men? 
2433,Is there any benefit of this if I am monogamous 
2434,Why don't be vaccinated after 26? I'm 28 and would love to get it. 
2435,">There is a sizable sub-group of men who do the receiving from time to time too...gay men

There's a whole subculture among them of receiving and transmitting certain viral infections. They don't give a shit. The risk of getting anal cancer by having a certain lifestyle is the same or bigger than the chances of getting cancer from smoking, for example, but you only see campaigns against smoking, not against bug-chasing and its variants. 

> I dont know the reason why this was originally a girls only movement 

Because girls actually matter in the long run. Men are pretty much disposable."
2436,Men's health really isn't a concern in our society...
2437,The initial push on girls came because we learned about HPV leading to cervical cancer in 1980s.  Cervical cancer was the leading cause of gynecologic cancer deaths in women and is a very painful cancer.  We didn't learn about HPV causing other cancers until the recent decade. 
2438,That was the initial push.  Current campaigns are more diverse.  It also happens the current Congress critters could care less about women's health.
2439,"The idea was that if no women get it then men get herd protection and less chance to get it too, it was chosen as women because they have risk of cervical cancer too"
2440,"It's worth it to check if you are over the age of 27, and interested in the vaccine. Insurance still covered it for me and I was 29."
2441,"Is it everywhere in Canada? I remember in Ontario when I was looking into it, it wasn't covered unless you had sex with other men. My uni subsidised the cost regardless but it was still too expensive for me at the time.
"
2442,"Guys can get it too.  After an unfortunate experience with a girl who was sub-clinical, I ended up getting the series, just to make sure.  Was well worth it."
2443,"Even if it does nothing to men. Making more of the herd immune makes it harder to spread, so fewer women would catch it from Male carriers "
2444,"I believe they've found a link to some male cancers, but either way, men can carry it and infect people too. Giving it to men and women would have a much greater effect."
2445,"Well, [there's lots] (http://www.hsj.gr/medicine/human-papillomavirus-and-cancer-in-men.php?aid=17877) of studies regarding the topic. While we can't detect it in men, we CAN grow make tissues and organ samples in a lab, infect it with HPV cancer causing stains, and record the data and outcomes that happen with those samples to accurately conclude what is causing what. I'm also fairly certain that those cancer types will have a slight structure that acts like a signature id of the virus that caused it, though I could be wrong there as I never worked directly in a lab, but did work within a Biotech company. The best course of action is to blanket vaccinate all males possible, vaccinate negative females, and then directly target positive females with potential cures to eradicate the virus. "

2468,"Virtually every sexually active adult has acquired and cleared multiple strains of HPV. Most people never knew they had it. Over 90% of the population clears the virus in two years or less. The problem is with the people that don't clear the virus quickly. It can lead to growths that can become cancerous. These can occur in the throat, cervix, and penis most notably. 

If you are one of the unlucky people that develop cancer from the virus, you will be miserable. I promise you that."

So, he got lucky, but many kids who get measles go blind or deaf or have permanent scarring from it. "
2476,I didn't mean I was allowed to get it YEARS ago. I meant it was covered AND suggested all boys get it YEARS ago.
2477,Uk and decent healthcare?
2478,"It was definitely a case of being ""Allowed"" for me. I went to get updates on all my shots about 5 years ago (when I was 26) and was told that it doesn't work for males and that the age out for the shot was 18 even for girls. 

They even looked at me like I was a pedophile. Most of us guys know what look I'm talking about. So I dropped the issue and haven't looked into it again. Nice to know some people were able to get the vaccine though. "
2479,"No one knows how old you are now dude.

I also got mine at 16 about 9 years ago. Getting my regular shots or whatever and they just offered it, asked my mom and they did it. "
2480,"Hah, I knew there was some upside to this! Haha........."
2481,We’ve known for a long time that it causes cancers in men from studies in MSM.
2482,"We didn't give it to everyone with a cervix, they gave it to young teenagers with them. I wish they'd give it to other people though. It could be done as part of the smear test and get everyone vaccinated. "
2483,"From my understanding which isn't much at all...

When it first was announced it was for like four strains, and they were giving it to only girls as they hit puberty. As things have progressed they've expanded inoculation, but yeah the first round of millennial males never received it as part of standard kid/school shots."
2484,Your doctor is retarded. Get a new one.
2485,"Unfortunately this was true for a lot of men at the beginning. It was only suggested women get it. Which is really stupid, but everyone that is around 16 now is suggested to get it

I don’t know why doctors were stupid about it at first"
2486,"The idea is that by 30, you probably have contracted all the strains already and the vaccine won't help you anymore. HPV is wildly common. The original Gardisil shot protected against 4 strains. I believe the new one protects against 11. I personally think everyone should get it if they haven't (unless you never plan to have sex again). Even if you have been exposed to some strains, you likely haven't been exposed to all of them. "
2487,"Mostly because it has only been tested in those ages, so the FDA has approved them for those ages in the US and your insurance will cover it only for that age. That being said you can go out and get the vaccine at any age. It's effects diminish as you age due to less robust immune system and the assumption is you have already had too many sexual partners that the new vaccine won't protect you against it. The reality is not that simple. The HPV vaccine is being tested for therapeutic trials for multiple cancers. The influenza vaccine makes you less likely to die from the flu, it doesn't prevent it. HPV vaccine may work the same way where you are more able mount a better immune system then you could on your own/ "
2488,"You are correct, the other reason is that those were the ages of men the initial studies were restricted to. The idea being that you catch people and vaccinate before they become sexually active. We also know that your response is less robust the older you are. For example, people below age 15 need two doses, people above age 15 need three. 

We may very well see this age restriction change in the next decade or so. The vaccines are being used in therapeutic trials for cervical dysplasia to see if it can change the standard of care which is surgical procedures to prevent formation of cervical cancer. "
2489,"Maybe he got it wrong? There's no test for men, but the vaccine works for both."
2490,Your doctor is misinformed. [https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine.html](https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine.html)
2491,">KiwiPe

Theoretically, no. We know that HPV is an STI and is only passed through contact. That being said, if you are within the age where it is recommended like other vaccines, I would go ahead and get it. "
2492,"You can get it, you would just have to pay out of pocket. "
2493,honestly the Congress is more full of people looking for personal benefits than those who actually do their jobs 
2494,"Maybe? but they dont check. Nurses even tell people ""just say you are gay"" (actually I think its just ""do you have anal intercourse"") Then you get an injection that normally costs 800 canadian, it will prevent HPV that causes cancer, and 90% or wart causing HPV. "
2495,"My son got it as a scheduled vaccine at the age of 11, with a booster at 12 I think"
2496,Do you know if they recommend getting the series if your wife was positive for HPV?
2497,Makes sense. This is just way more info than what my doctor told me. 
2498,"You may have already been getting at this, but the herd immunity thing is another reason to vaccinate males. "
2499,"I agree with this 100%. If this caused cancer in males as well, I’m pretty certain there would be more push for this. "
2500,That's alot to some people. 
2501,"Yeah I know I should get it, I'm missing some other vaccines too due to my parents not giving a shit lol. 

But my local doctor's office says I can only get them during a certain time of year when they do it for kids/babies? I always end up forgetting and missing the deadline. "
2502,Tell me how I'm wrong.
2503,"yeah, if it was theyd want everyone to get it. But all honesty everyone should get it anyway."
2504,"Thank you for your response Merck.  However it's intellectual dishonesty.   A norm for the firm it seems. 

There's some logical leaps that the whole the vaccine
reduces the occurrence of CIN, that doesn't mean it will reduce the occurrence of cervical cancer.    It's still not proven that CIN are the certain precursor path to cervical cancer,  or that the CIN's that are not prevented by the vaccine are the most likely to become cancerous. 

It's similar to the nonsense of lowering LDL.  So drug companies charge 13,000 for PCSK9 inhibitors.  But turns out reducing LDL does very little to reduce the risk of an MI.  Much like Statins where when you step back and look at overall morality and morbidity,  there's no difference.   

In fact to make money drug companies need to peddle relative risk versus absolute risk which is just modern day statistical snake oil.   When you further factor in risk of side effect and cost patients would be better served untreated. 

Edit:  your not going to find a study that shows a statically significant result of reduction of cervical cancer by the way.    Then again maybe we can just set alpha values to .5 so Merck can hit quarterly results. "

The only way to get rid of them is to basically burn them off with lasers which could leave a nasty scar around the whole head of your penis. With a possibility that they would grow back they aren't contagious, but imagine the conversations I have to have with girls every time I pulled my dick out. 

I can't imagine doing anything down there so drastic like freezing or burning sensitive skin. Holy s***"
2511,"I have one single growth that’s been on my penis for 6 years now, I wish this thing would hurry up and clear already."

2514,"Got little warts on my penis, went to doctor, had them removed in a very simple procedure then they were sent to the lab for analysis. "
2515,Is there any point for me to get vaccinated at this time?
2516,[deleted]
2517,Yea I got my HPV series like 5 years ago. Those were the most painful shots I’ve ever gotten 
2518,"Generally rated some of the best in the world.
"
2519,"I do agree with that.

It's a vaccine, not a cure. (again on the calculations at the time, some people do reduce symptoms with the vaccine.)

The rate of infection in the UK for 20-24 year old women was 40% before the vaccine.

Reducing the rate of cervical cancer in the otherwise unvaccinated by potentially 60% seems worth it to me.

That's about 1200 cases per year, 360 extra lives saved.

The question is, could the NHS save more lives (young lives too) by spending that money in another area. It's certainly possible.

I'm certainly glad I'm not the one making those decisions."
2520,Yup I'm that age. Makes sense.
2521,Which sucks because a lot of men weren’t protected. They should have just given it to everyone when it first came out
2522,"But by 26 I'd still only had sex with 4 or 5 people and a few of those people were virgins. So I really doubt I'd contracted that many strains, if any. I'm not trying to be some kind of purist or weirdo about it but I think u/HoneymoonMassacre makes a good point. "
2523,"It was several years ago.
Perhaps I'll go see a new one? "
2524,So it’s more the risk that you will sleep with new partners and then be at risk. I’m not in the age range so doesn’t matter for me but would like to understand
2525,"I'd just rather not have any warts pop up. But at this point I doubt that's going to happen  if it hasn't already (am not going to be sexually active again until in a committed relationship, also not MSM) "
2526,True but they find ways to stick in weridly hateful misogynisc things also.
2527,Do you go to the hospital or the walk in clinic? I'm 25 and want to squeeze in before my birthday. 
2528,"The sexual health clinic I went to recommended it.  However, I'm not sure what effect exposure time to treatment time has on whether or not that decision is made, or what strain of HPV you have been exposed to.  I found it soon after exposure that it had happened, had developed some lesions, but those lesions didn't test positive for any of the nasty forms of HPV, only a benign strain, so they went ahead with the series with me, along with appropriate treatment to remove the lesions.  They haven't come back either."
2529,There's many strains of HPV so I would imagine it'd still be recommended. 
2530,There's a large push for it. You just don't hear about it getting reported in mainstream outlets much unless you follow a lot of medical journals and studies or work within the industry. 
2531,"There is evidence that it does in some cases. Even if it didn't, eliminating HPV is a no brainer, let's kill it for good!"
2532,"It’s a lot to me too, but cancer treatment costs something like 20-100k and I’d rather not deal with that. If you’re super high risk, get a loan if you have to. "
2533,"Tell me how you're right? You're not, so we can start there, but tell me how you figured out that treatment plans, surgery and extended care are somehow less expensive than a 2 dose shot. I would love to see this new kind of math."
2534,Because if you don’t get this simple vaccine you run a decently high risk of eating pussy then getting throat cancer. Sound fun? No? Get the vaccine.
2535,"So we have double blind, placebo controlled data showing that the vaccine:

- prevents infection with the HPV strains that account for more than 80% of cervical cancers

- demonstrates an ability to reduce CIN and AIS (FDA approved surrogate markers for prevention of cervical cancer)

- similarly reduces rates of dysplastic lesions linked to HPV infection and cancer in a number of other settings for boys and girls

- has long term follow-up, open-label data similarly suggesting that the vaccination prevents cervical cancer

But sure. Go ahead an believe that it doesn't impact cancer risk.

Also, fyi - alirocumab was recently shown deemed cost effective by ICER."
2536,No sex is biology and gender is psychology.

2541,"I did the dick freezing thing at home, wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be."
2542,"That’s nothing to do with a sexually transmitted disease and is super common, some just slightly more visible then others. When I was a kid probably until 18-19 I could see them. Now I can’t even notice them. Dick pics weren’t HD at that point but never had anybody notice. Like I say with years of hard fucking and a busy sex life it’s almost like they just wore off. Don’t even stress about that"
2543,"From what I read, the ones that produce visible growths are just unsightly. They don't usually turn into cancer. You should probably get it checked out though. "
2544,Get it frozen off. 
2545,"Yeah, get it frozen off. It's not even that bad, I promise you dude."
2546,"You're assuming you only have one strain...

the VAST majority of people have no idea they have it. They also don't / can't / wont test for it in men."
2547,You think the vaccine gives you cancer? Any studies to back that?
2548,"Methinks perhaps you don't understand how vaccines work, it would benefit you to find some good medical resources and read up on how they function :)"

2550,I won't engage with non-scientific nonsense.
2551,"Lol a huge portion of your posts are from /r/conspiracy . Take the tin foil hat off, live a little. You aren't important enough for the entire scientific and medical community to want to give you HPV. Or maybe you're so bat shit bonkers your are, I don't know at this point."
2552,Your edits make you look like a wanker.
2553,Honestly yes. At any point is better than not getting it. 
2554,"Insurance covers men under 26 I believe. If you haven’t had a lot of partners I would suggest it. If you have had a lot of partners, the odds of you been exposed to the bad strains go up accordingly and therefore the vaccine won’t help you with those strains."
2555,"Uhm... Vitamin C doesn't cure viruses. Your own immune system will usually clear it on its own. That's like binge watching ""Friends"" when you have the fly, getting over the flu, and then telling everyone that ""Friends"" cures the flu.

No children have died from the HPV vaccine. It's safe, and millions of people have gotten it. Me included. The only symptom I had was a tiny amount of soreness at the injection site for the rest of the day for each shot. 

The link you sent is a fund for people who have allergic reactions to vaccines. Vaccines are made out of compounds like anything else. This is the equivalent to someone eating a strawberry and swelling up. A tiny percentage of the population is allergic to those compounds. If you are one of those people, you should not get vaccinated. The same applies that if you are someone who swells up when you eat a peanut, you shouldn't eat peanuts. For the rest of us, vaccines, peanuts, and strawberries are perfectly safe and healthy. 

They track the ACTUAL numbers on this. Out of 25 million vaccines administered, 33 people had serious allergic reactions. That means your chances of having this reaction is 0.000132%. (roughly one out of 750,000 people). This is why they encourage you to stick around the doctor's office for a half hour after getting one. If you had one of these reactions, they can reverse it with an epi pen instantly, but it could be hazardous if you were not near any medical care. 

Now compare that with your odds of dying from Chicken Pox (1 in 32,000) or getting hospitalized from it (1 in 330). Your odds of getting pneumonia from Measles (1 in 20). The odds your baby will die if it contracts Whooping Cough (1 in 125,000). In 2000, around 550,100 people worldwide (mostly children) died from Measles. This is a fact. A widespread vaccination initiative was launched that sent vaccines worldwide, and we have brought that number down to 89,780 in 2016. This isn't zero, but they saved nearly a half a million lives a year with vaccines.

Edit: I think I'm just a bit salty about it because I am an age where growing up I was told that smear tests should begin when you're sexually active but then they changed it so I couldn't have one until I was 25. I understand why that happened but it meant that a lot of my friends were sexually active for upwards of a decade before they were able to be checked for cancer etc. It just feels like I've been in quite an unlucky age group and I suppose that's what I'm complaining about. "
2562,"Yeah, but each of those people may have had sex with 4 or 5 people in the last two years, and each of those people might have had sex with 4 or 5 people. 

I agree with you. I think everyone should get it. The new shots have 11 strains in them. Even if you did get exposed to a couple of them, there's no way you got exposed to all 11. It still confers some protection. "
2563,"Yeah, that was pretty much my experience. I'd been with three guys, two of which had been virgins (and the last guy had only had one other partner), and I was thinking I was too old to get it. I wish that they would have explained it better at the time."
2564,Only :O I'm 30 and I had sex with 1 person
2565,“Only 5 people”? You almost certainly acquired HPV long before you got the vaccine.

The control group for Rogaine even regrew hair. So, if you truly believe it works, it will give you a benefit, and, as far as I know, your body can tolerate ridiculous amounts of vitamin C without any harm.

> This study reports that women with a prior diagnosis of cervical HPV and their male partners are at high risk for subclinical oral HPV, as indicated by the presence of the virus in the oral cavity in 20.4% of female and in 30,7% of male. The pooled prevalence of oral HPV-infection in women with cervical HPV-infection obtained from a review of the literature 1990–2016 was 10% (European average) and 12.9% in Italian studies. This is significantly higher than that reported in the general population of women without cervical HPV-infection.

> The same trend emerged in male samples: pooled published data gives a positivity of 14.5%, whereas the present study found double this rate (30.7%). This might indicate that genital HPV-infection is a predisposing condition to oral HPV-infection, in both women and their male partners. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously, and larger cohorts must be tested via multicentre and longitudinal studies to clarify viral transmission to/from the oral mucosa.

My fiancée is going to make an appointment with our GP to discuss further since obviously an obgyn is specialized in women's health and not men.

So unless youve put your mouth on his ass (no judgment), youre good in that regard. So he'd mainly have to think about oral cancer.

Yes. HPV integrates itself in to the host cell's DNA, and as it does so, it deactivates a mechanism that kills cells with damaged DNA.

[Yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncovirus). Messing about with the normal functioning of a human cell is kind of central to how a virus works, so in a way it's more surprising that most viruses manage *not* to cause cancer.

> what else don't i know!

1. Some bacteria can cause cancer too, either due to chronic inflammation or due to the chemicals they secrete.

2. A few non-human mammals suffer from *actual* transmissible cancers, in which cancerous cells descended from one individual colonise another individual."
2751,"Yeah most cancers are caused by a cell accumulating several genetic changes (usually due to environmental factors).

The virus produces proteins that effectively mimic some processes in a cancer cell (promoting uncontrolled cell growth). Most people get this virus, and most clear it pretty quickly. For those that don't, the infected cell over 5-10 years has a substantial chance of accumulating the other genetic changes needed to progess to cancer.

For example if a cell needs to gain 7 genetic changes to become cancerous, the high risk strains of HPV  mimics two of these so the cell now only needs to acquire 5 more changes.

My general response would be “the NHS does not have infinite resources and has to take a risk-based approach to mass preventive measures”. 

So. on to the specifics:

> Sorry but that's easy to say if you don't have HPV. HPV causes penis, anus, mouth and throat cancer in men.

The risk of cervical cancer to women with HPV is much higher than the risk of those cancers to men with HPV. That’s why they previously vaccinated girls only, it had a much higher return on investment. 

> I don't think that at all actually, I think this is a pure cost saving measure and it's simply wrong. 

That’s a fair opinion. Good thing they’re changing it in that case. But presumably you’re in favour of indoctrinating everyone in the country, to every disease possible? The NHS should not deprioritise anyone for cost reasons, ever? Rabies and Japanese encephalitis shots for 70m people, because giving it to some people because they are at higher risk, and not others because they are at lower risk, is a cost saving measure that is simply wrong. 

> It is still discrimination and it means some men will get HPV and therefore cancer when it was easily preventable.

> It's easy to say 'oh you get 90% of the affect' when you aren't in that 10% who catch it.

Yes. People will get cancer that could have been prevented, if the vaccine was given to everyone. That is not a unique situation with the HPV vaccine. The NHS does not have infinite resources and has to take a risk-based approach to mass preventative measures. 

> What...? How's that even relevant, the fact you've been upvoted for this garbage just shows what I was talking about in my initial post.

Men can get breast cancer, that’s how it’s relevant. 

Males and females have different physiologies that create different medical priorities and risk factors, therefore they are sometimes treated differently in terms of the treatment that is given to them. If you do not screen every male for breast cancer, some men will die from breast cancer that could have been prevented. If you are not in favour of the NHS giving every man a mammogram, then by your own logic your are participating in sexism and discrimination that is simply wrong. 

I think people were up voting that because it shows up your position pretty well. 

> If this were the other way around, are you seriously telling me that certain users here wouldn't claim it was sexism?

If it was the other way round, I’d personally be curious to know why, because of the higher risk profile for girls than boys, that has been mentioned already by several people.

Is your point about the incorrect application of cost-benefit analysis for the NHS, or is your point about people on Reddit? 

If it’s the former, then calling this sexist because males and females are not treated identically in medical procedures is idiotic. Back to my example of breast cancer screening. 

If it’s the latter, then yes I’m sure there would be people here calling it sexist. I agree, some people are kind of dumb and don’t think things through. I don’t know what the rest of your point is after that, I don’t know what your argument is. "

They do say prevention is better than cure.


> The NHS should not deprioritise anyone for cost reasons, ever? 

Sure of course, but we are talking about a few hundred quid per person for lifelong protection from HPV and HPV related cancer and only teenagers.

> Rabies and Japanese encephalitis shots for 70m people, because giving it to some people because they are at higher risk, and not others because they are at lower risk, is a cost saving measure that is simply wrong.

Yeah but both those things are low risk of infection whereas HPV is incredibly common. This argument might make more sense in a world where HPV has been near eradicated. If rabies was common here then yes, I would say we should vaccinate.

> Yes. People will get cancer that could have been prevented, if the vaccine was given to everyone. That is not a unique situation with the HPV vaccine. The NHS does not have infinite resources and has to take a risk-based approach to mass preventative measures.

I know that, I am well are due to personal circumstances. However, there is money for IVF and other things which aren't strictly health related.

> Men can get breast cancer, that’s how it’s relevant.

Yeah I know that, you can also get a scan but the the risk of males developing breast cancers are significantly less. The risk of catching HPV is the same weather you are male or female. So just not comparable and therefore irrelevant.

> I think people were up voting that because it shows up your position pretty well.

It doesn't though.

> If it was the other way round, I’d personally be curious to know why, because of the higher risk profile for girls than boys, that has been mentioned already by several people.

Higher for developing genital cancer, I should think that the risks of oral and throat cancer is just the same, plus the disease does actually have a fairly major symptom that isn't cancer.

> Is your point about the incorrect application of cost-benefit analysis for the NHS, or is your point about people on Reddit?

I can't speak as to the cost benefit analysis as I am not privy to it, my point was about people on reddit. However I am of the view that other countries offer the vaccine to girls and boys so I don't see why we need to be different to save a few quid. Especially when we fund IVF.

> If it’s the former, then calling this sexist because males and females are not treated identically in medical procedures is idiotic. Back to my example of breast cancer screening.

Not what I am saying at all.

> If it’s the latter, then yes I’m sure there would be people here calling it sexist. I agree, some people are kind of dumb and don’t think things through. 

Glad you agree.










"
2773,That's an entirely different matter. You'll get a mammogram if you show signs of breast cancer obviously. You won't get one just because you want one.
2774,">There would clearly be an improvement to the health of the UK population from genderneutral
vaccination. **The key question for JCVI has been whether the additional benefits
gained from extension of the programme represent a good use of NHS resources.**  It is
important that the finite resources of the health service are used to maximise the health
of the population, and this is the key driver behind consideration of cost-effectiveness.
JCVI uses NICE HTA methodology according to its terms of reference in its
consideration of cost-effectiveness.

>There are clear health benefits in vaccinating boys. The data considered by the
Committee show that the HPV vaccine is both safe to use in boys and generates
comparable immunogenicity to that seen in girls. It is clear that a programme to
vaccinate adolescent males would provide those vaccinated with direct protection
against HPV infection, and associated disease including anogenital warts, anal, penile
and oropharyngeal cancers. A gender-neutral programme would potentially provide
optimal protection to men who have sex with men (MSM), by offering vaccination
before the age of sexual debut.

????

Again, it obviously would benefit men to have the vaccine. Nobody has disputed that. What you still don't understand is that ALL medical procedures in the UK have the exact same objective, mathematical test applied to determine whether or not they are **COST EFFECTIVE**, and giving this vaccine to men fails to meet the exact same criteria that every other medical procedures needs to meet to be funded by the NHS. 

ANY medical procedure needs to meet the same criteria or it won't be funded. This isn't about your feelings or about equality, it's about the most objective (and fair) possible measurement of the potential benefit in relation to the cost, to maximise the benefit produced from a limited amount of money."
2775,"I’m not doing the back and forth thing any more. The risk of catching HPV itself isn’t the real problem that is trying to be stopped, it’s the resulting cancers.

We’re going in circles. 

Yes men have equal chance of catching the virus, but the virus itself is not as statistically harmful to them. So what is the point you’re actually trying to show here? If you can’t speak to the cost-benefit analysis, then I don’t see what you’re saying at all anymore. 

You started off with “people would call it sexism if it was the other way round”, which would be dumb for them to do so. Just as it’s dumb to call the present policy sexist. Which is what that first guy did, and you backed him up."
2776,How much does it cost to treat a single case of cancer? How much is the vaccine?
2777,"> The risk of catching HPV itself isn’t the real problem that is trying to be stopped, it’s the resulting cancers

I'll just point out that it isn't just about cancer and genital warts there is also something called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis where you get them in your respiratory system and can cause difficulty breathing.

All in all, I think it's worth spending the money to wipe out this virus in 50 years time.

> Of which women are at higher risk. Cervical cancer is the highest cancer risk from HPV

This article says different though

In any case, even if that is the case you will still get a number of men who get cancer from HPV when they could have had a simple vaccine.

>  It wasn’t sexism. We’re going in circles.

I know, it was about money... I already said that.

> Yes men have equal chance of catching the virus, but the virus itself is not as statistically harmful to them

I don't think you've demonstrated that and as I said, why should anybody be getting perfectly preventable STD's for the sake of a couple of hundred quid injection? We spend £16k per could per IVF attempt on the NHS, with something like a 20% success rate. If that can be justified then so can this.


> You started off with “people would call it sexism if it was the other way round”, which would be dumb for them to do so. Just as it’s dumb to call the present policy sexist. Which is what that first guy did, and you backed him up.

I agree, I don't think it is sexist, I just think it's penny pinching. If you read that article it seems at least in the US that men are 4 times more likely to get throat cancer than women and because there isn't any screening process that exists for precancerous cells in the oropharyngeal sites the tongue, soft palate, tonsils, the throat behind the nasal cavity but there is for the cervix. Even if you are a woman with HPV there's a good chance that Cervical cancer can be treated early with regular smear tests. Even though we have that screening I still think vaccination is a better option, for everybody.

2785,"> They hold treatments hostage and refuse to supply them because they don’t think a human life is worth the cost of the treatment

This is fantasy world nonsense, sadly. There is a limited amount of money available to the NHS. Do you spend it on treating 10 people whose quality of life will vastly improve and they'll live to their old age, or do you spend it on treating one person who will get an extra 5 years of suffering? Genuine question, please answer it.

And then - how do you make that decision? Do you treat whoever pulls the tabloid readers' heart strings the hardest? Or do you get scientists into a room, try to objectively quantify the benefits of each treatment in relation to the cost, and then apply the exact same test to both treatments?

Condoms protect against most STDs, exceptions are herpes and syphilis (the latter is pretty rare, and you will spot the sore/rash), also if you have pubic hair, crabs. However, they are not always 100%, especially as a lot of people don't use them correctly.

2797,"Oh damn. :( I guess I’ve just gotten lucky since I had a recent check up and got the all clear. I don’t remember anyone ever teaching me that, we’re always just told in school to use condoms and you’ll be safe. Thanks for the info!"
2798,Based on what? So if I have sex I'm just automatically likely to get HPV? I remember hearing somewhere that the likely hood of getting HIV from a blood transfusion was still lower than 50%. Is there any good information on how likely a HPV infection would be from a single sex act? 
2799,It's even less of a risk if someone with herpes is taking antivirals and using condoms. 
2800,"You may get hpv from sex but it causes 0 symptoms and 0 negative effects for you. This is the most likely scenario. It is very common.

You may get a cancerous strain, which causes 0 symptoms and 0 negative effects. Or 20 years later you get unlucky in that <1% and get cancer. 

There are no statistics on transmission rates but people who are sexually active are at risk. If a person has the hpv vaccine series completed then transmission is reduced around 90% effectively making cancer likely as winning the lottery.

The only concern is if you have symptoms. It can only be tested if it appears cancerous, in males.

The safe assumption is if someone is sexually active, they have good odds of having hpv. If they are a virgin, the odds are lower but they can still have hpv. You can look up those stats but they are high. "

The gardasil vaccine would only protect boys from some forms of genital warts and maybe potentially some forms of oral cancer (although it is not known for certain).  And so a nationwide vaccine platform involving double the required production would not have been worth it.

And people can say “oh are boys lives not worth money anymore?” All they want, the money saved on each and every project is still in the NHS budget and will no doubt go on to save lives.

The HPV vaccine has been linked to a number of medical issues.

The gender that benefits most is females and it was quite controvercial when it was first used since they wanted to use it on boys for the benefit of girls. The idea that it could also protect boys only came later.

Only about 60&#37; of girls actually take the vaccine. Others refuse.

It is not clear cut if it even benefits girls at this stage. It has only been around for about 15 years.

It should be given to boys if they want it free of charge but the risks should also be made aware to them. I personally would not take it."

>Similarly, allowing boys to get cancer and treating them for it is more lucrative than supplying a vaccine that would prevent this type of cancer.

We don't actually know if it works yet, and there are issues with side effects."
2853,"I wouldn't call it highly effective unless your goal is to simply prevent HPV. Even then, there's been quite a few payouts due to the vaccine. Sure, you can say that it helps a lot more than it harms, but HPV is pretty benign to begin with in all but the rarest of cases. Harming a few to help a few is pretty questionable.

Going through every source I found I can't find any statistics on HPV causing cancer. Cancer.gov claims that 70% of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions are caused by HPV which is pretty astounding. On the other hand, WHO reaches the 70% conclusion based on a combination of cervical cancer and precancerous lesions. I'm inclined to believe that the WHO is more accurate, yet still dishonest since it combined two different statistics. Precancerous lesions are not cancer, they just might become cancer. On the other hand, WHO cited no sources at all. 

It's typically agreed upon that HPV is found in most cervical cancer. To most people this appears to say that HPV causes most cancer, but that isn't necessarily true. Remember that around 70% of people will get HPV and almost nobody will get cancer from it. It's reasonable to assume that HPV is unchecked or at least less inhibited in people with cervical cancer. Correlation vs causation is difficult, and simply assigning the blame for something so rare is innately dishonest. 

Similar tactics are used for traffic related statistics to buff up numbers. An alcohol related accident just means that someone involved had a detectable level of alcohol, even if they were a passenger, pedestrian, or the victim. Marijuana is said to be related when THC is detected in the blood of someone involved, using the same criteria as alcohol, but with the bonus of THC remaining in the system for up to a month while the high lasts only a matter of hours.

What I'm getting at is that HPV related cancer statistics are very fuzzy, and fuzzy statistics are as useful as a foam hammer to people who aren't pushing some sort of dishonest agenda. 

I'm sorry for not giving you a more straight answer. It's been a while since I really dedicated myself to studying HPV and I'm just not all that inclined to go through the effort of relearning all the ins and outs. I did read your linked article, both now and when I originally researched the HPV vaccine a couple years ago. It's one of the reasons I became skeptical of the vaccine, it made the fuzzy statistics apparent enough for me to take notice of it."

“Elimination of infections: Reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate efforts; continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required. Example: measles, poliomyelitis.”

In big cities in the west, something like 10-20% of MSM in big cities have HIV, and half don't know.

Now it's approved for both males and females. Eh. My views are complex.

3122,"Babies aren’t given adequate pain medication if they’re given any at all and their circumcisions involve the highly painful process of the foreskin being ripped from the glans (retraction has already happened in adults).

I would never put a child through that. Even if they won’t remember the pain later, they’ll still feel it. I don’t know about you, but I could be offered 1) surgery with severe pain experienced during with no memory after or 2) normal surgery with no pain during but pain after with drugs for it, I’d take option 2. I don’t want worse pain even if I won’t remember later. I’ll still experience it once, and that’s too much. If my sons want to get circumcised as adults instead of wearing condoms (which would be dumb, because that barely works, if at all) that’s up to them. At least anesthesia and pain medication after is more possible then.

Do you really think the memory of pain is worse than feeling it at the time? Maybe you do, but I certainly don’t. I’m not suffering now for having a memory of horrific wisdom tooth pain. I suffered then, and that was worse.

Male circumcision is accepted by pretty much all sunni and shia sects, and recommended by most. In all muslim-majority countries, the majority of men are circumcised. This is true among Arabs, Punjabis, Bengalis, Javans, Persians, Malays, Pashtuns and Turks. Most circumcised men in the world are muslims, though local traditions and practices around it vary.

Other major circumcising groups are Americans, Jewish people, South Koreans, Filipinos. It is also common in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa where circumcision has recently been promoted by the WHO.

I don't really see what ""x amount of people do it"" is relevant. Even if 100% of boys in the world had it done to them, it would still be wrong. How widespread a thing is, is irrelevant to whether it's right or wrong.

>I don't care

And yet you posted, and continue to post."
3135,"No I said *Medical Scientist*, not a black man"
3136,I sure did. But the question remains
3137,"Is the question about incest now? Personally, I would have gone with Bangyourcousintown instead of Bangyoursisterville. If you check a [map of Bangyourcousintown](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_marriage#/media/File%3AGlobal_prevalence_of_consanguinity.svg), you'll find a lot in common with the prevalence of circumcision map. Of course, some people outside of Bangyourcousintown get circumcised and plenty of people in places where circumcision is uncommon bang their cousins, but the point remains: Most people outside Bangyourcousintown don't practice circumcision. "
3138,I’m not totally sure what argument you are trying to make — that somehow because circumcision and cousin marriage share a cultural denominator in Islam that that is a good argument against circumcision? You know what else correlates with those? People who abstain from alcohol. So clearly being sober leads to circumcision right?
3139,"FYI, banging your third or fourth cousin [seems optimal](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/02/08/couples-who-are-third-or-fourth-cousins-have-more-kids-grandkids-than-other.html), at least if you live in Iceland. And one round of outbreeding undoes any amount of inbreeding. So banging your cousin is not completely ridiculous.

Don't know what this has to do with circumcision, though. It seems to be a coincidence that Muslim communities tend to do both."
3140,"Most people outside Bangyourcousintown don't practice circumcision. It comes down to ethics and the right to self-determination. The civilized, develop world where there are laws against cousin marriage and whatnot (because it's unethical to birth children that are the product of incest) is populated primarily by people who don't practice infant genital mutilation (because it's unethical to remove healthy tissue from a person unable to consent). 

Civilized, educated populations at least attempt to behave ethically, as a culture. They often go as far as passing laws to ban unethical behaviors. Some cultures are slower than others (like America, where child marriage is still a thing in many places), but most cultures aim to be more ethical. 

And ethical people who value the individual's right to self-determination are disgusted by mutilation of nonconsenting infants."
3141,...I thought it was already given to boys as well because it protects then from some kind of throat cancer.
3142,"It has just been agreed in The UK for boys to get access to the Vaccine. Inmany parts of the world the Vaccine is ok only given to girls as male vaccination and protection from cancer and other risks is seen as unimportant. Men, including G.A.Y. men, are seen as lesser and not worthy of the expense. "
3143,"I always wondered why only women were told to get the vaccine. It doesn't make sense, if the men are the carriers... Also, I wish guys would just get tested for STI/STD. Women have to get tested at least once a year at their annual."

3153,"Encouraging parents to vaccinate boys too helps everyone. It helps the boys, it helps any future girlfriends or wives or boyfriends or husbands they might have, it strengthens herd immunity for everybody, it's just a good idea."
3154,"HPV is a global issue .... But many only know local issues. It's the same with PrEP (Prexposure Prophylaxis) where many assume that as it prevents HIV transmission bare sex is safe again. Only problem is the emergence of antibiotic resistant Gonorrhea, Syphalis and more, as well as the growing number of viral vectors."
3155,The US
3156,"Yea, I know. Neither of those things mean that they thought 'men were lesser', they just messed up. They were trying to save money, and they always end up pushing medication on girls instead of boys  even though it makes no sense. Over here, they did the same thing, but they've since realised it was stupid and are vacinating guys as well. This has nothing to do with 'thinking men are lesser' imo.

And yeah, they forgot all about gay people.. D: "
3157,"Which is something I still don't grasp in people. Just because one disease vector is eliminated doesn't change the fact there's multitudes of reasons to wrap it up, only go bare with people you trust, and also test regularly if at all possible."

3191,"You can get it even with the vaccine! There are *so* many strains of HPV.  The shot only covers the cancer and wart causing ones. (Still 100% worth it to get the shot, don't get me wrong). 

The other strains you don't get vaccinated against generally resolve themselves within a year though and most people never show symptoms. It's just one of those things that people get and since guys can't really be tested for it you just have to cross your fingers and hope they're part of that 20%. Lol

I had the shot when I was younger and still got HPV. I'm one of the unfortunate people who couldn't fight it off though. I ended up having to have a surgical procedure called a leep where they burn off parts of my cervix to ensure the abnormal cells didn't return so I wouldn't get cancer."
3192,"It is asymptomatic (not asymptotic, that is maths) in most people until it is not. That point can be years after the original infection. A PAP-smear is looking for irregular precancerous cells that only occur after a chronic hpv that has lasted years. "

Fast forward many years, and a routine pap turned up HPV and weird cells. I had a LEEP, and my last pap has shown no more HPV (yay!) but still weird cells (boo). 

I'm too old for the shot now, so it looks like I'll just be on 6 month paps for the next forever, and I'm going in next week to find out more information about the weird cells and if I'll need another LEEP. Lady parts are so fun."

Theres always pushback from certain corners, especially when it involves a something that can be linked with sexual behaviour.

Vaccinating everyone would have been 1st prize, but the likes of the Daily Mail would have made that more difficult than it should have been. Just look at how the Daily Mail has reported on HPV in the last 5-10 years. Its only in the last couple of months that it has started making the issue into some kind of culture war...."
3223,"I commented on this thread already but thought I'd respond to this too. I worked on rolling out the vaccination programme when it first became available. 

Basically, there are strains of the HPV virus that cause cervical cancer and actually cause most of all the cases of cervical cancer that happen. Therefore there was a really strong reason for girls not to get any HPV. The vaccine isn't about stopping people getting an STI, it's about preventing cases of cancer in an organ only women have.

The infection rates of HPV are massive. If you're not vaccinated before you've become sexually active, you most likely have the virus. Most strains don't result in any actual warts and the ones that do are less linked with cancer. 

When rolling this out, there was an insane amount of backlash from parents thinking this would make their children more sexually active. It was a huge, huge undertaking just to get that through for the reason of preventing cancer, not for the reason of preventing people getting an STI. 

Yes, there are perhaps some reasons to vaccinate boys, but I'm not aware of the specific issues HPV creates in boys, the scale of it and the mortality issues. Those things might come to light at some point and there might be shown to be a good reason to vaccinate boys too. 

But yeah, important to remember this is about cervical cancer and saving lives of people who just happen to have a cervix, not about stopping you getting warts. :P"
3224,">The Daily Mail wants people to be angry because it suits them. Don't fall into that trap of being manipulated into rage.

Yeah, somehow I think they wouldn't care quite so much about this if they weren't using it as a way to attack both the NHS and feminism. See also their comments on funding for breast cancer vs prostate cancer.

3251,What did they say about breast cancer vs prostate cancer that you think is untrue?
3252,"Because the vaccine was originally rolled out to reduce rates of cervical cancer. Boys don't have a cervix, so...

But yeah, since then, there may be a good argument for introducing it for boys as well. That was probably less understood back when this was developed. I worked on this in 2008 (10 years ago) and this was on rolling it out. This meant the vaccine had been developed, everything was prepped, we just had to get it out there.

So the decisions about this would have been made probably a fair few years before then. From a brief glance, the understanding about HPV's action in causing other cancers has happened since then. 

This is my own personal observation, not anything I heard whilst in the NHS and public health, but if you vaccinate girls, then it would prevent the vast majority of girls AND boys from having or passing the virus around. It does obviously leave gay men out of this equation, but I think it's worth acknowledging that the vaccination for girls will have also had a positive impact on the majority of boys too. 

But yeah, just to reiterate, my original point was just that there was no anti-boys conspiracy when this was rolled out. It was more to point out the spin the DM was putting on this story. If a throat cancer charity wants to challenge the NHS on this, then fair enough. Let's see how they get on. "

Other countries vaccinate both genders so it doesn’t seem outlandish to suggest that we should do the same. Vaccinating girls will give some level of protection for boys but not the same level as actually vaccinating them.

It’s not that I’m saying there’s a rampant anti-boys conspiracy but the connection to throat and mouth cancer has been known since at least 2007.

Wasting a lot of resources on something which has a small effect will ensure those resources are not spent on something more effective.

The mortality rate for both cancers is pretty even so I don't think you can say one kills more than the other.

There is no evidence of this. I explained this the last time you and I bumped into each other.

The link you provided talks about Dr. Diane M. Harper who helped create the vaccine and continues to study it's safety and efficacy.

I explained to you what her concern was and you just linked to a letter that confirms what I told you before.

Here is a more recent study with her as the lead author: [HPV vaccines – A review of the first decade]( http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0090825817307746)

>Duration of antibody response is critical for clinical prevention of HPV infection. Cervarix has high anti-HPV16 and HPV18 antibody titers for at least 9.4 years [15] in longitudinal follow-up studies; Gardasil has plateaued anti-HPV16 titers well above natural infection titers for at least 9 years, but anti-HPV18 titers that are not different from natural infection titers as early as 24 months after vaccination [16].

And there is a problem with how she measured titres...

[Brief Report: Antibody Responses to Quadrivalent HPV Vaccination in HIV-Infected Young Women as Measured by Total IgG and Competitive Luminex Immunoassay]
(http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/2017/06010/Brief_Report___Antibody_Responses_to_Quadrivalent.14.aspx)

>Abstract: We compared antibody responses of HIV-infected young women to the human papillomavirus (HPV) 6, 11, 16, and 18 vaccine using total immunoglobulin (Ig) G Luminex immunoassay (LIA) and competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) assays. HPV18 seropositivity after HPV vaccination as measured with IgG LIA remained high (98%) 48 weeks after vaccination, in contrast with seropositivity as measured with cLIA (73%). Seropositivity rates at week 48 as measured by both IgG LIA and cLIA remained high for HPV6, 11, and 16 (93.5%–100%). **These results suggest that the lower rate of seropositivity to HPV18 when cLIA vs. IgG LIA is used is a function of the assay and does not imply lower vaccine immunogenicity.**

In essence, not only does she admit that the vaccines are still highly effective after 10 years (the total time now available to study), the one concern she has about decrease in seropositivity has been shown to be based on a flawed test."

I think you're mistaken and if you can't find it, you should stop saying it.

What I have found many times, is that men are less likely to become seropositive to a natural infection - not the vaccine. This is fairly well known. Men have more infections, carry them longer, but have fewer cancers.

The rest of that comment is what is known as an anecdote. It is one person's story that may or may not be reliable and may or may not provide any evidence of causation.

Example:
10 kids go to a birthday party and are served cake and milk. You hear from one of the mothers, that a bunch of the kids got violently ill from the milk because it had been left on the table all day and spoiled.

The facts may be quite different.

First, you weren't a direct witness so it's hearsay.

Second, ""a bunch of the kids"" is nonspecific and subjective. Was it 9 or 2?

Third, ""violently ill"" is subjective and non specific. Did they have diarrhea? Did they go to the hospital? 

Fourth: all we know is that there were 10 children at a party and cake and milk were served. We don't know what caused an illness - if there was an illness. Did they all eat the same thing? Did they eat anything else - for instance, did they also have crab salad?

Here is an equally likely scenario: the 10 children are all from the same school or neighborhood and several of them have been exposed to the same virus that coincided with the day after a party. 

Every time a group of people are exposed to a virus at the same time, a significant portion get sick at the same time and it always coincides with another significant event in someone's life. Always.

3368,I wonder if the vaccine be given to males in the future. 
3369,"To the person who was suggesting that the HPV vaccine caused the death of ~100 girls in the US (their comment seems to have been deleted):

Linking adverse events to an intervention in a post-marketing setting is tricky. We know from clinical trials that there are no large imbalances in serious adverse events between vaccine and control groups. [See table 29 of this report](https://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4222B3.pdf).

The CDC [has a comment](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv/hpv-safety-faqs.html) related to post-marketing observations of serious adverse events:

> Some deaths among people who received an HPV vaccine have been reported to VAERS. This does not mean that the vaccine caused the death, only that the death occurred after the person got the vaccine. CDC and FDA review all available information on reports of death following all vaccines, including HPV vaccines.

> From June 2006 through September 2015, when about 80 million doses of HPV vaccine had been given out in the United States, VAERS received 117 reports of death after people received the Gardasil vaccine. Among the 117 reports of death, many could not be further studied because there was not enough information included in the report to verify that a person had died. In 51 of the reports, CDC reviewed medical records, autopsy reports, or death certificates and verified that the person had died. After careful review of every reported case of death that has happened after Gardasil vaccination, CDC concluded:

> There is no diagnosis that would suggest Gardasil caused the death

> There is no pattern of death occurring with respect to time after vaccination"
3370,Is HPV widespread in the US? I'm 23 so should I get vaccinated or nah ?
3371,Australia too. But ignore anything from us it's all just propaganda.
3372,I wonder about the effectiveness in the antenatal population.
3373,It wasn’t just Scotland it was the whole UK I also got this vaccination in 2009! 
3374,"Does Scotland have reliable adverse reaction reporting that one can look for trends or lack of trend changes, related to this change in vaccination program?"
3375,"Amazing!!! Treatment for a virus that spontaneously resolves over 98% of the time and, in the US, kills less than 5,000 annually. Meanwhile, the vaccine causes premature shutdown of ovaries, developmental problems and, hey, even death. And sure, let's give it to boys who don't even have cervixes, outstanding idea!!!"
3376,They already are! Pediatricians offices in America offer this to male children regularly. Doesn't mean the parents are giving them to the kids. 
3377,Males up to 26 can receive the vaccine. It's in three doses just like in females.
3378,Yes! Should be given to both males and females to further reduce the spread of HPV. In males there are also penile cancers and cancers of the mouth and throat associated with HPV as well as genital warts.
3379,"In Scotland they certainly are, I received them in high school."
3380,I had my son vaccinated for it.

Even though not all of these cases lead to cancer, if I was your age and had the opportunity I would get the vaccine. "
3385,"Around 50% of sexually active US adults will have HPV at some point during their lives. In most cases it doesn't lead to cancer though, but it can still spread even if you don't show any symptoms from it."

3388,"> kills less than 5,000 annually

I'm gonna say that's probably wrong since it causes 4,200 deaths via cervical cancer alone. That's one third of all women who get cervical cancer actually dying from it.

40,000 HPV related cancers per year."
3389,">Treatment for a virus that spontaneously resolves over 98% of the time and, in the US, kills less than 5,000 annually.

Wrong on both counts and I can actually provide evidence to back it up:


>[Studies have shown that more than 90% of new HPV infections, including those with high-risk types, clear or become undetectable within two years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV is the most important risk factor for cervical cancer precursors and invasive cervical cancer.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html)

Just under 40,000 cases of HPV related cancer per year with something like 10,000 deaths (see other response for links and calculations),"
3390,"I had to force my mom to let me get it, she kept bringing up junk science."
3391,Most Insurance will cover it up to 26.  But if you don’t mind paying out of pocket it’s safe for men over 26 to take the vaccine.
3392,"An HPV vaccine was also distributed to 6th grade girls here in BC, Canada with similarly strong results. They're just now rolling out a vaccine for boys as well. "
3393,"It's frequently misinterpreted (willfully or through not understanding its limitations). Same for FAERS. That said, I still think it is important to maintain a public record for reported adverse events."
3394,"If I was your age, i wouldn't bother with the vaccine as the CDC numbers show it affects less than 0.017% of the population as far as fatality rate ... you have a better chance of choking on a piece of steak at dinner."
3395,"I've never seen a study with an estimate that low and I think you might be confusing your statistics.

What' I've read is that between 70 and 80% of all sexually active people will eventually get at least one HPV infection and between 45 and 48% have an **active** infection (meaning they are infected right now)."
3396,"I'd much prefer a national adverse reaction report, than a study. Studies can be great or they can be terrible, but most studies of safety of for-profit products, such as the HPV vaccines, are funded by the manufacturers and dubious at best. "

3398,"You can say it's wrong but those numbers come from that place called the CDC ... meaning you're wrong, The threat of HPV is grossly overinflated. Again, it seems you and many others here are google challenged. 4200/year ... Do you even grasp the significance of how SMALL that number is? 16,500 people die per year because of NSAIDs use, 20,000 died from opioid overdose. Cervical cancer has an incidence rate of 0.0013% in the United States, are you able to grasp how LOW that number is relative to other far more pressing issues? I gather not from your response. You have a higher risk of dying in a car accident, 40,000 died last year ... that's 10 times the risk of death from driving. 323 million people in the US and 4,200 die per year from HPV and the vaccine MAY prevent the cancer, MAY, read the insert. It also MAY cause death or disability. You'd have to be completely inept or even stupid to not understand the risk is NOT worth the benefit. "
3399,"Right, the CDC is wrong. And no cite for your ""facts"" still ridiculously stupid. 98% resolve spontaneously AND deaths due to cervical cancer, that's ALL deaths due to cervical cancer is 4200. 0.0013% incident rate"
3400,I just had this conversation last week.  The reason that insurance doesn't cover after 26 is because you are less likely to have additional partners after that age.
3401,"Well, it’s not just fatality rate at issue though, right? Some strains of HPV also cause genital warts and it’s one of the leading causes of throat cancers too. Just because it doesn’t kill you doesn’t make it not worth avoiding, plus it helps cut the risk for everyone if more people get vaccinated."
3402,"If you did a quick search, you'd find you're wrong. "
3403,"Wow someone has a chip on their shoulder, aside from the fact *I* got the vaccine and not my imaginary children! I feel like you’re someone who probably also thought the MMR jab causes autism and is looking for a conspiracy to put. Scientists aren’t out to kill people you need to calm down. If the data is being suppressed it’s very unlikely to scientific community would be okay with that. 

Not only that you’re plain rude to someone you don’t know. I am not challenged thanks, I guess my degree in biology is just for the lolz. Thanks for the maths lesson ;) "
3404,"Why wouldn't you get a vaccine that literally can prevent you getting cancer? Sure the chances are low, but cervical cancer is definitely a killer (not to mention vulvar, throat, and penile cancers possible in HPV as well) And it can prevent genital warts too! Seeing as how HPV affects over half the US population, why wouldn't everyone get the vaccine? "
3405,"There are 40 strains of HPV that are sexually transmitted but only 14 that can cause cancer and only 2 that are responsible for just under 90% of all HPV related cancers.

Those 2 strains are very common. If 80 people of a 100 get infected with one of these strains and only 2% get cancer, that's still almost 2 people who have to have radiation, chemotherapy and surgery. 

You want to gamble with that? Be my guest."
3406,">You can say it's wrong but those numbers come from that place called the CDC ... meaning you're wrong,

If you got that figure from the CDC then post the link from the CDC that backs it up.

> Cervical cancer has an incidence rate of 0.0013% in the United States


4200 die of CERVICAL CANCER. **~40,000 people in the US get HPV related cancer**, The same number you quoted for dying in a car accident. If you think the vaccine is stupid, I bet you don't wear your seatbelt either. I don't know about the rest of you but I am on the road a lot more than I am having sex - the per-incidence risk is significantly higher for having sex and getting cancer from HPV than for driving and dying in a car accident.

Do you know why the cervical cancer rate is lower in the United States than it is in other countries?

>It also MAY cause death or disability

Where's your handy statistics course now?"
3407,"Right but there is a misconception that there is a medical reasons to restrict the vaccine.  And if you/your future partners might benefit then you should totally go for it if you can.

Just short of 40,000 HPV related cancers in the United States per year. Sure. It doesn't manage to kill them all. I'm sure they're all happily living with no taste buds and constantly dry mouth and throat due to radiation treatments and nerve damage and stomach problems.

No big deal right.

Oh, wait, what if it was just anal cancer or penile cancer, I guess that would affect one's throat, just their entire digestive tract or reproductive organ.

This is like telling a kid not to bother looking for traffic before they cross the street because even if kids do get hit by cars they usually survive.

Its a fucking vaccine, you moron.
https://www.cancer.org/cancer/oral-cavity-and-oropharyngeal-cancer/causes-risks-prevention/risk-factors.html
>The number of oropharyngeal cancers linked to HPV has risen dramatically over the past few decades. HPV DNA (a sign of HPV infection) is now found in about 2 out of 3 oropharyngeal cancers and in a much smaller fraction of oral cavity cancers. The reason for the rising rate of HPV-linked cancers is unclear, although some think that it could be because of changes in sexual practices in recent decades, in particular an increase in oral sex.

"
3415,"You would find that there is an abundance of data and research on the HPV vaccine that is NOT funded by the manufacturers of the HPV vaccine.

If you use the VAERS data to inform your decisions about getting a vaccine, you need to understand that anyone can submit any data they like. In fact, I suggest you do exactly as you suggest and take a look at what has been submitted by whom regarding HPV vaccine reactions. 

The database has been used by groups seeking payout for adverse reactions because in court, your lawyer counts more than evidence and data.

If you're in the United States then you know that compared to other countries, we are practically illiterate when it comes to science and math. The repercussions of this have grave consequences when it comes to vaccinations.

An inability to understand ordinary bias and its implications on judgement makes us a nation of emotional non-rational reactionaries. If you don't understand this then you are at risk of being manipulated by those that do."
3416,Where did you go to med school? 
3417,"

Calling someone stupid who actually knows what they're talking about is going to have zero effect. I can see the difference between rhetoric and science.

I had a statistics class, several, in fact. And many chemistry classes and biology classes.

More importantly though, I'm dying from cervical cancer and my cousin died of cervical cancer last summer.

"
3418,"Well I’m not exactly sure the details on how all the policies are made and executed.  But the insurance company picked that as the cut off.  I mean they have to pick some age.  100 years old does not seem helpful, 10 years old seams too young..."
3419,"Right, totally believe you. And my stats training crushes yours, there's literally 1 chance in a million your background even touches mine from the Science side. I didn't know the CDC was publishing rhetoric now ... found the pharma troll, 😀"
3420,I don't think they had to pick a cut off.  Men remain sexually virtile for most of their lives.
3421,"There are 40 strains of sexually transmitted HPV. 13 strains can cause warts. 13 strains are commensal (no ill effects at all). 14 are oncogenic (can potentially cause cancer). But of all those strains, there are 2 strains responsible for 90% of genital warts and 2 that are responsible for 90+% of HPV related cancer in men and 70% of HPV related cancers in men. 

The quadrivalent vaccine covered these 4 strains. 

These 4 strains are very common. Once exposed, the human immune system creates antigens to protect the body from reinfection thus, once the infection is past, reinfection is usually not possible.

By the time you're 27 years old, the chances that you've been exposed to at least one of these strains are pretty high and thus you're already immune to reinfection - or you're going to get cancer/precancerous lesions if you failed to clear an oncogenic strain. And although you may continue to have sex, you tend to settle into more monogamous relationships with less risk.

The insurance companies didn't pick the cut-off. The maker of the vaccine did. This was their recommendation based on studies done prior to and during creation of the vaccine.

The vaccine actually causes a better immune response than does the virus itself and exposure to the vaccine at a younger age provides a better response than when you're older - another reason to get the vaccine when you're young. Although, this honestly makes very little difference.

The virus doesn't just cause cancer in women. I don't know about Scotland but in the US, we're getting to a point where the number of HPV related cancers in men is about 70% of the number of HPV related cancers in women. It's around 40,000 cancers per year in the US.

There is a new vaccine that covers 9 strains of HPV instead of just 4. It's the same two that cause 90% of genital warts and 7 oncogenic strains that brings the potential number of oncogenic infections prevented up to 90% or better for women."
3422,Bet you're wrong. ;-)
3423,"I'm not sure if everyone here has noticed, but this is in **CANADA.**  Specifically, B.C. (all provinces regulate their own health care).  

Just to be clear.

edit: yay we got the title tagged!

edit2:  For all the people asking ""But I thought health care was free in Canada?""  - Only partially.  You can get a free doctor visit, free medical exam, and free surgery (paid for by your taxes).  But if they prescribe you medicine, you have to either pay out of your own pocket or have work-provided health insurance to pay for that prescription drug (yes we have work-provided health insurance in Canada too), or be on the welfare drug program which is not easy to get on.  

Vaccines are normally free, but only for children.  Apparently there wasn't enough pressure for the BC government to make the HPV vaccine free for boys.

If you are considering changing your country to universal healthcare, please do not look at Canada as a shining example, we have one of the worst implementations of universal healthcare:

3425,"There seems to be some confusion among people in this thread. I used to study male HPV vaccine uptake, so let me outline a few points and fun facts (though some of these have been mentoned already):

* HPV is the **most widely prevalent sexually transmitted infection**, and there are over 40 different strains of the virus.

* Numerous strains can **lead to cancer in both males and females**.

* HPV is basically the sole cause of cervical abnormalities and subsequent cervical cancer, so **HPV vaccination was initially targeted toward females**.

* However, **many cases of HPV are asymptomatic -- meaning there are no symptoms** despite the virus still being transferable. 

* At this time there are **three types of HPV vaccine** (male-approved vaccines in bold): 

    * Bivalent (protects against 2 strains, aka Cervarix; female only) 

    * **Quadrivalent** (protects against 4 strains, aka Gardasil; male/female) 

    * **Nonavalent** (protects against 9 strains, aka Gardasil-9; male/female)

* The CDC recommends the HPV vaccine for **all males aged 11-21** (although it is arguably most effective at ages 11 and 12). However the recommendation **allows for male vaccination up to age 26 in homosexual populations** (see 'MSM' below).

* The age limits are set by analyzing the vaccine's diminishing efficacy in the body, especially as males begin to engage in sexual activity (thus raising their chances of being exposed to HPV).

* Both Gardasil and Gardasil-9 follow a **three dose schedule** (meaning three shots). The second shot is typically given 2 months after the first dose, and the third shot is given 4 months after that.

* Scientists and public policy makers use complex mathematical formulas to try to extrapolate the cost effectiveness of vaccinating X number of males and females in the population.

* In 2013, about 34.6% of boys between 13 and 17 years of age had at least one dose of Gardasil. However, 52% of those boys did not complete the full three dose series.

* There has been some controversy surrounding the cost effectiveness of vaccinating males at all, because male HPV-related cancers (anal, penile, head and neck) are much less prevalent than cervical cancer in females.

* Many argue that **herd immunity** can be achieved without vaccinating the majority of males, because over time HPV will simply become less and less prevalent. However, **this argument does not account for MSM populations** (men who have sex with men).

* Also, MSM males are considered to have more risky sex-related behaviors than non-MSM males. This makes them more vulnerable to HPV, which is also a major concern.

* There is a widespread lack of awareness of the male HPV vaccine, so I'm very glad this is on the front page... if not to boost uptake, then at least to raise awareness and start a dialogue among the general population.


I can post sources, but not until I'm off work later today. Most of this information was collected from the CDC's website."
3426,I understand why the priority is vaccinating girls because HPV can lead to cervical cancer. But medically why is there a distinction between gay and straight males?
3427,"> Provincial Health Officer Perry Kendall has said there isn't enough money to provide the HPV vaccine for free for all boys. The government has said that with the majority of girls being vaccinated, heterosexual boys will be protected.

Um..... WHAT?

You have money for girls to get vaccinated, but not guys? How in the fuck does that make sense? Why not open it to both parties?"

3430,"I'm a heterosexual male, married and monogamous for 20+ years. I'm also a three year survivor of stage 3 squamous cell carcinoma in my throat and neck definitively caused by HPV 16/18. My multi-decade delay in illness following exposure to HPV is typical, and I've experienced no other symptoms. If Gardasil 9 or it's equivalent had existed and been administered to me as a kid I wouldn't have gotten this. Period. Also, instances of oropharyngeal cancer due to HPV are skyrocketing worldwide, and in the US in particular.
Obviously I survived, but not everyone from my support group and cohort was so lucky. Concurrent radiation and chemo beat the crap out of me and I'll be negatively affected with side effects from my treatment for the rest of my life. My kids, regardless of insurance rules at the time, will be getting the vaccine when they're old enough. While I feel that absolutely both genders should be covered under insurance (I'm American, so the Canadian specifics of the article don't apply directly to me) as a parent I'll do whatever it takes. I strongly recommend every other parent do the same.

3435,"I remember when the HPV vaccine came out. I asked my female doctor if I could get it and she said that it was only for women and that HPV doesn't really affect men. I then asked about how HPV can cause genital warts, and that affects men. She then explained that because I was already sexually active, that I likely already have it and dismissed me entirely."
3436,"Holy shit people, let's get some things straight:

- Men don't get cervical cancer but they can sexually transmit the viruses responsible just as easily as women

- Both genders can get genital warts from low-risk strains of HPV

- High-risk HPVs also cause a significant amount of head and neck cancers, the majority of which disproportionately affect men

This is not about sexual orientation or deciding who's at most risk.  Everyone should be vaccinated to reduce the spread of HPV and their associated diseases."
3437,"A lot of the literature on HPV suggests that its way more cost effective to provide the vaccine to females instead of males. Yeah it would be better if everyone got the vaccine, but the money for that has to come from somewhere. And if you have a fixed budget, it's better to spend that money on stuff like prenatal care, where you end up saving many more lives."

""What about HPV,"" I asked her, assuming she'd forgotten to mention they'd be testing for that too.

""Oh, we don't need to test you for that. You're male. You don't need to worry about HPV."" 

I was dumbfounded. This was before evidence had popped up showing that HPV was linked to throat cancer in men, but still... I am a man who has sex with women. Shouldn't I be tested for something that could put a partner at risk for cervical cancer? 

TLDR: My doctor taught me that I am only responsible for my own health and not anyone else's."

3442,"Oh, for fuck's sake. People in this thread without a shred of medical experience... There's limited funding. Unlike males, females more often get fatal CANCER from HPV. Yes, males should be vaccinated too (doing so would protect females too), but if you have limited funding you vaccinate the group that will benefit the most from it."
3443,lets just try fix half the problem

3445,"On a related note, is there any legitimate excuse for a heterosexual guy to get the vaccine?

3447,"Regardless of HPV's ability to cause different cancers at different rates in women and men, it doesn't matter.  It should be available to ALL young people, because it's simple herd immunity.  Women are more vulnerable, true, but who are they going to be having sex with?  Wouldn't it be nice if their partners were not carrying it either?  It's stupid not to want to get as many people vaccinated as possible if your goal is to reduce the overall infection rate."
3448,"It's expected that the number of oropharyngeal cancers caused by HPV will soon surpass the number of cervical cancers caused by HPV. The former kind of cancer predominantly affects men (~85% of cases are in men).

http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/ppt/hpv_cancer_graphs.pptx

Usually this cancer occurs where there is lymphatic tissue, e.g. the tonsils. The surgery to remove it is typically invasive, and the radiation therapy required often causes other kinds of cancers and prevents you from producing saliva in the mouth ever again. It's not something you want to get.

Please upvote for awareness on this issue, it was only recently discovered that this was the case (around 2006) and a lot of people aren't well aware of it."
3449,My female friend in highschool had to pay something like $400 for the HPV vaccine.  And this is in Ontario where we have OHIP.  I'm not sure how that happened.
3450,"A possible way to get it free for boys too is suggested in the linked article

So you just have to claim that the boy is questioning his sexual orientation. It's ridiculous but may work."
3451,"Mine was free...in the US. The shoe is on the other foot now, Canada! "
3452,"> Provincial Health Officer Perry Kendall has said there isn't enough money to provide the HPV vaccine for free for all boys. The government has said that with the majority of girls being vaccinated, heterosexual boys will be protected.

So...divert more funding to it? I know it's worlds more complex than this, but this seems like an important, common sense sort of thing, and I can't speak for everyone - especially since I'm not from BC - but I'd rather use tax dollars make sure everyone is vaccinated and protected than build a new playground or renovate a community center. Again, I know it's not simple, but I feel like something this important should be a priority.

Also, the ""Heterosexual boys will only be having sex with vaccinated individuals"" thing is BS. What about boys who are unsure and experimenting? What about boys who have sex with women who moved to Canada and were raised in other countries who didn't get the vaccine? What about boys who have sex with people in other countries where the vaccine isn't mandatory? What about boys who have sex with women who have to rely on herd immunity because their immune system is too weak for the vaccine? Just off the top of my head, there's numerous cases where that rationale doesn't make sense."

3461,"I'm a 40 year-old female and I have crazy cervical cells. Right from the very first time I went to the gynecologist, I was called back for second and third pap smears and/or biopsies every single year because of ""suspicious"" and ""unusual"" pap results. It was aggravating and extremely stressful, until someone thought to give me an HPV test and found I was HPV negative. 

Being HPV negative means that even though my cells in that area are wildly abnormal, I just don't have to worry about it. If I were in a relationship with a partner with HPV, however, I would. My kids - both my son and daughter - will be getting the vaccine. It's a shame any government or health plan doesn't recognize the value of protecting everyone from HPV."
3462,"> The vaccine is free for girls in Grade 6, but costs more than $300 for boys.

The vaccine is not free for girls, it is paid for by the government through taxes. It may or may not cost the government $300. The cost for someone off the street to *purchase* the vaccine would be the same regardless of their sex. "

3472,"Canada is supposed to be happy land.  How are those people making these decisions still oblivious to the fact that some ""gay"" people are actually bi or pan sexual.  Persecuting young gays like this damages ALL of their society and really nulls a portion of the effectiveness they are so sure of for the vaccine.  Also, I'm not disregarding the double standard here; free vaccines for girls but the other 50% of the population has to pay a steep fee?  How about $200 a shot all around since they claim ""there's not enough money to make it free for boys""."
3473,"Where the fuck do they think girls even get HPV from in the first place? If we don't vaccinate the boys as much as the girls, then the male population will perpetually be a viral reservoir.

He looked at me a little dumbfounded and say ""You know they're just bumps, right?"". Complete disconnect from reality.  

HPV can cause penile, anal, and throat cancers. Not to mention, even if its not harmful to the man, it makes him a time bomb for any unvaccinated woman he sleeps with. 

Besides, even if they were 'just bumps', who wants warts all over their dick?"

Comments like ""i doubt feminists care about this""

Does that mean that women have it worse in all areas? No.

OP's post is an example where men need a boost. This vacine should be free for men too, with out a doubt. But that does not mean we need to pick on and insult feminists. Thats not helping any one. Equality for all is the goal for every rational person. "

Its just ""free"" because your employer or insurance company pays for it as part of healthcare reform.

3525,"When my son had it done it was considered preventative and thanks to Obamacare was covered at 100% like all vaccines. So Obamacare > Canada at least in this instance!

However, personally, I don't think it should be given to boys at all. It has not been tested in males for safety or efficacy. Literally all the studies on the vaccine were done for girls.

There's actually a very good reason it hasn't been studied in boys:

http://www.thehpvtest.com/about-hpv/faqs-for-men/?LanguageCheck=1

""There is currently no FDA-approved test to detect HPV in men. That is because an effective, reliable way to collect a sample of male genital skin cells, which would allow detection of HPV, has yet to be developed. In October 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did approve the use of the first HPV vaccine (marketed as Gardasil®) for boys or men age 9 through 26 for the prevention of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11."""

I laughed in her face and said ""Nevermind, I'll just give women warts instead."""
3528,"I understand the ""protect whoever is most at risk""..... but how do you think they GOT the risk to begin with?  It just doesn't make sense to limit the vaccine to girls when it would BETTER protect them to offer it to both."
3529,"If men were vaccinated, it would take care of the problem, as they're the ones participating in ALL the types of sex that transmit it!

By vaccinating them, it would protect not only both genders from HPV, but it would also fix the problem without bringing up any taboo topics (Homosexuality is apparently a taboo topic in the ""real world"" AKA offline)."
3530,Doesn't HPV also cause warts?
3531,"Why is it not mentioned that the vaccine from 2009, which is the one licensed for both men and women. Lead to Multiple-sclerosis-like side effects in between 0.01% ~ 0.01% of the vaccinated. 
They returned to the older less effective vaccine, but with fewer cases of side effects, because of it.

3538,"Does your company provide a medical FSA? Most do these days, they are tax-free accounts you can set up through your benefits manager where you get a debit card and can spend up to $2500/year in uncovered medical expenses. The cash that funds the account is *pre-tax*, just like your health insurance, so this is money that you would never have seen anyway due to income tax. In some cases you can actually RAISE your take home if signing up for one of these gets you under a tax bracket. 

Anway $2500/year is a lot, the only catch is you have to use it all that year, it doesn't roll over. On the other hand, it can be used to pay for anything medical related, meaning all co-pays, all prescribed medecines, glasses, and a lot of over the counter stuff like heat wraps, contact lens solution, etc. *Edit* It can even be used to pay for things like gym memberships and the like - anything that improves or maintains good health. Most families can find a way to spend all $2500, especially of one or more family members wear glasses. Braces and dentistry covered too. 
  

 You can't get it to pay for things like aspirin and the like without a prescription, but if there is something you feel like you *need* that's in the list that is not covered and can get a doctor to *prescribe* it, then it would be covered after all, it just takes an additional form to fill out.

TLDR: Medical FSA ftw. 

Bonus: Childcare FSA: $5,000 in pre-tax money to go to daycare if you are the sole caregiver for a child and work, or if  both caregivers work. 

Look into benefits and tax incentives for everything. Turbo Tax (or a good accountant) are your friend."
3539,"A key ethical issue is that when you give someone a treatment it has to be in their best interest. Giving someone (especially children) a treatment with potentially dangerous side effects for the purpose someone else's benefit might make sense on a population level, but is actually ethically ambiguous. Is the risk of an anaphylactic reaction worth taking if you aren't ever going to benefit?

Now you can make arguments about it reducing the rate of penile cancer and that is fantastic, but you need to look at whether it reduces the rate of cancer enough to be considered a overall benefit to the patient.

Even if penile cancer is exceedingly rare, NONETHELESS boys/men are *disease vectors* who will spread the virus to women. For herd immunity to be effective, the vas majority of the entire population needs to be inoculated. Even those who themselves may not benefit from the inoculation, but could he asymptomatic carriers."
3573,"I'm from Argentina and it's free and obligatory for girls here, but I don't think they vaccinate boys. It's a real issue."
3574,The irony is that is was actually designed for and tested on men since men are actually the main carriers of HPV. The company couldn't convince men to get an expensive vaccine for a disease that only showed symptoms in women. The company then marketed the drug towards women. 
3575,HVP can cause cancer in boys and protecting both boys and girls would help limit spread more effectively than protecting just one.
3576,But why would he need to get it if he's 12 and a guy?
3577,"When you want to stop the spread of a deadly disease, you don't pick and choose who you vaccinate to prove a political point, especially when the the disease can be carried unknowingly. "
3578,My insurance covered it so my brother and I got vaccinated.  Three cheers for disease prevention!

3581,Hahahaha... I love stupidity. Just sit back and watch the fireworks ^(and cry on the inside).
3582,"So as a male who was unaware that there even was a vaccine for males.

* How would I go about getting this? (I'm in Norway; so it would probably be cheap / free)

* Is there a test to check if I have the virus already?"
3583,"My 12 year old got the shot during his before school physical. I'll find out the cost when the bill comes. :/ I told him what it was for and he said ""but I'm 12! I won't be having sex till college!"" Well, I hope that's true."
3584,"Hi kids, public health professional here.  I'd like us to take a step outside of the reddit for a moment to talk about HPV-related cancers.
 
[Every year, about 27k new HPV-related cancers cases are diagnosed.](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm)
 
[The current common HPV vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, can help prevent HPV-related cancers of the vagina, vulvar, and anus, as well as genital cancer.](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/sexual-health/in-depth/cervical-cancer-vaccine/art-20047292)
 
[It is not currently known if oral cancers can be prevented by these vaccines.  Until these are studied, interventions are focused on preventing an initial genital infection through vaccination which could otherwise lead to an oral HPV infection and subsequent cancer.](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpvandoralcancer.htm)"
3585,Free for women? Not my girls.  
3586,And women complain about making less than men 
3587,You don't half prevent a disease and its spread. You prevent it as much as possible or not at all. 
3588,She's 100% right. Both my daughters and my son got the vaccine.
3589,"On a related note, is there any legitimate excuse for a heterosexual guy to get the vaccine?"
3590,How does the vaccine work? Do you get the shot and you are good for the rest of your life? Same effect for boys and girls?
3591,"If schools aren't even going to teach about hpv, it should at least be accessible for everyone to get the vaccine. "
3592,"I have worked in public health since 2007, and I didn't even know boys could receive the vaccine efficaciously. Dammit."
3593,Wow I guess I didn't realize how helpful my insurance has been. I've never paid out of pocket for one. 
3594,"Don't vaccines work best with herd immunity? Should be given to everyone.

Otherwise we create the same consequences as the anti vax idiots."
3595,"Thanks for putting another divide between men and women. Thanks for making my job as a feminist, much more difficult.

This vaccine needs to be covered for everyone... just as you would polio/rubella/mumps/etc vaccines."
3596,"The problem with this is the admittance that their child will be having sex eventually, which is the problem that the HPV vaccine faced initially.  It's a dumb reason, but it's still valid in regards to making it mandatory."
3597,I wouldn't mind a free HPV vaccine as a male since I just heard that my chances of HPV derived throat cancer goes up 500% when I turn 40.  
3598,"It makes sense that they only inoculate girls. Vaccinations are considered a success when you achieve herd immunity, defined as a rate of inoculation is high enough to prevent almost all new transmission.

If you vaccinate almost all women for HPV then as an STD the only demographic further transmitting the virus is MSM (men who have sex with men) who make up only 1-2% of the public and aren't a symptomatic group. Even assuming every gay man was bisexual, 2% of the population is still too small of a transmission vector to break the general herd immunity."
3599,Hpv made my very active soccer playing son very ill.  Couldnt walk.  Ended up in a wheelchair for 3 months.  Now ok but still aome lingering problems.  Save yourself the money and the worst years you could imagine.
3600,"Just a side note, people realize this is taking place in Canada and not America right? "
3601,I live in Ohio and both me and my husband got the shots for free when we were in high school. I don't think this is common everywhere. 
3602,"It's shocking how dated so many medical standards are. Vaccines should be for everyone at a low cost for everyone, disease doesn't give a damn either way."
3603,So.... Booking in appointment with GP as soon as possible then
3604,Everything should be free says resistor who pays money for stuff
3605,I've been saying this forever. It should be available to both sexes. Its ridiculous that this even has to be debated. 
3606,"Are you from Canada?  Because if you are, it should be provided free under these situations:

The HPV4 vaccine is also provided free to males who are at increased risk of HPV infection, following these conditions: 

Ages 9 to 26 years of age who:  
have sex with men, including those who may not yet be sexually active and are questioning their sexual orientation;  
are street involved;  
are infected with HIV;  
Ages 9 to 18 years of age in the care of the Ministry of Children and Family Development; and  
Ages 12 to 17 years of age in youth custody services centers.

3607,boys can get hpv?
3608,can somebody tell me the odds of getting 
3609,"Its well worth the money. Yes, it should be free, but pay for it if you must."
3610,is there an equal chance of both boys and girls getting this disease and the cancer that goes with it 
3611,"I got a series of three shots, my insurance paid for the first two but then my birthday came up and I turned 26 or 27, had to pay $200 for that one."
3612,Is it not more dangerous for women (infertile due to HPV)?
3613,So can this be used as a cure to those infected? Or just prevention? 
3614,"still skeptical. I know of women who got the shot and still got cervical cancer.

edit: forgot to add that I'm immunosuppressed atm and my insurance won't cover it anyway, *sigh*..."
3615,What if a male has sex with an unvaccinated girl?
3616,I got it for free in Ontario.
3617,Who implemented this policy?
3618,I was going to make a comment that it must be based on insurance since I think it's recommended by the CDC for both. Then I saw B.C. and realized it's Canada. 
3619,I thought HPV didn't effect men in any way 
3620,Well this sounds like a truckload of chicken shit bullshit
3621,I'm getting really tired of this two tiered healthcare bullshit. Please save us NDP!
3622,[removed]
3623,Males are the carriers though.
3624,I remember having to pay all that out of pocket for the shots. I was at the time with a girlfriend that had HPV and approaching the cutoff age for being able to get the immunizations. We broke up before I could finish the series. So now I'm 66% safe from HPV or something.
3625,I am a male in Ontario and my family paid more for my HPV vaccine than this guy
3626,Men's lives aren't as important to the Canadian government.
3627,Just make it $170 for the both of them.
3628,"wait, Canada pays for medicine, i've been living a lie!"
3629,Sucks. Cause men don't know they have it and can pass it until they do.
3630,Is HPV contagious beyond sexual contact?
3631,As a kid I thought HPV stood for Hot pussy virus.  Either way I still didn't want it.  
3632,"As I understand it, the HPV viruses are pretty dangerous for individual MSM (men who have sex with men) - it's just that the impact (as measured) overall in *men* is low.

So we can't justify the cost effectiveness (and risk of a major reaction) of vaccinating all boys - but if we could identify all those boys who will become MSM, then it would be a no-brainer - and funded without anyone really arguing.

But we can't. For obvious reasons.

Ask a class of 12/13/14 year old boys if they're gay/bi or not and - in most schools - you can be pretty sure of a 100% *not gay* response.

While it might not be perfect, an approach whereby the HPV vaccine was free for boys, on demand, confidentially, with or without parental consent, would be best.  I don't think funding is really the problem for this - even if you covered every boy who thinks they may go onto have a same sex relationship it would still only be a fraction of what it costs to vaccine all the girls-the key is to make it ACCESSIBLE.  This is currently where the problem - identified in the article - lies.

There wouldn't be many who would take it up, but would give the option for those gay/bi boys with homophobic parents the option of protecting themselves - and if it was easily & freely available, word would spread pretty quickly amongst the (typically incredibly closeted) school/high school gay community.

The problem comes with the one-in-ten-million case where the child realises they're gay/bi, gets the vaccine, then has a catastrophic allergic reaction and is left severely injured/dead.

The parents would not be happy and donald trumps head would explode."
3633,"It's covered by insurance in the USA, but not in Canada."
3634,"Let's end sexism and include both men and women, boys and girls equally. Young boys need to be protected and informed of STIs/ STDs just as much as girls do."
3635,Remember guys if you're a young working make your taxes/insurance fees pays for everyone else's shit while you get fucked.
3636,"Australia introduced it to the vaccination schedule for girls in highschool some years ago and just recently has extended it to boys. A lot of that delay I think had to do with the fact there was a certain amount of organised opposition from conservatives and cervical cancer (because it is often so lethal) was an issue that it was just easier to convince the general populace to tell conservative agitators to go fuck themselves over. Introducing it to girls first let the general public get used to the idea without having to process and dismiss conspiracy theories about why do they have to vaccinate their sons.

Pretty much they did it because they were scared of MRAs getting tempted to get on the anti-vaccination bandwagon."
3637,I actually got it for free even though I'm a guy. 
3638,"A lot of the literature on HPV suggests that its way more cost effective to provide the vaccine to females instead of males. Yeah it would be better if everyone got the vaccine, but the money for that has to come from somewhere. And if you have a fixed budget, it's better to spend that money on stuff like prenatal care, where you end up saving many more lives."
3639,That simply won't do.  Autism is already running rampant
3640,There's no such thing as a free vaccine.
3641,From what I understand men who engage in man-on-man sex are more likely to suffer HPV-related diseases than straight guys. Although I supposed straight men can infect women.
3642,"So, where can I decent priced HPV vaccination in NYC?"
3643,So basically canada wants to spread sex germs?
3644,"It makes sense. If it's a disease that affects both genders, why is it free for one and not the other?"
3645,"HPV is also thought to be associated with head and neck cancer, specifically squamous cell carinoma, in men as well as women. Oral sex and multiple sex partners have been associated with increased risk of oral squamous cell carinoma.

How ignorant. B.C. is not an isolated territory on an alien planet."
3647,All vaccines should be free for everyone in the world. It benefits us all that pathogens do not circle in impoverished populations only to get stronger before they get to the 1st world. All nations should form a body that collects money that will be paid out in bounties to manufactures that develop these vaccines based on the damage those have on society. 
3648,"In Aus everyone gets thier hpv for free in highschool
"
3649,I heard there were negative style effects
3650,So make girls pay $340 per vaccine. That should make it fair.

3652,"At what point to you so far remove yourself from responsibility as a parent that you simply say ""you know what?  I am not capable of stopping my 6th grader from fucking randoms?"""
3653,"So.. if men can get hpv, and only women get the shot, the men are to assume she's had the shot?  That sounds like the same logic as a guy not using a rubber because he is to believe she's on birth control."
3654,Its free for everybody here in Australia. My sons class have all had the vaccination. But they got confused and started telling us they were immune to HIV.
3655,"Is the cancer that can affect women a lot more severe and harder to detect?  For guys, isn't it quite obvious and you just get the warts burned off your wooohooooo?  

I am not saying that this is correct, men deserve to be vaccinated for free, as well.  I am just conjecturing what the reasoning behind this might be.

Edit:  Appreciate all the answers to my inquiries, keep them coming!"
3656,"Look at this goddamn male privilege in action, how dare you want to have the same free vaccination that women get."

3662,Dispensability of men.
3663,"The HPV vaccine only vaccinates against a few high risk viruses that cause cervical cancer. There are 170 know HPV types. It's not to prevent all HPV, just the ones that cause cancer in women."
3664,"Lol @ everyone tripping over themselves to justify not vaccinating males for something that can, and has, given them cancer. Gotta love that male privilege. 

This society is hilarious, keep pulling out those statistics about how less men are affected ""bla bla bla bla"" and conveniently ignore the fact that more males are killed by CANCER IN GENERAL but it didn't stop the government and society in general from pouring the vast majority of its social awareness and funds into breast cancer, a cancer than almost exclusively affects women. 

Yep don't address your conative dissonance, its easier to just follow the herd.  "
3665,"Even if we accept the misanthropic attitude of ""nobody cares about boys"" the idea that we'd vaccinate girls, but not boys still misses the fundamental point of how HPV is spread.  Girls don't catch it from toilet seats, or touching frogs...they catch it from boys.

3669,ITT some really good debate points on both sides to go along with the common Reddit circlejerks
3670,"No charge for me.  Thanks, ACA."
3671,"I think the argument for not covering boys is that over 99% of males who contract it are successfully able to fight it off on their own within a years time, and if all the girls have the vaccine then they can't be infected during the year. It's obviously a cost saving move on the part of insurer's. "

3677,"I just found out last week I have HPV, I had a small wart frozen off, apparently that means I don't have the cancer kind, still I this shit was more publicised, I didn't even know there was a vaccine, or what HPV even was until a few weeks ago.

Does this mean I can just tell girls to get the vaccine and they can't catch it from me?"

If you have the money and manpower to give the vaccine to everyone at risk since day 0, then fantastic! Do it. But this rarely happens. 

You **have** to test a drug for each specific tissue-pathogen interaction. You cannot just say that since this works with HPV in the uterus, it will works in the throat. It probably will, but you cannot be sure.

This vaccine was created to avoid cervical cancer, and was tested and approved for that. It was created for cervical cancer because it is by far the most common complication of HPV infection among the serious stuff. 

Women are the group more at risk, a private company decided to develop a drug for that market, which is the biggest.

3758,"A lot of idiots here are making this out to be an issue about feminism and some sort of bullshit gender war, but it's not. The problem is funding. It's been hard enough to get the money for girls to get this vaccination, especially in Republican states (cuz Jesus don't want no one having sex for fun), getting it subsidized for everyone? I think most lefties (myself included) would be all for it, but good luck getting that passed."

That is how anti vaccine children get viruses that they arent immune to. There are vaccinated ones who are immune to it but they are also carriers.

 This is why a partner should only get the vaccine if they know they want to be with someone who has the virus.

Perhaps if/when these measures show a significant reduction in certain cancers it will be more widely covered. 

But it's not a mandatory vaccine. It's not required to attend schools. It's highly stigmatized. If offering it free to girls provides some good and helps it to be more widely accepted, then fantastic. I would equally support it just being offered to boys, just to get it out there. "

My country for example does not provide a vaccine for varicella or Hepatitis A, the state does provide application recommendations and you can go to a private clinic and get it but it's gonna cost you, the public system is not going to provide it for you. The same for the HPV, right now the health system provides only vaccines for girls because right now it's the most cost effective thing to do and a priority given the incidence of HPV-related cancer in women. The fact that people are making a ""damn feminists"" and ""men's rights!"" thing out of this is ridiculous. "
3872,I'd love a better understanding of why people above the age of 26 are legally barred from being vaccinated against HPV.  There are a variety of pretty obvious reasons people can make it to 26 without HPV and still be at risk to catch it.
3873,"since you studied the effect in males, perhaps you can help add some additional information to the below:

> The age limits are set by analyzing the vaccine's diminishing efficacy in the body, especially as males begin to engage in sexual activity (thus raising their chances of being exposed to HPV).

OK, let's remove from this the part about as age increases the chance they're exposed to HPV also increases.

Are you saying there are reasons the vaccine is less effective in males as they age, otherwise? What are the other mechanisms that would reduce the efficacy to a male who is never *actually* exposed to HPV as he ages? Or is this ""reduced efficacy"" point entirely or almost entirely relying on the fact the older someone gets the higher the chances they would have been exposed? If you take a 13 year old boy and a 35 year old man who have both never need exposed to HPV before, and then keep them both in sterile environments while undergoing the vaccination regimen, are you saying the vaccine will be less effective for the 35 year old man just because he is older? What are the mechanisms behind that reduced efficacy? Does this hold true for vaccines in general, or is this something specific to this vaccine / virus?

> In 2013, about 34.6% of boys between 13 and 17 years of age had at least one dose of Gardasil. However, 52% of those boys did not complete the full three dose series.

can you comment on a piece I read that postulated that those who received the first two doses observed the same, or almost the same, protection as those who took the full three dose regimen? I don't remember how rigorously researched the article was, but has a two-dose regimen been looked at from both an efficacy standpoint (how effective is the protection) as well as a longevity of protection standpoint (how long does the protection last)?"
3874,"> The age limits are set by analyzing the vaccine's diminishing efficacy in the body, especially as males begin to engage in sexual activity (thus raising their chances of being exposed to HPV).

I don't quite understand this. If the vaccine doesn't protect people that have sex, then whats the purpose? 

> Many argue that herd immunity can be achieved without vaccinating the majority of males, because over time HPV will simply become less and less prevalent.

Thats not herd immunity though. Thats like saying that the US has herd immunity to ebola.

Its pretty common for guys to sleep with more women, and a lot of families don't want their daughters to be vaccinated because they just think she won't have sex as opposed to just about every parent that thinks their son is going to try to get laid.

It's not fair to protect just girls while leaving boys at risk. My son is 6 months old, I have no idea what his sexual orientation is going to be. I am going to be supportive of him no matter what it is. I've seen what forcing a loved one to closet themselves can do and I won't make him feel that way. That being said, I'll be old and uncool and no kid wants to discuss that with their parents. At least I remember being terribly embarrassed about it when I was younger. I don't want to wait until he tells me to protect him if he's gay or bisexual. If I protect him the same way I would a girl, I'll be protecting not only my son, but any partners he has. "
3892,"Head and neck cancers have classically been linked to cigarette smoking. With smoking rates declining, a new population of head and neck cancer patients are emerging: young men/women non-smokers.

It's not that complex.  I'm not saying it's *right*, but it's not complicated.

> Why not open it to both parties?

...Because they don't have enough money?  As they said?"
3903,"You do realize that HPV poses a FAR greater risk for females than males, correct? A vast majority of HPV doesn't even affect males while greatly increasing the chance for cancer in females. It makes sense to provide a free vaccine for females. I'm not saying it's right that males aren't vaccinated, but it makes sense to focus on vaccinating the highest risk first. 

Edit: I'd just like to add I don't understand why there is even an argument here. Being a dude. it blows my mind that some dudes on Reddit can get this upset over something with rather simple reasoning. Take off your tinfoil hats and realize this has nothing to do with Women vs Men or whatever you want to call it. HPV sucks, I can almost guarantee in the future everyone will be vaccinated but as of now you should be happy we're able to protect half of the human population from a disease that was basically untreatable until around 15 years ago.

If they make it free for boys and girls, then the homosexual boys would be protected, and we can't have that.

Remember, when this vaccine first came out, it was a HUGE fight to get even girls immunized, and we're the ones at huge risk to get cervical cancer because of this virus, because everyone was so sure it would encourage girls to have sex if we were protected from this one particular thing. This is just further ""moral"" grandstanding along those lines. ""Boys don't have to worry as long as they are only having sex with girls who have already got the shot."""

You do realize that HPV poses a FAR greater risk for females than males, correct? A vast majority of HPV doesn't even affect males while greatly increasing the chance for cancer in females.

"
3928,HPV is more serious in women you fuckwits.
3929,"there actually is a medical reason behind it.  HPV usually doesn't do anything to men.  What I mean by usually is that some strains of HPV cause genital warts, most don't.  Genital warts are definitely gross, but they're not dangerous to men nor is HPV generally speaking.  HPV is however, dangerous to women.  HPV causes cervical cancer.  The problem with vaccinating everybody is the fact that strains mutate and vaccinating people against it makes it more likely for the strains that they can protect against to mutate and then the vaccine doesn't work anymore.  So they basically want to give the vaccine to women as HPV can be directly harmful in terms of cervical/vaginal cancer whereas for guys, HPV is gross in terms of genital warts, but not usually life threatening."
3930,"because the financial damage from not vaccinating women is higher. that is (likely) not the case for men.

it's not a cheap vaccine. cost effectiveness has to come into play. I assure you people actually run calculations to try and figure these things out.

it is often not subsidized for older women because of the reduced efficacy - they are assumed to be infected already."
3931,Because boys are only going to have sex with the females in that province.  Idiots.
3932,"It cuts the cost in half. In general cervical cancer caused by hpv is causing much more of a problem than other types of cancer caused by the virus that effects men. If you are limited in resources then this is the obvious decision to make. Obviously it should be free to everyone however it's underfunded, simply put we need to fund it more. "
3933,"Boys and girls are different at a biological level. Boys don't have cervices, so HPV doesn't drastically increase their chance of cervical cancer. It's much more important to ensure that women are vaccinated against HPV, and I don't think it's discriminatory to acknowledge that.

I guess it would be like handing out free sunscreen only to light-skinned people in a world where sunscreen is very expensive. White people are 30 times more likely to develop skin cancer, so it would probably be the most pragmatic solution."
3934,"> You have money for girls to get vaccinated, but not guys? How in the fuck does that make sense?

It would cost twice as much to vaccinate both genders as opposed to one.

It's kind of fucked up they're literally targeting homosexual boys by charging them hundreds of dollars to get vaccinated."
3935,"It's primarily because HPV can cause cancer in women. 

So the risk of HPV is double for women. HPV can most often clear up over time even though there is no cure, most fatal cases are in women.

Simply put, it's not a cheap vaccine and almost everyone is willing to  have such a vaccine covered (remember someone has to pay that) so others can pay higher insurance and/or taxes (I'm not sure who pays). Honestly, it's worth it, from an insurance point of view, Cancer is crazy expensive, a vaccine is far less expensive. 

So currently it's a simple numbers game: http://www.kegel.com/hpv/deaths/

And in the USA, you're free to take as many risks as you want, but if you take more risks, you should bear more of the costs. Everyone shouldn't have to pay for people to do stuff that's high risk."
3936,"As I understand it, HPV is more dangerous for girls, as it can sometimes induce cervical cancer. When there are cancerous effects for men, it is as a result of gay sex. It only shows up in the throat and tonsils.

Men definitely need to be vaccinated so HPV doesn't spread, but they don't carry much risk when they do get infected."
3937,"> Why not open it to both parties?

Because the health risks are more severe for females. Therefore, the benefit of vaccination is higher for females.

> You have money for girls to get vaccinated, but not guys?

That's the way money works. If you have a set budget, you can't magically buy twice the amount of vaccines unless the price drops by half. 

> How in the fuck does that make sense? 

Health impact, budgets...
"
3938,"GENDER BIAS? Brb, it's time to tumblr activate! "
3939,"I was actually trying to think of why it might cost more for boys than girls and I actually thought of a reason. 

While HPV does cause various types of cancer, I think by far the most common one is cervical cancer, which only affects females, obviously. I'm basing that off the fact that I have never heard of any man getting regularly screened for a kind of cancer that HPV causes, where such cervical cancer screenings are routine for women - that's what a pap smear is. So it's possible that the risk of cancer for women/girls is so much higher that it justifies having disparate resources be devoted to protecting them. It's a choice between giving the vaccine to girls for free because they need it more and having the boys who don't need it as much pay if they want it vs. having everyone pay equally, but the higher risk for girls is not as reduced because fewer girls will get the vaccine then. 

It's a question of how do you deploy limited resources to do the most good. If the risk is highest for a particular population, it might make sense to target that population with what you have, even if it is not fair to other populations (whose risk is lesser).

I have no numbers to back this up, but I can imagine that the numbers play out in such a way that makes this a rational decision. I also do not know if they considered making the vaccine cost the same for everyone, if that reduced the prevalence of the disease enough to outweigh the fact that fewer people (presumably) would get it.
"
3940,"Free vaccines for girls but not boys is a result of the patriarchy, men feel like they have to take care of women so they can use them for breeding purposes. We need feminism to fight for equality so that boys can get vaccines."
3941,"My question is then, that if the argument for (heterosexual) boys not getting this for free, is that they are protected by the vaccination of women, does that then mean that future (heterosexual) men, who sleep with women, who elected as girls not to be vaccinated (or had their parents elect, rather), would they then be able to hold those women liable for health expenses and emotional damages?

If the reason men don't get this for free, is that they are protected by the women getting vaccinated, then that should put responsibility on the women; I somehow doubt that would be the case.

(And I don't think that would be a fair system either, before anyone goes mental, just saying thats where the line of (flawed) reasoning would lead)

"
3942,"Welcome to ""equality"". "
3943,"I have many problems with this statement, but one of my biggest issues is that they thing only homosexual men do not deserve to be protected. "
3944,"Possibly because the biggest fear with HPV is the small collection of cancers associated with it, and women have --by far-- the highest risk of being effected.

Sure, ideally you'd protect everyone. But the harsh truth is that many places simply don't have the cash for comprehensive free vaccines. By vaccinating all teenage girls you eliminate (wild guessing) 90% of the risk. Paying twice as much to vaccinate all teenage boys and girls, you eliminate... maybe 92% of the risk. By paying four times as much and vaccinating not just teens, but everyone up to the age of 35 you eliminate... maybe 95% of the risk.

The term we're looking for here is 'Diminishing Returns'.

As this gets phased in and we have further improvements to the vaccine, it will expand to wider and wider audiences. For now, there is a cost-benefit balance, and the benefit for focusing on teenage girls is a pretty good place to be right now."
3945,"It does make sense. What is the best outcome for investment?

Vaccinating 50% of the population (all men or all women) would have roughly the safe effect. In most people the disease would be gone.

Now which do you chose, women or men? Well, men do not develop cancer at the same rate as women do from HPV. "
3946,"I'm guessing because cervical cancer is the most prevalent cancer caused by HPV, followed by oral cancer. But vaccinating both genders is really the only way to get it under control. I had to pay out of pocket. It should be free for *everyone*, regardless of age and gender. It's a vaccine against an STD that causes *cancer* for fuck's sake. "

3954,Because girls get cancer from HPV and guys get warts. So if the government is able to pay 50% of the cost and still prevent the vast majority of the bad effects of HPV then thats pretty good and is a lot eaasier to legitamize.

Women are viewed as a resource in the eyes of evolution. It takes just one male to repopulate the species, while it takes several women.

Due to this there's an instinct within us that wishes to preserve women. It is via this instinct that allows for women to get away with as much as they are able based solely on their gender. 

It is also due to this instinct that people can't see past their prejudices when it comes to issues like this. If you're male I guarantee you want to protect women much more readily than you do men. 

Just take one look at those domestic violence social experiments where the chick starts hitting her ""boyfriend"" and bystanders laugh/do nothing.

4038,You are American though. This is Canada.
4039,Please educate how to do so... Pm sent
4040,"Yes, that's why they say it. FYI Even with the vaccine it's still possible to contract HPV. "
4041,Condoms arent all that effective at preventing hpv transmission
4042,I'm a female and because I'm over a certain age I also have to pay for it. My doctor charged me $300. It's not free for all women just girls under 12. 
4043,"Um, as a feminist who contracted HPV, I'm all for getting more people vaccinated. So....await no more. "
4044,Which would actually make sense because they would protect non-vaccinated women. 
4045,"How did feminists become the big boogieman?  The reason females are covered is because the pharmaceutical company (Merck) who makes the drug lobbied for it after it was licensed for the vaccination of females (9 to 26 years old).  If you are angry only women are covered take it up with them.

Edit: words"
4046,"That's only funny if feminists hadn't been promoting HPV vaccine for boys as well as girls all along. (They have been.)

Edit: Actually, this would be a good issue for the MRM to take up, especially if they ever want to shake off their mantle of misogny. 

I await all of the MRAs coming out in droves to get this corrected with great anticipation."
4047,"My entire facebook feed is feminists.  Yes, they strongly support publicly funded HPV vaccines for boys.

edit: [also it seems overwhelmingly likely that the woman in this story is herself a feminist](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3lahv8/hpv_vaccine_should_be_free_for_boys_says_mother/cv4raqh)"
4048,"Considering this disproportionately affects gay men, whom feminists have been historical allies of since Stonewall, I can't help but assume you are simply trying to rewrite the history of civil rights to specifically exclude feminists. "
4049,"Holy fuck, you people never miss an opportunity to cry about feminism do you?"
4050,"As a feminist, I support vaccinating men as well. Don't pigeonhole us.

*edit: clarity"
4051,"My last year of college I took a class called ""Gender, Power, and Health"" and we talked about how boys weren't really encouraged  to get the HPV vaccine and how it was outrageous that there was no HPV test for men. There were like 50 people in the class and I bet all of them considered themselves feminists. 

This was in 2011/2012 and I just looked and boys have almost the same vaccination rate as girls now (in the US). "
4052,"So, I read [this article](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/leaving-boys-out-of-hpv-vaccination-program-doesnt-make-sense-doctor/article26283436/), and there are, as I count it, there's 4 women (two mothers, an OBGYN, and a cancer researcher) interviewed on the subject who say that boys should be vaccinated for free as well, 1 man who is making excuses based on cost, and a spokeswoman for a man responding with ""we're reviewing it"". And the person reporting on the situation is a woman. 

I couldn't verify that they actually called themselves feminists, but in that particular story (which seems to be written from a neutral point of view) it's the women saying ""We should vaccinate the boys along with the girls"" and the men that are avoiding the question or making excuses based on money.

Also, the private feminist facebook group I'm in has a bunch of women (and a few men), and everyone there seems to be very insistent that we should go ahead and vaccinate the boys too.

So your waiting is over! Congratulations!"
4053,"Yeah and I await all the men pounding down the doors DEMANDING the HPV vaccine in order to take responsibility for their reproductive health. 

So so so sick of this completely made up BULLSHIT on reddit. Feminists are at the forefront of the mens vaccine debate. And by debate, I don't mean making uneducated comments on reddit, but actually going out, doing the clinical research, writing academic papers to support the vaccination of boys and lobbying at the provincial and federal levels. Seriously FUCK this circle jerk. A very very large majority of feminists advocate men being vaccinated. It's not men's fault for not DEMANDING equal health care, no no no, It's FEMINISTS fault for not demanding it for them. ok then.

4054,Every feminist I know is in support of vaccinating boys as well.
4055,"What the fuck dude? As a straight woman, the way I GET hpv is THROUGH MEN. Why the fuck wouldn't I want them vaccinated as well? Besides the fact that I give a shit about men's health and am very passionate about public health and sex education in general, a common theme in feminists. I'm going to college to study community health to encourage better sex/health education in communities, and hopefully reduce the spread of viruses like HPV.

What are YOU doing to get it corrected?"
4056,"did you know that when the recession hit, male-dominated fields like construction lost millions of jobs, while female-fields like education and healthcare gained jobs. So the government proposed an economic stimulus for those fields. Feminists successfully fought against this, arguing that it was discrimination to support men, and caused the government to give money to women who didn’t deserve it. Hundreds of professional feminists complained against the “sexism” of helping men (who had lost jobs) and not women (who had gained jobs). 

http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/016/659dkrod.asp

or how about the fact that men are way more likely to kill themselves or in generall die earlier then women? When ever somebody tries to adress this injustice feminimst scream sexism and try to ruin it. That´s right. Trying to help men so that they life longer and don´t kill themselves is considered sexist by feminist

they

4057,"I'm a feminist. I'm a feminist who regularly posts to SRS.  You would probably label me an ""SJW"".  And I'm here to tell you that I not only support making the vaccine free for boys, but that feminists have been calling for the same thing for years (and, in fact, have been the primary voices calling for this).

Go burn your straw man on someone else's lawn, eh?"

4059,"[They have been.](http://www.msmagazine.com/winter2010/menshealth.asp)

That article is from 2010, by the way. "
4060,"Well, feminists actually do shit unlike ^^^le reddit MRAs. So yeah, if this goes viral, expect to see some outrage! "
4061,"Actually, feminists have been pushing for this to be free for boys and girls since the beginning. Just no one listened to them because you know, they're women."
4062,"LOL at all the feminists here shutting down your accusations because they believe in equal access to the vaccine and providing proof that feminists are lobbying for it, only to get drowned out by the circlejerk because bigotry and pitchforks are more fun than reality."
4063,The fuck does this have to do with feminism? This is an economic issue 
4064,"Another feminist here, yeah, it should be free for guys under 12 too. But here's the thing; most of us don't have cervixes. So the whole cervical cancer thing, which is *why* the HPV vaccine is free in the first place, isn't really an issue. As a man, I believe that the resources required to offer the HPV vaccine for free to boys would be better used to combat diseases and medical conditions that disproportionately affect men to the same extent as HPV does women. "
4065,"Viruses don't harm men to the same degree as women because we live in a patriarchal society.


Infection is having an infectious agent while lacking in societal power shitlord."
4066,Why are you coddling men? They can solve their own problems. Comments like yours are the real misandry. 
4067,"free for men and women in my country and given in schools as part of the normal vaccination schedule. 

I'm a feminist too. So do I now need to get that policy in place in America?"
4068,"Wait, wait, wait. How did a woman advocating for her son to get free HPV vaccine turn into a way to hate on feminists? Jesus, reddit."
4069,"Don't hold your breath, bro."
4070,">It's shocking how dated so many medical standards are. Vaccines should be for everyone at a low cost for everyone, disease doesn't give a damn either way.

So what's the solution? Force the drug companies to charge a lower price at gunpoint? If Gardasil were cheap, they'd have the resources to vaccinate everyone, but that isn't the case. "
4071,Who says its a medical standard? It's some bureaucrat's cost cutting measure in a country where the government pays for healthcare so you have to listen to them.
4072,"> We have to realize that women have disadvantages that need to be addressed in society. Sexism does exist.

> Equality for all is the goal for every rational person.

IMO this idea of clearly unequal biological differences being reshaped by government action is not the ""rational"" position. It's ignoring functional differences between the sexes. For example, men have measurable differences than woman when it comes to strength. So the rational position is that sometimes one sex is better than the opposite sex for certain jobs."
4073,Because it only recently became a thing boys need to / should / can do. It's probably a policy lag more than anything else.
4074,"It IS gender discrimination, and hopefully this draws attention to a major issue and it gets solved."
4075,"Cuz its men on the receiving end, duh!"
4076,"Because women are far, far more likely to have health issues related to HPV than men are, so much so that the HPV vaccine was marketed as a ""women's issue"" until very recently. It would be like if a new HIV vaccine became commercially available, it might be branded as a ""gay issue"" until more information and research came out. "
4077,"It is 100% percent gender discrimination.  The justification is that women are more likely to get cancer from HPV than men, by about a factor of 2.  

I don't agree with that justification, but there it is."
4078,"Because it benefits women.


"
4079,"Because straight boys are theoretically protected by girls being vaccinated. It's only those super icky ""men who have sex with men"" who are unprotected, and it's OK for them to get ~~cooties~~ HPV because they are icky. 

At least that seems to be the gist of it. Definitely not right, either way. Just freaking vaccinate everyone. "
4080,"Drugs are not free. Some vaccines are free through school programs, but in general, drugs are not free. Seeing a doctor, going to the ER, a hospital stay, a surgery, chemotherapy, etc.. FREE!"
4081,Nothing is free.  Someone else getting stuck with the bill for something doesn't mean that something was free.

4084,"I think that ethylmercury and aluminum adjuvants are contributing to increased Autism and Alzheimer's Disease rates, and that the artificially provoked responses are contributing to rises in autoimmune conditions."

4105,"I believe HPV significantly increases the risk of cervical cancer too. I remember reading something about it being relatively harmless for men and totally possible to have HPV and never know it. I'm afraid I don't have the article anymore.

It still seems like it would be in society's best interest to provide this vaccine free to everyone, but then it would probably be in society's best interest to provide free emergency medical services and post-secondary education and that seems pretty unlikely."
4106,It doesn't protect against every type of HPV therefore you could still get cervical cancer if you had the strain of HPV that it does not vaccinate for. 
4107,"I was told by my Dr. men RARELY have any knowledge they even have HPV and go on about their ""business"" and usually without out repeated exposure their immune systems can fight it off and then its gone, until somebody with it has sex with them and they get it again. Still, they usually have no clue, unless they happen to get the strain the causes genital warts, then they usually know...

Women usually are affected by it without knowing it and in lots of cases can fight it off on their own too, but sometimes the immune system can't and when that is when you progress to pre-cancer and cervical cancer, while still symptomless mind you. 

Also, something like 89% of the population(as in men and women) has it. Ew.

source: I am a woman who's immune system apparently wasn't up to the challenge."
4108,"idk if thats the case, but i know they can transmit it. and thats a good enough reason to get the vaccine. "
4109,"HPV accounts for ~12,000 cases of varius types of cancer in men every year."
4110,I already knew this and I'm glad I can help. 
4111,natural selection is a thing though.
4112,6th grader? Probably can control it. Once high school hits? Good luck.
4113,A lot of the things we do for our sixth graders are more about them becoming healthy effective adults than about them being sixth graders.
4114,"No, it isn't a minor thing for men either. [According to the CDC HPV can cause not only genital warts, but also throat cancer, anal cancer, and cancer of the oropharynx (the back of the throat, including the tonsils and back of the tongue) in men](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/hpvandmen-fact-sheet-february-2012.pdf)."
4115,Hpv is one of the leading causes of head and neck cancers in males. 
4116,"Yes.  HPV is a leading cause for cervical and Uterine cancer.  Its effect on men is far less severe.  This does not, however, excuse institutional sexism.  We ladies will complain until the cows come home about how unfair it is that our birth control and other meds aren't covered by insurance but viagra is.  Can't have it both ways - either costs are the same regardless of gender or they are not.  Pick one. "
4117,"Its more closely linked to cervical cancer and has been studied much more significantly there. It is believed to contribute to a significant number of throat cancers but these are also usually in conjunction with other factors.

While men are less likely to suffer from the [HPV linked cancers](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm) its not that much of a disparity as to consider it rare (1/3 of cancer cases identified). From what [I can see oral cavity and pharynx cancers generally have lower survival rates.](https://nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/Survival/Relative_Survival_Tables.pdf) Further they [are reportedly expensive to treat](http://www.cancer8.com/throat-cancer/statistics.html)"
4118,Ever heard of herd immunity?  A guy who's not vaccinated can spread it to a bunch of gals.
4119,"Not all strains of HPV are equally likely to lead to visible warts.  And, in fact, the strains that the vaccine targets, these strains that lead to cancer most frequently, are the ones that *do not* tend to cause visible warts."
4120,"Cervical cancer and cryosurgery affect millions of women. Yes, it should be free for everyone but the risk to women is much, much greater."
4121,"Like what else?

Edit: I'm genuinely curious..."
4122,"You actually think feminists are the ones responsible? How about you call out the MRAs, where are they?"
4123," > Does this mean I can just tell girls to get the vaccine and they can't catch it from me?

Logic would dictate that you would ask your doctor while they were freezing off the wart."
4124,"Same here. I wish I would have been given more information about HPV in sex ed. I didn't learn that going down on people leaves you at risk for neck and throat cancers until after I found out I had genital warts. No, the vaccine doesn't offer 100 protection. If you've been wart free for 6 months most doctors will tell you you're no infectious. If you have any questions PM me."
4125,"Yeah, I'm not either and I've never heard of a place where you have to pay for vaccines but then again, if you break a leg in America, you'll be paying that off for life."
4126,I can't believe it took me this long to find a voice of reason.
4127,"Here! I've been arguing in favor of everyone receiving the vaccine since it was introduced in the US. I'm a woman and a feminist and I used to be very active in ""Internet Feminism."" Regardless of any political stance, it makes sense to vaccinate everyone since HPV poses a threat to everyone. I agree that it's bullshit to charge for boys' vaccines."

4142,HPV is a very expensive vaccine - most small practices don't carry it simply because it's not worth the investment to them.
4143,The hypocritical feminists aren't going to respond.  But the non-hypocritical ones think this is ridiculous and that it should be free for both boys and girls in grade 6.  
4144,What does this have to do with feminism? Did I miss something?
4145,"I actually understand the logic. If all the girls are vaccinated, and heterosexual boys are only having sex with those vaccinated girls, the boys are protected as well as the girls without wasting money on redundantly vaccinating the boys. "
4146,You realize the vaccine is for protection for the rest of their lives? It doesn't mean they are going to go out and have sex 
4147,"While they're carrying it, it can cause throat, penile and anal cancers, it's just more likely to cause cancer in women. There is going to be an explosion of people with throat cancers. Hopefully with the vaccine, it will die down after the people who didn't get the vaccine die out."
4148,This is in Canada.
4149,You should be. You can still carry it and spread it. 
4150,"All HPV types affect men and women in the same way, insofar as the types that produce warts put both genders at risk for warts, and the types the are high-risk cancer types put both genders at a higher risk of cancer.  Women get cancer more frequently, but you are very naive to not be concerned with viruses such as HPV."

There's also no recommended HPV test for Men, so unless they show symptoms, i.e. warts, they have no way of knowing they're contagious and infected.

Uh, what? My BC is only covered because I told them that I was sexually active. At the time, I wasn't, but it was the only solution to the debilitating, bring-you-to-your-knees kind of cramps that kept me from going to school/work. They told me I would get it for free if I was sexually active, but I would be required to pay for the prescription if it was for the cramps. 

Not all contraception is covered 100%. For women, it's contingent on the reason you tell your doctor (at least, such is the case for my insurance). "

We have 2-3hr wait times for our family doctors because they overbook intentionally to make more money from the government, or at least so I'm told.  We have dangerously insane wait times in ER rooms.  We have homeless people and natives and people of colour going ignored and dying in waiting rooms, being assumed they're on drugs or drunk.  We have to pay for our own prescription medicine out of pocket.  

And I have family in England who tell me it's quite different over there.

4224,"So true. I got the vaccines when I was younger. Got HPV from my fiance, he didn't even know he had it. After the pap smear I had to get a small biopsy to diagnose, a cone biopsy to get rid of it, and then a LEEP when the cone biopsy was not enough. The LEEP involves an electrified loop that cuts through the tissue by frying it; it was a very unpleasant experience. And four years later when I got pregnant I found out I might not be able to have a vaginal birth due to scarring and an insufficient cervix. Luckily all worked out, had a baby vaginally, and now I have a beautiful 4 month old girl! But for some, the effects of HPV & it's treatment extend far into their life through cancer, infections, infertility, pregnancy problems, and more."
4225,"You could think of herd immunity in this case being x% of sexual partners as it takes two to tango. (In which most case is either F-m(High probability of one being immune/low risk for the other).. M-M(Not much risk) F-F(high probability of both being immune) and even probably less large scale M-M-^N -F(Low probability of any one partner being immune, although not much risk for most participants)

This kind of thinking obviously works less the more BI/more sexual partners you engage in. Statistically though I think it works out that there aren't enough of those type to break achieving a statistically good number. The CDC obviously thought about this though, which is why they recommend homosexual/bi guys should get vaccinated up to 29.

Sexually transmitted diseases are just a lot easier to control than airborne/basic contact diseases.

Regardless...if a guy wants a vaccine I don't see why it should be a problem on a voluntary basis, to give them for free like females(especially if you identify as bi or homosexual.

Less go with 5% vaccine failure rate/missed shots, and just magically they all have HPV because magic. He'd have a chance to get infected 1/20 different sexual partners. Then after that he'd only have a 1/20 chance to infect any one particular person(although in this case we already assumed everyone vulnerable was infected.

Catching it early is good because it makes it easier to treat, but it doesn't inflate the overall rate - there aren't a bunch of ""minor"" cases of cervical cancer that would resolve on their own if we didn't catch them.

(Cervical dysplasia, or abnormal/precancerous cells on the cervic, *does* often resolve on its own. But it's not cancer and isn't factored into the cancer rates.)"

4254,"I wouldn't call it 'legally barred', considering the CDC phrases it as a 'recommendation'. However, I believe the limit has something to do with the aforementioned formulas of cost-effectiveness. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. I would recommend checking out the CDC's website."
4255,">OK, let's remove from this the part about as age increases the chance they're exposed to HPV also increases.
Are you saying there are reasons the vaccine is less effective in males as they age, otherwise? What are the other mechanisms that would reduce the efficacy to a male who is never actually exposed to HPV as he ages? Or is this ""reduced efficacy"" point entirely or almost entirely relying on the fact the older someone gets the higher the chances they would have been exposed? If you take a 13 year old boy and a 35 year old man who have both never need exposed to HPV before, and then keep them both in sterile environments while undergoing the vaccination regimen, are you saying the vaccine will be less effective for the 35 year old man just because he is older? What are the mechanisms behind that reduced efficacy? Does this hold true for vaccines in general, or is this something specific to this vaccine / virus?

As far as I know, likelihood of exposure is the primary reasoning. Perhaps I should rephrase the sentence, because I see how it implies there could be other reasons. The truth is that - on the science end of the research - I'm not an expert. I studied the public health side of the problem; in other words, the factors that could contribute to increased vaccine uptake in male populations.

>can you comment on a piece I read that postulated that those who received the first two doses observed the same, or almost the same, protection as those who took the full three dose regimen? I don't remember how rigorously researched the article was, but has a two-dose regimen been looked at from both an efficacy standpoint (how effective is the protection) as well as a longevity of protection standpoint (how long does the protection last)?

like I mentioned, I'm not well-versed in the harder science behind the vaccine's efficacy. However, I do believe in the idea of a 'minimum effective dose' for any medication... so it's probably possible that 2 doses can be effective relative to none at all. Sorry I can't provide better answers, but I appreciate the fact that you are curious.
"
4256,It doesn't protect people who have already gotten HPV before they were given a vaccine. 
4257,"It does protect people that have sex, but it's more effective as a preventative strategy than it is as a treatment - if that makes sense.

4274,Penile cancer nonetheless
4275,It's giving oral sex to men leading to (fairly rare) throat cancers that is the worst risk for men.
4276,It's not really about promiscuity. Diseases propagate through smaller communities faster than larger ones since every infected individual comprises a larger percentage of the total population.  So for STDs groups of people who have smaller pools of sexual partners (for example MSM) have higher transmission rates.  
4277,"Vaginal intercourse has a lot lower rate of hiv transmission compared to anal sex though, so heterosexual couples are a lot less likely to transmit the disease. "
4278,Just want to clarify something.  It's because homosexual males which make up a very small percentage of the population account for something like 50 to 60% of all new cases of HIV.  It's a perfectly rational thing to do from a medical standpoint.
4279,I thought it had to do with the fact that the AIDs epidemic started and is still much more predominant in the gay community.

I think it's the other way around. It's not that straight people are sleeping around as much as gays were once assumed to, it's that neither gay nor straight people sleep around as much as gays were once assumed to.

*There is only a one percentage point difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals in their promiscuity: 98% of gay people have had 20 or fewer sexual partners; 99% of straight people have had the same number. Tellingly, OkCupid found that it is just 2% of gay people that are having 23% of the total reported gay sex.*

4286,Haha as if people have more sex now than before- somehow I don't think human monkeys are suddenly more promiscuous.  It is probably just that people who do it don't lie about it as much-
4287,"Well that and the 1 in 5 HIV rate in gay men in the United States. With 55% of the new infections being homosexual men.  Think about that 1% of the population makes up 55% of the total HIV infection rate.

Now that's a problem because the test doesn't test for the virus it tests for the anti bodies. Which after 2 weeks you have a 95% chance of catching.  But it doesn't become 100% until 3 to 6 months after. 

Point being to all this rambling is though the risk is small, its still a risk. Elevating someone's risk for a lifetime infection that requires expensive drugs with horrible side effects, that you have to take more of as you grow older, just to make people feel better is dumb 

It's the same thought process on why you can't give blood for up to a year if you get a tattoo in certain states. Or you can't give blood for up to a year after a syphilis infection. "

4289,Well this policy is actively making the gay community riskier so I guess it's a self fulfilling prophecy. 
4290,"A lot of that has to do with how much easier it is to spread HIV through anal sex. The vast majority of guys who fuck guys have anal sex with their male partners. It kinda makes sense, but it sucks to have a lifelong ban on donating blood. This also leads to weird conversations when the girl you've been dating one week asks if you want to donate blood together, and you have to say you can't."
4291,Even vaccinating half of the heard (girls) would see infection rates plummet to nearly zero.
4292,"Except while the vaccine has a high effectiveness for targeted strains, there are many strains it has lower effectiveness for, which vaccinating everyone will continue providing increased protection for the whole group."
4293,That is only part of it.  Vaccinate all regardless of gender and stop charging exorbitant prices just because they are male.

4316,"The more people get vaccinated the better, though. Even if some people *don't* get the vaccination, their partners might be vaccinated."
4317,Also it's primarily to prevent cervical cancer. Gay guys don't have a cervix. 
4318,"So... Use the money you have, divided by the people who want the vaccine, and boom, there's the cost. Having this huge gender disparity is not justified. It's sexist, it's really unfair to gay men since they get no protection. If you really feel the need make a sliding discount for those at the most risk. That would give girls roughly half the cost of boys bases on cdc cancer stats posted above. "
4319,"Or they could do something fairly obvious, and offer it to everyone for 50% of the cost. "
4320,"The problem is that if it were flipped and boys/men were the ones getting the free vaccine while girls had to pay for it, so many people would flip their shit that suddenly enough money would be found to pay for everyone to get it. "

Edit: Downvoted for asking a question :/"
4322,"I remember the same thing with the Rubella vaccine in Canada in the 80s.

As it turned out, it wasn't very effective to have only half the population immunized, so now all kids receive it."
4323,"Wouldn't vaccinating males further protect women?  Currently it seems like some dumb-asses think getting this is somehow giving there daughter permission to start banging so they hold off.  

If it's just something everyone gets, it might lower the stigma plus a girl not vaccinated will having a lower risk if more males are."

High-risk HPVs also cause head and neck cancers, and the number of HPV-positive H&N cancers is increasing at a such a rate that they will outnumber cervical cancer by about 2020.  And men experience a disproportionately high percentage of that cancer burden."
4342,HPV causes oral and throat cancer. This affects men of all sexual orientations. This isn't simply about establishing herd immunity. 
4343,Of course most women get HPV from men.
4344,"You're right, it's more dangerous for females. So vaccinating makes prevents them being carriers, transferring the virus to those unable to be vaccinated. It should be free for everyone, or about 1/10th the price it is if we hope to establish herd immunity."

4347,"I'm a heterosexual female. If I were to get HPV, guess who would have given it to me? A **male** carrier.

4348,"But in nearly every other thread about vaccines on reddit, people point out that that's not how vaccines work. 

They point out that vaccines are more likely to work when everyone is vaccinated and there is herd immunity to viruses. 

So men being vaccinated will protect women who aren't or couldn't be vaccinated. It will help stop that virus from spreading altogether."
4349,"But technically, males tend to be the more sexually active of the two genders. By vaccinating males, we'd probably be doing more to prevent the spread of HPV. "

4382,"TIL genital warts in your throat is now ""sick for a few days."""
4383,"Actually it doesn't, and what you and others have said made logical sense a few years ago when HPV vaccine started up. It's pretty well known in public health (namely health behavior and health communication) at this point that we botched the HPV vaccine roll out, like there shouldn't be this much push back against HPV. One of the reasons is the over-focus on HPV being only suited for females as that reduces the importance of the vaccine (and the disease) in the eyes of the general public. That is the same general public that not only will be receiving the vaccine but also support directly or indirectly funding for providing the vaccine (tax payers and voters).

In essence, we botched the rollout to the point where public perception of HPV is severely warped as a women's only vaccine (it's not), HPV isn't a big deal for everyone (it's not), and this isn't a necessary vaccine. The fact that the vaccine was marketed and promoted towards almost entirely women caused a lot of issues downstream in getting people to actually support and get the vaccine.

So instead of paying the economic costs upfront, we created more economic costs downstream. Same for moral and public perception."

My immune system can't seem to keep it in check. Since I have one or both of the strains that cause warts, it's safe to assume that I also have high-risk HPV as well. I'm trying to quit smoking at the moment, it's going well, but I suspect the damage is done in terms of smoking, alcohol, and unprotected oral sex. It's only a matter of time in my mind. Growing up I heard about genital warts from my parents, and I knew they could last forever, but I didn't learn about high-risk HPV, throat cancer and oral sex until after I was told I had genital warts. The public's lack of knowledge when it comes to HPV is insane. This needs to be a major part of sex ed."

There are a good number of us there with head and neck cancer experience and besides getting support, it serves as kind of a repository of info for how to get through the treatment, what to expect, and different techniques some people use for helping with some of the side effects.

""The median time to clearance of any HPV infection was 5.9 months (95% confidence interval, 5.7-6.1 months)"" [ref](http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/198/6/827). 

There is a possibility for a post-clearance 'latency' in basal cells of warts cleared by immune activity alone (freezing, etc. will completely remove the basal cells), that can be reactivated by mechanical irritation (see [ref](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879625713000977) ) but that's certainly not the norm."

Those are still contributing to the burden of head and neck cancers now but have been diminishing over time as a result of healthier choices and better education about smoking.  Whereas these cancers typically affected older patients, HPV-positive head and neck cancer patients are typically younger by at least a decade.  It's thought that smoking and drinking are likely still confounding factors in some of these cancers along with the fact that more young men are diagnosed than young women because of the success of the vaccines available.  Beyond that it's not certain yet why HPV-positive head and neck cancers affect more men as they are (relatively speaking) new and this is a hot area of research (both clinical and basic)."

4417,"Except in that case neither would be protected.  It's about herd immunity, and generally transmission goes between the groups rather than within them.  If we can get 80% of women vaccinated, that will largely protect both men and women because the virus will be unable to reliably transmit between people and so will not spread very much.  If we get 40% of men and 40% of women, the virus will still easily be able to transmit between people and so nobody will be protected (not really even those who are vaccinated, because vaccines aren't 100%)."

Easy. Sexist attitudes and discrimination against women/girls has been considered the worst thing since before most of us were born. Sexist attitudes and discrimination against men/boys has been considered at best trivial and secondary, at worst actively justified. A huge amount of redditors (including myself) grew up seeing horrible attitudes about men/boys and sexist policies benefiting women/girls and victimising men/boys being promoted by the very same people who would throw a fit at the tiniest possible hint of the reverse. Grew up in a world where explicit male sexist entitlements had been done away with (and rightly so), but explicit female entitlements were still seen as valid.

This actually really does trace back to the *fem*inist view, where sexism is a unidirectional system of male privelege and female oppression, rather than something which was once neccesary for survival in a pre-modern age but is now no longer relevant, something which is much more of an issue of a conforming majority of both sexes victimising a less conforming minority of both sexes rather than a ""battle of the sexes"" issue of one sex unidirectionally victimising the other."

As implied by my original comment, this would not be an issue if feminists did not claim that there shouldn't be a men's rights movement because they care for men just as much as women. This is why MRAs are blanket regarded as misogynists, especially here on reddit.

4490,"there are a few underlying biological diffrences, however most of them have been accentuated by years of segragated society in a sense. There are biological reasons why in most societies men are the more athletic and it's not completely to do with hormone levels.

 I actually read a really interesting study that shows why societies like the Amazons didn't survive and its becuase that as women become more athletic thier menstrual cycles become farther apart. These societies didnt fail because women were weaker, but because they were less fertile. This meant that societies that had men doing manual labor simply outpopulated other social structures. 

The worlds strongest women will never be able to compete with the worlds strongest man (without jucing). However, the average strength for men and women will become closer to eachother over time. I know a plenty of women (carpenters) who could beat me in an arm wrestling contest with a handicap. Strength may eventually be a sign of profession rather than gender (with the obvious variation in the profession itself.)"

4504,"well, women have the (respective trade union of) American gynecologists lobbying for us. Unfortunately there's not really a medical specialty of ""men's general health"" the way there is for women; some people consider urology to be it, but nobody goes to a urologist unless they need to, and technically they serve women with incontinence and related issues as well.

So yeah you're probably right. Big pharma/healthcare is formidable opponent."
4505,"In terms of affording, as a man, it seems reasonable to vaccinate the at-risk people. The risk for men is low enough to not vaccinate.

If a woman is unable to get the vaccine due to allergies or something then she's basically screwed under the current system.  If men are vaccinated too then it greatly reduces that persons risk of contracting the virus."
4511,Women aren't trying to have it both ways. I want men to be vaccinated just as readily as women. Stop spreading false ideas and perpetuating the stereotype that women and feminists are reverse sexist man haters.
4512,"> HPV is a leading cause for cervical and Uterine cancer. Its effect on men is far less severe.

4513,">Can't have it both ways - either costs are the same regardless of gender or they are not. Pick one.

Why? 

This may be one case where costs to insurance consumers and providers far exceed the potential benefits. We're going to double the cost and coverage, and do what to the incidence of which diseases? For what end, exactly? (I'm not an epidemiologist, so I'll leave that answer to someone who's qualified.) Ignoring cost-benefit simply for the sake of maintaining the illusion of equality is blindness. "

4544,"Well, what I was getting at is that HPV is a sexually transmitted virus.  If we teach our young ones to ""wait until marriage"" they should not contract it.   This is sort of like marriage and HIV.  If two people are monogamous and loyal to each other without HIV, the chances of them getting HIV are very VERY slim."

4557,"But they can spread disease and contract diseases which can cost a significant amount to manage or cure. Sexual contraception shouldn't be a gender issue--at all. The fact that men have any litmus test for is as dumb as Hobby Lobby and their bullshit. 

Not going to after you, sorry if I sound combative; I get what you're saying. But in the end, even women will benefit from men having free access to contraception--because you are supplying both ends of the problem with the ability to solve it, rather than relying on one. Not to mention, the costs for a man with children is significant as well--the courts have become very strict with wage garnishment for child aid. Even statutory rape victims have had their wages garnished to help pay for natal care and child support (Not kidding)...And while I think THAT is extreme? I'm perfectly fine with forcing fathers to enjoin in the cost in a very strict manner (So no, this post is not bitching about the courts being over zealous with child support). I only mention it to show that the genders shouldn't be different in the preventive measures; from children to disease, the costs savings of safe sex for both genders is bonkers. 

(And I know there are some stupid things in the other direction too; like Viagra coverage in some plans, while the Pill had to be forced..None of it is right. Sex is a part of life, in fact you can make the case it is THE focus of life...Anything that reduces systemic cost, and aids in what is considered reasonable sexual function--should be automatic.)

4569,"uhh... I think they're essentially the same?  What I know, is they made a small incision below her belly button, went in and cut and cauterized her fallopian  tubes to prevent any eggs reaching the uterus.  It was definitely more invasive than getting me snipped, according to the doctors."
4570,"Those sound like Copays.  Perhaps geographic location and insurance coverage makes a HUGE  fucking difference.

It was quoted at 1100-1200 dollars.  Perhaps you don't know a fucking thing about what you're talking about.  Cunt stain."
4571,"I see the issues. Thats interesting, i git a perspectivr from a canadian living here and he at least painted a better picture of coverage up there. I see how the system down here could be enticing for canadian doctors. If theyre getting paid by the government, do the doctors gey lucrative pensions there? 

My father is a surgeon in the us, but he agrees with the cincept of socialized heallthcare, but is also concerned by the idea of being paid not at the premium he currently is. As I understand it, the US system is mostly costing more for the cost of bs administration and insurance companies. I feel as though when we socialize medicine your physicians salaries will become more competitive and even the situation out.

  Although, I guess its still a more progressive system than here. Lol "

4580,"My understanding is that HPV, while it can cause complications for men, is much more likely to cause problems for women who are infected."
4581,"It is a ""women's issue"" because the genesis of the HPV vaccine was in cervical cancer research and the early trials and approvals were managed through the gynecology space. 

It was easier to sell a vaccine for HPV to the public while referencing cervical cancer because heterosexual PIV sex is more widely accepted than anal or oral sex (heterosexual or homosexual).

But HPV is a public health issue. It causes cancer in both men and women. The vaccine should be properly tested for both children and adults of both genders and should be equally available to both genders."
4582,"HPV vaccine (Gardasil) was developed originally for women to treat cervical cancer as HPV causes cervical cancer.

Then they found it was useful for men to prevent penile cancer after that.

So it was a woman's issue because originally it was thought to be for women only.

Though $340 is nothing compared to preventing cancer, even if the risk is very low."
4583,"This is not just a women's issue. HPV is oncolytic and is responsible for  70% of cervical cancer. Women getting vaccinated against HPV can prevent cervical cancer, while men getting vaccinated reduces the risk of passing it on to unvaccinated partners. Oralpharayngeal cancer has been seen on the rise, and the HPV strain that causes this type of cancer is the same as the ones that cause cervical cancer. However, when you get vaccinated with Gardasil, you are getting vaccinated against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, 16 and 18 being responsible for causing most of cervical cancers.

If you live in the US and are under the age of 27, health insurance is supposed to cover the 3 vaccine shots for Gardasil. The age dependency might be different based on your insurance."
4584,HPV is specifically linked to high rates of Cervical cancer.
4585,"Well, we do tend to have much higher rates of cervical cancer. 

HPV very rarely causes cancer. About 9,000 cases of all types in men, but 10,000 cases of cervical cancer alone in women, who suffer from HPV related cancer at about twice the rate as men.

These are smaller numbers we're dealing with here, but I agree that logically it should be issued to all people regardless of cancer or gender. 

Now aside from the cancers genital warts are a big part of the HPV shot, which does disproportionately affect women. There are some other related health complications as well. "
4586,[removed]
4587,"Currently yes, but oral cancer rates in men are going up up up.  HPV related oral cancer in men has already surpassed all other types of oral cancer including smoking and alcohol."
4588,It is far more likely to cause cancer in women than men. Eliminating HPV will nearly eliminate cervical cancer.
4589,Because it's like breast cancer; men can get it too but it's not nearly as risky or life threatening. 
4590,Yes.  Dramatically.  It's my understanding that all cervical cancer comes from HPV infections.  But HPV does not always lead to cancer.
4591,I think it's a money issue. The way Healthcare is setup in the country is stupid. I'm sure many of the people that are mad about this are also against single payer.

If it had been made optionally available for free there probably wouldn't have been an uproar."
4611,"Since you didn't get the other side of the story, only the smear:

1. The governor got some kind of legal bribe from the drug company to make it mandatory for all school-aged girls. Campaign contributions or whatnot.
1. The vaccine was paid for out of the school budget.
1. They made it very hard to opt-out. (Right here, I think we flunk the ""informed consent"" rule.)
1. At the time, the vaccine wasn't particularly well-tested. Instead of rolling it out to the general population in mass quantities wouldn't it make more sense to roll it out slowly first on high-risk individuals and see if there are any side-effects that didn't show up during the drug company's trial? Oh, but that wouldn't make them as much money as a lucrative contract.

Seriously, if there was a vaccine for HIV on the market *tomorrow,* would you rush out and take it? While HIV is a horrible thing to catch, I'm a heterosexual, non-IV drug user in a monogamist relationship, which pretty much puts me in the lowest risk pool. There are plenty of higher risk people out there that can't or won't force themselves into the lowest risk group and where the gamble on a brand new vaccine that has passed trials and has been approved by the FDA is worth it. Are you the type of person willing to stick a needle in my arm (or have it done via proxy, so your hands stay clean) ""for my own good""? Really?

(I'd like to emphasize that I'm *not* a crazy anti-vaxer. Have you gotten this year's flu shot yet?)

4615,"There was a local uproar in RI recently when the health department made RI the first state to require it in teenage girls. The crazies came out of nowhere claiming it causes autism, blindness, etc. 

The only point that I can see that the detractors have is that this vaccine protects from an STD, which is different than treating the typical viruse like polio or measles, which more easily spreads through non-sexual contact .  A teenager has to choose to have sexual relations to get  the HPV virus. They can't get it from their classmate coughing near them. If a vaccine existed for other STDs, would we go around mandating preemptive vaccination for teenagers for those as well? Or would we just advise them to use condoms, practice abstinence etc? 

So that makes me lean more towards the side that said it  should be a highly recommended choice, but not a state mandate."
4616,"I don't think the reaction was entirely idiotic. With the exception of putting people in quarantine for things like ebola I am staunchly against forcing medical procedures on the public. Especially onto children.

I'm not an anti-vaccer and have had all my vaccines and will get them for my offspring if I have any. However, just because someone isn't vaccinated doesn't mean they are a threat to the entire rest of society and that sentiment is nothing more than fear mongering propaganda. The people that it does affect are the small number of unvaccinated people.

I consider vaccinations as nothing more than an extension of human invention. However, because that is the case, I would not force it on the public and consider them to be a privilege and not a right. I don't believe technological advancements should ever be considered a necessity for human survival then forced on the public.

Regardless of why people are not vaccinated, I see no reason for their supposed safety to come before the rights of the individual. These people will have to live with the elevated chance of getting sick and I would not impose on others just to reduce this risk.

Stop letting fear mongering strip away our rights for the supposed safety of others. Soon we'll have laws that ban food products just because too many people are fat and don't care about what they eat as long as it tastes good. Oh...wait, we already do that with trans-fat bans."

Incorrect. That's not how probability works. There will be a risk factor assigned to each person, and the average risk for the group would reflect the average risk for each member. 

You might think a larger group's diseases would spread slower (if each member's risk was the same as the smaller group's), but you're forgetting that the larger group would have more available infected people to spread that disease.

Saying that diseases propagate through small communities faster is like saying that someone from a small group of people is more likely to win the lottery than someone from a large group of people. It's nonsense- the chance applies at the individual level and the number of people in the individual's group will not change the individual's chance.

To simplify it, if a person in Rhode Island has a 1 in 1000 chance of winning the lottery, an individual would have the same chance of winning as a person in China that has a 1 in 1000 chance.

Furthermore even though the hookup culture due to social media has increased the level of promiscuity along with feminism, anti-slut shaming, positive views on sexuality and positive body reinforcement homosexual men still do out fuck heterosexual men, just look at the case of the guy who was deliberately spreading HIV. He fucked 30 men and filmed the acts all under 4 months, no straight guy unless he is a celebrity(more exposure, people willing to fuck you without the necessary meet and greet) can accomplish the same in that kind time frame even including the college demographic.

The $340 cost quoted here is the non-subsidised, i.e. actual, cost of the vaccine. It's not a premium for males. 

I'm an Australian woman who missed out on free Gardasil vaccination when it was first offered by our government because I just missed the cut-off age of 26. I was pretty bummed about it, but was in an exclusive LTR at the time, so didn't strictly 'need' it then, anyway. Still, better to be safe than sorry, and I did hold slim hopes that the vaccine would cure me of these tiny warts I'd had around my knuckles for several years at that time. (Still do.)

Unfortunately, the full cost for the course of three doses required would have been around $450 in total, so I never did end up getting it. One day, I hope I'll be able to, even if I do have to pay outright for it myself. I will gladly accept it free of charge for my daughter once she's old enough, and certainly hope by then my son will also be offered the shots for free, too, but if not, I'll pay the full amount regardless.

Vaccines are expensive. Most people can only access them because their government is footing the cost. The government has deep pockets, but not infinitely deep pockets, so offering free universal vaccination is not always feasible for every available vaccine."

Even without immigration, the /u/Nathan346 method doesn't protect the vast majority of women for many decades. And, since it turns out that the vast majority of the medical harm due to HPV afflicts women, it makes sense to just go ahead and vaccinate the women.

It's pretty damn easy to get them to okay it for guys though (my state covers for both). The line: ""By vaccinating him you're protecting any girlfriends he may have in the future from genital warts and cervical cancer."" has almost never failed me. 

This is a virus that causes serious harm to the population that could be gotten rid of in the next decade if all teens were vaccinated like they should be. It would basically mean the end of cervical cancer. And to give everyone an idea of how common HPV is, it's the reason doctors stopped doing pap smears before 21 and often ignore scary findings on the first one. Essentially every sexually active person who has not been vaccinated has some form of HPV.

People still don't trust vaccines, and are woefully backward about sexual health. If people are unwilling to vaccinate their daughters (who are the most at-risk for HPV-related health complications), then I imagine they'd be equally or more unwilling to vaccinate their sons.

>If it's just something everyone gets, it might lower the stigma plus a girl not vaccinated will having a lower risk if more males are.

You're right, if they were going for herd immunity, it would be better to vaccinate everyone.  But they can't afford it.  Now, maybe they need to find more funding, distribute money in a different way, etc.  That's all another discussion.

Point is, they only have enough money to vaccinate girls for free right now.  Since the disease affects women more than men, since it kills 3500+ women a year, it makes sense if you have a limited budget to target the most at-risk population, in hopes of preventing some of those deaths."

4789,"A very slightly inflamed lymph node came and went a couple times over the course of about 3 weeks concurrent with the rest of my family having minor head colds, then I woke up and my neck was HUGE. Seriously. A plumb bob from the farthest point from the outside of my ear would have hit my neck. I went to the ER and imagery showed a swollen and infected something - probably a lymph node - was impeding my airway. Immediate IV antibiotics and surgery the next day to incise and drain the infection, which proved to be common staph, not MRSA. They couldn't remove the lymph node because it was the jugulodigastric node which is bound to the interior carotid artery and is too deep and risky to remove. They could, however, nick it from the side, drain it and rinse it out with antibiotics. I then spent 4 days in the hospital on IV antibiotics and then oral followup. Healing was going excessively slowly, so my ENT ordered an FNA biopsy. Biopsy revealed SCC, followup pathology revealed HPV to be the cause, PET scan showed where it was and all the specifics. Basically, it started in my tonsils, grew into surrounding tissues in my throat and eventually deposited and grew in my jugulodigastric node. I had no idea and no symptoms until the necrotic part of my lymph node was being devoured by a staph infection. Ugh.
Surgery removed my tonsils, but left tendrils in my throat and my metastatic site was inoperable. The SCC that was left got burned out by carefully administered radiation around my carotid artery and other sensitive structures in my neck.
The treatment sucked and so do the lingering side effects, but I still thank modern medicine everyday."

The last time if flared up I couldn't get in to see the ENT so I made an appointment with a different one, this one at Medical Center of Virginia.

edit: [I explain why I'm pretty sure about this in a follow-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3lahv8/hpv_vaccine_should_be_free_for_boys_says_mother/cv4raqh)

In America?  Well, I'm doing some googling.  In the United States, both Medicaid and Affordable Care Act programs cover the full 3-step HPV vaccination process (which seems to have been approved for boys only 4 years ago) without patient co-pay.  Meaning that they're free for most Americans, at least in the states that have taken up the Medicaid expansion.  

There are a number of states (all headed by Republican governors) that have turned down Federal money to expand Medicaid, there are significant people who make too little to qualify for subsidies for private health insurance but make too much to receive Medicaid for their families.  I live in one of those states, and me and my friends are not ""slacktivists"" as the other response suggested, a large group of us are engaged with organizations pressuring our state government to adopt the Medicaid expansion, as well as other issues.  I can promise you that Medicaid expansion here is framed as, among other things, a women's issue.

Big-picture in the US the issue with vaccination rates is an issue of persuasion, outreach, and choice, not availability or funding.  HPV vaccination, especially in boys, is one of those things where poor people have higher rates of participation and completion than rich people, for all the stupid reasons you imagine, plus that schools and doctors that serve poor people have a more public health perspective rather than ""what is perfect for your special snowflake"" perspective.  So, in this case, one of the most effective things an American feminist can do to encourage HPV vaccination in boys is to, yes, get on Facebook and talk about the issue.

As for big feminist organizations, Planned Parenthood is actively working with the Center For Disease Control (which, living near Atlanta, and being active in politics, I can tell you is quietly a pretty feminist organization) to increase vaccination rates in both boys and girls."
4852,"They are too busy arguing that women should never have to go to jail.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/11/06/we-should-stop-putting-women-in-jail-for-anything/"
4853,"Please all me to mansplain this to you: they have better things to do like protesting against manspreading, or lobbying to ban bossy."
4854,"Planned Parenthood is a strong supporter of public healthcare and is working to improve vaccination rates in both boys and girls.

The article in question is about Canada.  In America, the HPV vaccines is covered by both the ACA and Medicaid.  So the issue (like a lot of issues pertaining to vaccination) here is about voluntary participation, not public funding.

So people on Facebook encouraging their friends to have their sons vaccinated are actually directly addressing the most fundamental issue at stake.

Nice try."
4855,"I'm not about to pester my personal friends with accusations from a stranger on reddit.  I'm sure you have plenty of experience finding feminists on the internet and confronting them.

As to the two links you provided, I'll talk about the second one first.  It is an article from the ""International Business Times,"" a publication I had not previously heard of.  Let's look at the [IBT](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/).  The front page has no advertising.  This is immediately suspicious.  Digging deeper, IBT Media is a new media holding company that owns a lot of different outlets, including the relaunched Newsweek(!) interesting, I'll file that away for later.  All this means is that their main site is going to be hard to pin down as to what exactly its biases and revenue model are.

The author of this piece, Mike Buchanan, is the chair of  Justice for men & boys, which appears to be a political party, rather than a non-profit or NGO.  The political mainstream ignores fringe single-issue parties for all sorts of very good reasons.  So that's a giant red flag right there.  This is his only piece for the International Business Times, and the bottom of the piece contains the disclaimer ""The views expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect those of IBTimes UK."" - translation: the editors of the site did no fact-checking and it's quite likely the IBT were paid to run the piece.

This is essentially a very well promoted blog piece, not any sort of work of journalism.  Now this does not completely discredit it on its own, the author is going to have to work a little harder for credibility than an established journalist would.  The article isn't good.  It's a shotgun argument, throwing dozens of statistics, unverified statements, and a couple of citations at the wall, and seeing what sticks.  The argument that it's dancing around: that women's organizations are systematically denying access to suicide-prevention efforts to men, is never actually made.  I looked at the study he says his party published (his party is mentioned nowhere in the credits of the study) is a bibliographic survey, not the kind of thing that can be easily argued with in a short time, as it is just a list of hundreds of articles.  The other study, in a journal too small for my university's library to carry, has been cited a grand total of one times.

His top tweet is a rape joke and pretty much his whole feed is call outs of ""feminazis.""  Also, I know local comedians and radio hosts who have a bigger twitter presence than this guy, who claims to head some national-level political party.

In short: this is not the sort of thing I pay much attention to, but I wanted to take the time to explain why.  Anyone can say anything on the internet and you have to develop a good credibility filter, otherwise you'll spend all your time arguing with fools and liars.  He fails mine.

Ignoring him, and his shit article, and the questionable publication it appears in.  Male suicide being disproportionate to female suicide: is that a problem?  Yes, I think it absolutely is.  I don't know much about the UK, but in America, the suicide rate is much too high, and it skews male.  My personal opinion on why that is is tied into my views on guns (gun-ownership is the single greatest determining factor as to if a suicidal person will successfully kill themselves, by a very large margin).  But I'm not a mental health researcher, and can't really speak to it with any great authority.

The first of the two articles you cited is more credible.  It's published in the Weekly Standard.  Now I have no love of that publication, they were some of the loudest drum-beaters in support of George W. Bush and the Iraq War.  And in my mind, they have blood on their hands.  But so does the New York Times, who publish at least a few writers I like, so that's not an automatic DQ.  While they definitely have a bias I don't share, they are within the world of mainstream journalistic credibility, at least as it is defined in the modern era.

Unlike Mike Buchanan, the author of this piece Christina Hoff Sommers is a significant public figure who has authored a couple of significant books criticizing modern feminism.  I'm not a big fan of hers (obviously) and I think she's somewhat intellectually dishonest.  There's a good amount of criticism of her work by academics that is not generally accessible if you don't have access to a university library.  Here's a pretty good [counter-article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/books/reviews/waragainstboys0703.htm) to her book The War Against Boys.  Basically she cherry-picks her references and flat-out ignores real work done by feminist organizations advocating for disadvantaged boys.

As to this article itself, she's doing a lot of the same.  My big criticism is it's turning the kind of crazy politics of the first two years of Obama's presidency, the bail-out, the stimulus, and all sorts of overlapping conflicts into a single-issue argument.  Unemployment rate is not a good statistic to compare labor economic effects across gender lines.  Women and Men respond to layoffs in different ways.  This is a really complicated subject, but Work Force Participation Rate is a much better statistic.  Basically, when someone stops looking for work, and either moves back in with their family, starts engaging in off-the-books employment (be it baby sitting or drug dealing or anything in between), goes on welfare, marries for money, etc. etc. they stop being ""unemployed"" and are just no longer counted in that statistic.  ""Unemployment"" measures what percentage of the population are looking for work and can't find it, ""Work Force Participation"" measures what percentage of the whole population has jobs.

For a lot of reasons, women don't stay in the looking-for-work-but-can't-find-it list for as long as men do.  There are a few more socially acceptable non-working routes, not all of them terribly pleasant, for women than men.  Also women are more likely to compromise and switch career paths to generally-available jobs with little possibility for advancement.  A woman who gets fired from a corporate ladder job might switch to a position in child or elder care where getting a gob is relatively easy, but she abandons forever any real hope of the kind of career trajectory she once had.  A man might not take that compromise.

Again, the issue of gendered preferences in the labor market is a giant one, economists can and do spend their entire careers studying small facets of it.  My only point is that an argument advancing labor force gender discrimination that uses unemployment rate as a central argument is disingenuous from the outset.  She buries the fact that almost 60% of the new jobs created in that stimulus went to men by throwing around numbers from seemingly related statistics that actually measure different things.

The big lie in that article, though, is the greater political context.  The primary effort of the 2009 Obama Stimulus was funding Wall Street Investment Banking (a male-dominated field if there ever was one: 60-40 male, and the men are paid much more), under the assumption that investment would create jobs faster than direct hiring via the federal government.  I did not support this, and I think history has shown those of us who were against it to be correct.

The other big thing going on was that at the time of the stimulus, Obama was building a coalition to support his overhaul of the health care system.  People not grinding a men's rights axe who were looking at the stimulus at the time were of the opinion that the large amount of money that got diverted from construction work and into health and health services had quite a lot to do with buying support from the healthcare industry to get the money side of healthcare on board with the Affordable Care Act.  I suspect this was a bigger influence on the decision making going on than a women's lobbyist group holding a meeting where the chairs were (gasp) arranged in circles.

But also, I don't know if you were old enough to be in the workforce in 2008 & 9, it was a scary time.  The issue was not simply lost construction jobs (which was inevitable, the construction sector was hugely overinflated due to the housing bubble that had just burst, the second half of the Bush administration saw a wave of domestic construction that was simply unsustainable, even if there hadn't been a disaster, not all of those jobs were going to last) but if you graduated college in 2008 you were thrown into a job market where in some cases there were thousands of applicants for every single available job.  It was a nightmare.  ""Shovel ready"" blue-collar factory and hard-hat jobs sound great on the campaign trail, voters eat that shit up, but the reality was that just about the entire economy needed a boost and it would have been a mistake to only target a couple of sectors.  And again, as the author of this piece said but tried to discount, almost 60% of the new jobs went to men.

Anyway, that's my counter-argument to those two links.  I'm not going to go through someone's tumblr and debate every single post.  There's probably one or two in there that I might even agree with.  Like any large group of organizations, not every feminist group is right all the time about everything, and there are significant gendered issues facing men that deserves attention.  But the ""men's rights"" movement needs to pick its friends and spokespeople a little better.  Right now it largely resembles the 9-11 truther movement where a small number of slightly reasonable criticisms and questions are freely associating without any sort of self-policing or criticism with absolute insanity and deep bigotry."

4859,"Judging from the tenor of your comments in this thread, the stereotypical reddit keyboard warrior who turns literally every goddamn issue into a piss-fest about what feminism is/isn't doing. 

What if I told you...feminists have historically been at the forefront of advocacy for wider access to the HPV vaccine in both genders, in large part *because* it is so deadly to women? At the same time, statistical evidence indicates that when resources/funding are limited, it makes more sense to prioritize the vaccine for women over men. 

""including boys in an HPV vaccination programme generally exceeds conventional thresholds of good value for money, even under favourable conditions of vaccine protection and health benefits.""

http://www.bmj.com/content/339/bmj.b3884.long

That said, the CDC in USA does recommend it for men. I'm guessing the level of coverage varies by health plan. As a guy who identifies as feminist, who was able to get the HPV vaccine, I definitely agree that it would be *nice* if it were available to men for free as well...but I understand the logical arguments for why that's not always true. 

But yes, I'm sure your *pithy comment* was motivated by an understanding of the nuances of this situation, and not an appeal to the shallow anti-feminist jerkoff that seems to run through reddit. If you think this issue is so important, **what have you done personally to advocate for greater access to the HPV vaccine for men?** Why is it the job of ""the feminist movement"" (if such a vague phrase is even worth using) to convince you that it cares about every one of your pet issues?

However, it's beneficial to both genders for everyone to be vaccinated so it makes sense to have the vaccine be free for all, or at least cost the same amount."

4867,"I mean, what issues do you see feminists campaigning for in real life?  They're usually ones where there wasn't fair if any female representation in making the decision.  I feel like there was plenty of male representation in the process of making this decision.  Also, why aren't men's rights activists out there campaigning?  Why do the feminists have to fight your battles when they already have to fight their own?  Instead of saying nobody should fight for equality, maybe everybody should fight for equality."
4868,"> It's easy to post your feelings online. It's a different matter to see support groups actually campaigning, in real life, for what they claim.

Yeah, here would be outrage if the genders were flipped becasue that wouldn't make any sense. On vaccinate the low risk and low impact group and not the high risk high impact group? 



"
4875,"Well my opinion on the matter is that it is always easier to stand up for something that touches you as a person. Considering feminist groups are composed of mostly women, they tend to be doing less for men's rights than for women's. The solution would be that more men become feminists, and even the amount of people from each gender in the feminist groups, so that they can apply true equality.

I deeply believe that all feminists want equality, but the same way I'm against animal cruelty and won't do much to stop it other than "" post my feelings on the internet"" as you put it. But if someone throws something at me I will hit back. It's just a matter of being human, you react way easier for yourself than for others. It's about humanity, not feminists."

>There is clearly a wage gap, but differences in the life choices of men and women — such as women tending to leave the workforce when they have children — make it difficult to make simple comparisons.

>The administration’s back-up document for this statement asserted that “on average women generally make 23 cents on the dollar less than men.” But the White House is using a figure (annual wages, from the Census Bureau) that makes the disparity appear the greatest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, shows that the gap is 19 cents when looking at weekly wages. The gap is even smaller when you look at hourly wages — it is 14 cents — but then not every wage earner is paid on an hourly basis, so that statistic excludes salaried workers.

>In other words, since women in general work fewer hours than men in a year, the statistics used by the White House may be less reliable for examining the key focus of the legislation — wage discrimination. Weekly wages is more of an apples-to-apples comparison, but it does not include as many income categories.

>Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis surveyed economic literature and concluded that “research suggests that the actual gender wage gap (when female workers are compared with male workers who have similar characteristics) is much lower than the raw wage gap.” They cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department, which concluded that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap dwindled, to about 5 cents on the dollar.

4964,"If men start developing penile or anal lesions, it's more visible than a lesion on the cervix of a woman.  This means that in boys the lesions are more likely to be caught early and treated before they're serious.  If a woman isn't getting regular pap smear, any cervical cancer will probably be very advanced and invading surrounding tissue before it's detected.

The issue is that it's only costing the boys to get the prevention, which is sexist no matter how you look at it, but the *real* issue is that they explicitly said ""this won't be a problem for heterosexual boys"", meaning they want boys to pay for it because they refuse to help homosexuals stay healthy."
4979,"It's the oral cancer rates for men that may make it worthwhile as a public health program. There are only a little over 700 new cases of HPV related penile cancer per year  (in the US) so from a strict cost perspective, widespread vaccination is probably costlier than treating those cases. Now of course, from a personal perspective, $300 is always better than cancer. "
4980,"Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe I heard explanations that if your female partner has been vaccinated for it, then the likelihood of the male partner developing any sort of cancer from the virus is extremely low as the woman has protected herself from contracting the virus.

Does this mean that the male will essentially never be able to contract the virus (assuming they are in a monogamous relationship) and develop any sort of cancer directly caused by it? What I'm trying to say is... if the female has been vaccinated, are the male partners generally safe from contracting the virus completely?

No, it depends on your absolute risk.

> The American Cancer Society estimates for penile cancer in the United States for 2015 are:

> - About 1,820 new cases of penile cancer diagnosed
> - About 310 deaths from penile cancer

> Penile cancer is rare in North America and Europe. It occurs in less than 1 man in 100,000 and accounts for less than 1% of cancers in men in the United States.

Source: http://www.cancer.org/cancer/penilecancer/detailedguide/penile-cancer-key-statistics

If 1,820 cases are diagnosed per year, and there are 160 million men in the US, the odds of getting penile cancer each year is about 1 in 100,000, or about 75 in 100,000 in your lifetime. $340 is a lot of money to decrease your chance of cancer by 0.075%. Further, I have checked on getting the HPV vaccine, and they told me it would cost $700. If penile cancer kills 310 men each year, and let's assume that 100% of penile cancer is caused by HPV (which I'm sure isn't true), and [the average age of diagnosis is 68](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/penilecancer/detailedguide/penile-cancer-risk-factors), and let's assume it kills those men 10 years earlier than they would've died otherwise, it means the $700 guardasil shot would save you less than half a day of life (based multiplying 10 years x your chances of getting dying from penile cancer in the first place). Heck, you'll probably waste a few hours of your life just to get the shot - since it requires three visits."
4983,"No matter how effective and smart it is to get that shot, there are plenty of families that cannot even imagine affording $340 for it.

Sad, but true."

5000,"The biggest problem with Texas mandating the vaccine was that HPV is not spread through casual contact.

It is reasonable to mandate vaccinations against polio, measles, whooping cough, and other diseases that can be transmitted by simply being in close proximity to an infected student. A child should be able to sit in class without having to worry about the kid next to them sneezing and spreading mumps. 

HPV is transmitted by more intimate contact. Contact that (IMHO) should not be taking place inside the classroom. Based on this distinction, I don't think it is a state's prerogative to mandate the HPV vaccine.

Don't get me wrong...my son WILL be getting the HPV vaccine. But I don't think that it should be mandatory."

Oh, but that wouldn't make them as much money as a lucrative contract.

We don't care that unvaccinated people will get sick and die, many people say good riddance.  But they are most certainly a risk to EVERYONE.  Even if you are vaccinated you can still get many of the diseases if it is allowed to mature in an unvaccinated person.  That's why we fucking care.

If the population is 20 people the chance of selecting the infected individual is 1 in 20.   Population size absolutely matters.  There are of course other factors at work, but neither anal sex nor a culture of not using condoms are unique to the gay male population.   

Edit:  Also, this is why you see outbreaks of things like viral meningitis which have little to do with condoms or anal sex spread rapidly through small social networks like bathhouse goers in New York.  "

The reason AIDS is a bigger issue in the gay community is that they have many of these issues cascading on each other. Condomless anal sex, anonymous sex,  a higher percentage infected and a smaller group of potential partners combine to the numbers we see today, where 5% of the population accounts for 50% of new HIV infections.

It's not as strange as it sounds. Remember that each person can account for more sex than their percentage of the population. It's technically possible for only 2 people (which might be .00001%) to account for 100% of the sex in that community.

I think behaviour-based deferrals for both heterosexuals and homosexuals (i.e. use of protection during sex, type of sex, promiscuity, injection drug use, etc.) should be policy rather than focusing on sexuality but HIV incidence is still higher among homosexual men than other groups.

* The CDC says promiscuity is a factor in this but I can't find a single study talking about heterosexual vs homosexual promiscuity that wasn't written by some ""Family Science"" rag. 
* Anal sex is simply [more risky](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/risk.html) due to [biological factors](http://www.catie.ca/fact-sheets/prevention/hiv-transmission-overview) (thin membrane in the anus / rectum). 
* [Stigmatization may also be another factor](http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2814%2961193-4/fulltext) (stigmatization decreases likelihood of doctor visits which prevents infected people from being diagnosed).

In Canada, [we have recently changed the deferral period to 5 years](https://www.blood.ca/en/msm) from ""indefinite"" for males who have sex with males (MSM). Unfortunately, this is not based on science (generally 3 month non-detection period for HIV) but seems to be some kind of appeasement strategy for both sides. 

Hopefully this policy was meant as a foot in the door but because it has no scientific foundation, we will see how it develops when they reevaluate in the next 1-2 years."

5125,"But women aren't just getting HPV from the air. We get it from men we have sex with. In that regard, men should be vaccinated for the simple reality that they are disease vectors, that spread the virus, that causes a common female cancer. "
5126,"This is true however girls would also benefit from most men being vaccinated (herd immunity). Also, while other cancer types caused by HPV are much rarer they do happen. Men can get penile, throat, and anal cancers from HPV infection."
5127,"This is exactly the point I was trying to make. I gave a senario that almost 100% covers all the issues and yet still the point can't even be aknowledged. The only way a woman can get it is if she has sex with a guy that has hpv right? A guy can get it from a guy who has hpv. The likelihood of a girl giving it to another girl is very low. So, everyone would be covered. But because it is a different view point it's ""anti feminist"" "
5128,"That's not really the issue.  The point being made is that if all males are vaccinated, or all females are vaccinated, then the straight members of the opposite gender are also protected.

The question is therefore whether it's easier for unvaccinated women who have sex with women to spread the disease to each other or whether unvaccinated men who have sex with men to spread the disease to each other.  If transmission is easier among gay men than among gay women then it makes more sense to vaccinate all men than to vaccinate all women.

Of course this assumes a 50/50 gender split in the population, but you get the idea."

5135,"It was an argument for the sake of an argument, as well as to prove a point. It's very important women get this vaccine, however it is just as important as men get it as well, since they could be a life long carrier and never know it. Ever. Men have more partners and are more promiscuous than women also, so a man who doesn't know he has it could spread it. If a woman gets it, she can be tested and recieve treatment, as well as not have sexual partners and further spread it. Men just never know. "

If spending the money will save us more money, we spend the money on it. We don't even need to consider other treatments, merely the cost of capital and the time discount. 

Further because the vaccine protects against some strains very well and other related but distinct strains acceptably, those other strains are better protected against with a fully vaccinated cohort.

Whats more because inevitably not all women will be vaccinated, either due to allergies, missing the scheduled time, immigration from a different country, vaccinating men improves the immunity of the whole group by introducing more breaks in the chain."

You're also ruling out lesbians. HPV can be contracted orally and spread to genitals. 

(Reluctantly indulging..) Women have a biological predisposition to be more vulnerable to a certain infection than men and thus are given aid to help combat this. Part of gender equality is understanding the special needs of both men and women individually.

That being said, men (and women) can still contract throat cancer. However, throat cancer (via HPV) is contracted at about 3/5ths the rate cervical cancer is contracted. 

If anything, apply that 3/5ths to the total sum coverage of $300 and split it, or make it $150 each.

5184,"women get cancers from it about twice as often and the treatments for women are for more invasive and life changing.  they have to dig out the cancer ridden womb, so no children for the girl who gets it during teenage years, which is the higher risk period.  and while cancer still sucks for men, their treatments aren't as life changing and after men recover they can go on to lead a perfectly normal life with no changes(unless they got it really super bad and barely survived).  "
5185,"If she expects to have 4 partners, and we immunized just 1 of those, it would reduce her exposure by 25% and the exposure of his other partners by 100%.

Every potential person immunized exponentially reduces the rate of transmission to the non immunized population, regardless of their sex. "
5186,"Also men who get HPV can have permanent genital warts and throat cancer, not 'sick for a few days.' Vaccinating this virus should be no different than vaccinating for polio and measles. It should be done to everyone to protect society as a whole, which protecting that in my opinion is priceless."

5203,"That's not normally true.

If a wart is removed by freezing or other means, the virus is gone completely. You might be thinking of HSV (Herpes Simplex) which hides in nearby nerve cells.

5209,"Ok, but at this point you're making a very broad complaint about what happens when lots of people with competing interests get together and try to make decisions.  Of course those decisions aren't the most efficient ones, but they are the reality of how bureaucracies work.  Even with inefficiency and waste, there is still an attempt to make the best choices.  The people making these decisions actually do care about the outcomes.  They aren't just throwing darts at a board, and while there may be some corruption involved that's certainly not representative of most of the money."
5210,[deleted]
5211,"Right and the Canadian government determined that vaccinating all males would cost more money than taking care of the ones who do get it. 

It may not be right but that's how they decide."
5212,"The hope is that vaccinating women will also reduce the cancer rates in men. If all women are vaccinated, then all straight men will also be protected, so HPV in men will also go down. So all women and straight men, something like 90% of the population would be protected. If it were half of all men and half of all women, only the vaccinated half would be protected. "
5213,"It's more a question of cost than technology. If you have a free healthcare service that doesn't have an unlimited budget, you inevitably end up with trade-offs. It becomes a question of how to best spend the money you have.

So, with HPV, vaccinating men is saving half as many lives as vaccinating women -- but it costs the same amount. 

As an example (with made up figures):

Vaccinating women against HPV will save 1000 lives for $1000.  
Therefore, vaccinating men against HPV will save 500 lives for $1000.  
Meanwhile, vaccinating against Disease X will save 700 lives for $1000.  

Now, if you have $3000, it's all good. But if you only have $2000, the reasonable choice is obvious enough (assuming we consider all lives equal).

So that's a simple demonstration of how it can make sense to vaccinate women without it necessarily meaning we should also vaccinate men. In an ideal world, we would vaccinate everyone against HPV. In reality, every free healthcare service has people dying who could be saved with a larger budget."
5214,Men already have a lower chance of contracting the virus and are less likely to suffer negative consequences of contracting it.  It does not make sense to provide the vaccine for them and not women rather than the other way around.
5215,">Take the HPV away from those that can transmit it through both anal and vaginal sex, and it's gone much quicker than if taken away from that can only transmit it vaginally!

I don't understand, you think one gender is unable to have anal sex?"
5216,"Gay men are a very small percentage of the population.  When the options are ""protect most people"" and ""protect nobody"", it's not a hard decision.  Additionally, if HPV is not common in the general population it will provide some protection for MSM as there is some overlap.  It is similar to how widespread vaccination provides some protection even for communities that do not vaccinate for religious or other reasons.  Of course it would be best if the government payed for everyone to get vaccinated, but that would require additional resources that perhaps could be better spent elsewhere.  There are innumerable important public health initiatives that need money."
5217,"No, it leaves the very small percentage of MSM at risk, and the generally lower incidence of infection in the population as a whole will still decrease their risk.  There are limited resources, therefore resources are applied where they will do the most good for the most number of people.  It's not ""fair"", but it is the right choice."
5218,"HPV is primarily transmitted when a man and a woman have sex. By immunizing a woman, you have disrupted this transmission.

How is this different from normal diseases like the measles? Measles is indiscriminate in who it is transmitted to. There isn't a secret handshake that must occur between two parties. In this case, an infected patient will threaten anyone.

In the case of HPV, an infected patient will (theoretically) only threaten the sex they are attracted to. Since most people are heterosexual, by vaccinating the majority of women, we have disrupted the main highway that HPV uses. Thus herd immunity is achieved."

5220,"100% agree with you, the issue I have with it is the defense of ""cost-benefit analysis"" is commonly employed when it fits an already defined narrative but then dismissed when it doesn't. "
5221,"Men work longer hours and are less likely to stop their careers to have a family. Also they tend to retire later and gravitate towards higher paying and more competitive jobs.

> almost 60% of the new jobs went to men

I dodn´t knew much about  Mike Buchanan but I first read his first article on yahoo news so I didn´t bother checking his facts facts but the overall statement he tired to make is I think that governments tend to care less about men then wome. it is a fact that the us government spents more money for women´s health then for men.


breast cancer research for example receives more then double then prostate for more than several decades even through both affect men at the same rate as women and yearly more men die on prostate cancer then women die on breast cancer.

https://katatrepsis.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/us-funding.jpg

http://fundedresearch.cancer.gov/nciportfolio/stats.jsp

so his statment that the state seems to care in generally less about men compared to women seems fair. My question is why is this the case. Like Neil Lyndon pointed out in this article if women were effect at the same rate their would be a public out cry but because it affects just men we tend to not care.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/active/mens-health/11377311/If-as-many-women-killed-themselves-as-men-wed-never-hear-the-end-of-it.html

as for your criticism for Christina Hoff Sommers I want go into to much detail because I also don´t know much about here (I haven´t even read her book) but it can´t be denied that girls are out performing boys in school yet and collages for years now as seen in overall marks and collage sex ratio but the governments all around the world still seems to only care about improving the education for girls only as can be seem by the fact that the white house only has a council for girls education but none for men or by the fact that the U.N. Gender Inequality Index actually marks down countries if boys and girls have the same educational opportunity. Again I really wonder why this is the case? 

My guess is because everytime people try to do something about it they get accused of sexism and shut down

It's a nice thought, that we can focus on liberating and empowering women, and men will be liberated as a by-product, but the reality is falling far short.

Or at least that's how the men on reddit seem to feel, they feel more restricted than ever and feel feminism has a lot to do with that. Since you acknowledge that men's lives aren't perfect, can you acknowledge that critique in feminism's approach to equality for all?"

Its so very very hard to be a woman in the first world. If feminists actually do care about mens issues (they dont) then they should use all that accumulated money and power to help those who need it. Be a male ally while demanding men be allies to women. 

>Instead of saying nobody should fight for equality, maybe everybody should fight for equality.

Maybe one side could actually start fighting for equality and not supremacy and hand outs."
5280,">Why do the feminists have to fight your battles when they already have to fight their own?

Because they claim to fight battles for both sexes. "
5281,"Some actually do, but every time they try people just yell out about them being misogynists because MRA == literally patriarchal Hitler or is the same thing as redpill to some people and the whole thing gets shut down. Same thing happens to feminists.

But you're ultimately right--most people don't do things. Meanwhile the passionate ones (who are usually batshit crazy) do. That's why you see so much feminism hate. The rad fems do a thing, people bitch, non-rad fems talk about how they're not ""real"" feminists like they apparently are, cycle carries on. Same with MRA.

But look who did a thing and who didn't. Actions are louder than words, and the **""real""** MRAs and the **""real""** Feminists are inactive. They don't do things, and complain when other people do while the crazies enjoy their circle jerk. And this isn't unique to them. All groups do this.

So tired of it. "

5291,"That's interesting, what issue are straight men collectively supposed to go to bat over for gay men? pretty sure we just legalized gay marriage nation wide due to a male dominated supreme court and across many parts of the straight male dominated western world. Also LGBT i'm sure has a number of straight organization members campaigning for decades on behalf of the homosexual community, rarely do movements like these rely solely on the victims affected by the stigma, prejudice and religious hatred. Look for example our civil rights movement, if it were not for the jewish people who helped found naacp, rode with us on the freedom rides, marched and protested, even died alongside us we may not have accomplished all we did."
5292,"> Right now people here are complaining about the feminists not doing anything.

Yes, because feminists claim to be about equality and that they care about men's issues just as much as they care about women's.

You don't think it has anything to do with the fact that any men's rights groups that pop up are immediately labeled as misogynistic (though a fringe number of them are) and are dismissed out of hand as a group of chauvinists that want to keep women down?"

I'm completely for making this vaccine free for men.  The other self-identified feminist is completely for making this vaccine free for men.  I've never heard a feminist (and I know quite a few) say that medical bills for the same procedure should be higher based on gender.  Maybe we just had no idea that this was going on which is why there isn't a huge movement behind it?

And it looks like the ONLY reason it isn't provided to all boys as well isn't because of some evil, moustache-twirling cabal of feminists looking to screw men over.  It's because the state doesn't have enough money to vaccinate everyone, so they only vaccinate those who are at risk of symptoms.  I'm not saying it's right or fair or shouldn't be changed... but it's a reasoning that has nothing to do with feminists.

The whole underpinning of the trans phenomenon is idea that people feel a certain way about their gender, and that is more important than what would otherwise be compelling phyiscal evidence.  Their feelings cannot be objectively assessed by anyone other than that person, so we have to go with what they say.

At what point do we decide that what someone expresses as their feeling is genuine, as opposed to a possible temporary confusion, or even a deliberate ruse?  Does it have to be that way for a while?  What if it changes in the future?  "

5327,"Might be able to provide some insight. 

Alberta is, for the most part, conservative. The metro areas not as much as the rural. Calgary more so [conservative] than Edmonton.

Albertans in general just became disillusioned with the provincial conservative party, and I would say it began with Stemach, snowballed with Redford (mostly due to her excessive spending on personal travel/accommodations) and peaked with Prentice when he told Albertans to ""look in the mirror"" when referring to government financial deficits. He said this pretty much just before the provincial election and it came across as extremely condescending and insulting. I think they just became too entitled due to holding down the province for over 40 years and were completely out of touch with the voting population. They thought they would always have it in the bag no matter what, but they shot themselves in the foot and handed the election on a silver platter to the next best choice. Insert the NDP who ran a great campaign and Rachel Notley schooling an arrogant Prentice at the debate and the rest is history.

However, in the federal election I do see Alberta voting more conservative than we saw in the provincial election.

Hope I helped :)

Source: voting Albertan born and raised.

Edit: As others have pointed out, vote splitting also had an influence. Alberta has the right-wing Progressive Conservative party, and the far-right Wild Rose Party. Votes were, in some ridings, split between the two, giving the NDP the advantage."
5328,"Because in Canada, conservative means you are slightly left of Obama."
5329,I think having a lot of extra money in our budget allows Alberta to fund these social programs more easily. 
5330,"Calgary and Edmonton are filled with liberals(by ideology, not party) and progressive conservatives, giving a big showing at gay prides isn't too surprising when youre dealing with metropolises over a million people large. The NDP rode in on a massive vote splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and the Wildrose party, similar to how the federal conservatives have unified the right and the left is split between ndp and libs.

5334,"Nice try Canada. There is only one Texas, and it is not to be messed with."
5335,"Because the Conservative vote got split while the one liberal party got sizeable support that let them win many seats for a majority. 

Put both conservative party support together and it shows you still got a very conservative province. "
5336,"Lots of immigrants lately because of the oil rush. They brought ideas from elsewhere. Calgary's mayor is a progressive muslim frenchspeaker. 3 reasons to get lynched over there traditionally.

Furthermore, people there kind of finally realised that they were fed false promises by the conservatives about sacrificing now under the promise they will receive more later when things improve; for instance, a governemnt with no sales taxes and a huge surplus still slashing down school budgets just out of ideology, kind of makes you open your eyes.

But now that the oil bubble is collapsing, I am expecting trouble. And be certain it will all be blamed on the newly-elected progressive government."
5337,They voted NDP because they're frightened by low oil prices and don't know what to do.
5338,"Well, I meant relative to the rest of Canada, since public health care is a Canada wide thing. 

Alberta has lower taxes that most provinces, (No PST, lower business taxation, lowest corporate taxes of any province). Used Flat taxes (until very recently). Less regulations on businesses and exports. "
5339,"Prophylactic contraception prevents many diseases outside of HPV and Herpes (And even with those it helps lower the risk). That said, as this shows, as medicine advances there will be many more sexually oriented procedures, contraceptive or otherwise, sexual health shouldn't come down to gender lines. "
5340,"Of course I read it.  You were saying ""they should cover this procedure for men, but not others"".  And of course the government decides what should and shouldn't be available / paid for.

5350,"In fact, doesn't leaving half the population unvaccinated undermine much of the point of vaccination in the first place?

A virus that can get hosts is a virus that can mutate into something not affected by the vaccine. "
5351,Men can also spread it to other men.
5352,"The *other* problem is that this causes cancer in men too, at about half the rate of it in women.  

I understand the primary problem's gotta be about women, but don't forget men aren't just vectors for harming women with this.  They're also people who are at risk directly."
5353,You basically just described Herd Immunity which is a major cornerstone of vaccination policy and a big argument for why we should vaccinate as much of the population as feasible
5354,But... religious fruits believe that it promotes sex.  No way this safety measure is happening.
5355,"Yup, the same argument being made for male circumcision actually holds water for this vaccine."
5356,"The problem is also that it can cause various different cancers in males too, such as oropharyngeal, anal and even penile cancer. "
5357,"Are we sure the vector of transmission isn't going in both directions? Male to anyone, female to anyone with the common denominators being sexual, moist mucous membrane contact? Having taken care on radical head, face and neck flap pts in an ICU, these cancers are serious to me and I'd like to see more gender comparative data and likely ways HPV is passed on. I would guess that we are tackling only half the problem by vaccinating girls exclusively. I'm sure the evil pharmaceutical  companies would lobby for this. "
5358,"As someone in the gay community, I hate this way of thinking. Gay men need to be protected too, and vaccinating all the women will have no impact on protecting us."
5359,"Polio vaccines cost less than $5/dose, MMR (measles mumps and rubella) cost less than $20. HPV costs at least $100 per dose. That's a huge difference when you're talking about vaccinating 10's of millions of people. "

It's still an issue, but it's not about not protecting homosexual's. It's about protecting the majority with the available resources. 

I'm not saying it's not an issue, just that you are twisting the words, and interpreting them out of context."
5366,"That's a bit unfair. The reality is that the incidence of HPV related cancers in men is lower than women and the cost of screening for and treating these cancers in men is *much* lower. Public health programs have a limited amount of money to put towards funding vaccination programs, so they try to target the demographics where the vaccine is going to do the most good, especially when it is expensive. In contrast, if the HIV vaccine proves successful, low or no cost distribution programs will almost certainly be targeted toward gay men, do you consider that to be ""sexist"" too? 

Now, is there room to argue that, in the interest of fairness, these programs should be expanded to both sexes, even if it lowers the cost benefit ratio? Of course there is, but that doesn't mean that the initial programs were intentionally or malevolently discriminiatory.  "
5367,also it wouldn't be uncommon for a heterosexual man to catch it from an unvaccinated female
5368,"Yep, it's sexual discrimination no matter how you look at it.

Not unlike the free women's health clinics all over the country."
5369,"> Now of course, from a personal perspective, $300 is always better than cancer. 

And that's what we're interested in. People are risk averse. Cancer might have a low probability but the cost is enormous. If you die earlier than you expect, the cost is infinite.

$300 is a drop in the bucket compared to those costs."
5370,"Essentially  yes, but in practice this only works within a bubble where every female is vaccinated and only heterosexual sex occurs. "
5371,"

>No, it depends on your absolute risk.

No it depends on your utility function - we care (individually) about expected utility not expected value.

>If 1,820 cases are diagnosed per year, and there are 160 million men in the US, the odds of getting penile cancer each year is about 1 in 100,000, or about 75 in 100,000 in your lifetime. $340 is a lot of money to decrease your chance of cancer by 0.075%.

But what's the cost of cancer to an individual? Pretty goddamn high, I'd say.

> Further, I have checked on getting the HPV vaccine, and they told me it would cost $700. If penile cancer kills 310 men each year, and let's assume that 100% of penile cancer is caused by HPV (which I'm sure isn't true)

No but 100% of HPV caused penile cancer is caused by HPV. That's the cancer I'm talking about.


>and let's assume it kills those men 10 years earlier than they would've died otherwise, it means the $700 guardasil shot would save you less than half a day of life (based multiplying 10 years x your chances of getting dying from penile cancer in the first place).

Not only death but pain and opportunity cost associated with having cancer are wrapped into the cosr-benefit analysis of having cancer.

>Heck, you'll probably waste a few hours of your life just to get the shot - since it requires three visits.

And this tells me you're not very risk averse! But others are, and that's why they get the Gardasil shots (as I did)."
5372,Yeah I am sure it is covered by many or most insurance companies. 
5373,"It depends on some different factors, including whether or not your insurance will pay for it, which is often based on age. I looked into it and Planned Parenthood told me it would cost me about $700 - that's for me alone getting the vaccine."
5374,"Well I didn't say women only should get the vaccine, but the risk of things other than cancer is why it was women only. Additionally the ties of HPV to other forms of cancer is an evolving situation. At one point it was believed to only be tied to cervical cancer. 

It's the impact on genital warts and sexual health that is more disproportionate, and it's why they gave the shots to women. Also probably throw in some social attitudes but that's a discussion for another day. "
5375,"The relative risks of these types of cancer are different, too.  310 deaths a year from penile cancer vs. >4,000 a year from cervical cancer.  And that's in the US, where the HPV vaccine was only recently approved for use in young men.  Worldwide it's the second leading cause of cancer-related death, killing >300,000 women a year.  Of course men should get vaccinated to protect themselves, but the greater effect is going to be stopping the transmission of HPV to women.  And I don't think anyone is advocating that *only* women should get the vaccine."

We don't vaccinate children to make school safe for kids, we vaccinate to reduce the negative impact of disease on society as a whole. Deciding which diseases to prevent based on how we feel about their primary mode of transmission should not be acceptable.

And as sex is something you enter in to, any negative results are your own problem (again, from a conservative standpoint).

Also Both Gardasil 4 and Cervarix have demonstrated to offer some degree of cross protection against other strains.

Gardasil 9 is even better though and it's unknown how much cross protection *it* provides, and also it'll likely reduce the oral cancer risk by closer to 80% compared to 50-60% from Gardasil 4 (more important in men), anal cancer by 70-80% compared to 40-50% for Gardasil 4 (important for anyone having anal sex, particularly relevant to men who have sex with men) and cervical cancer by ~90-95% compared to ~80-85%.

They've done costs analysis on it, and while it'd be much better to treat 100% of women versus 50% of men and 50% of women (while obviously 100% for both being the best), realistically offering it to both girls and boys will have the greatest benefit because that means an increased *real life* vaccination rate.

If they made it a mandatory vaccine for schools like they have with many other vaccines, that would probably be best for everyone, but *meh*.

Targeted vaccines for men who have sex with men, bisexual men, and sex workers would also do wonders (they already have guidelines in place for men who have sex with men, but I believe it's not covered in Canada, although I could be wrong on that...

When there is massive production of something, then the overhead costs go down, so the price per unit drops.

So lets consider that each vaccinate on average has a 10% markup, when you consider that it's a volume of millions, thats a billion dollar business on a single product."

Now, ask yourself, if the disease affected men more than women, would a normal woman be fine with only boys getting the vaccine for free?

Men and women are affected differently by the strains of HPV which Gardasil is most effective against. The reasoning behind such discriminatory vaccination policies *is* based on gender, but it sure isn't arbitrary.

> Woman are not a ''better bet'' than vaccinating man

Yes, they are. Gardasil is marketed as a vaccine to prevent cervical cancer. *Preventing cervical cancer is the reason the government is funding the vaccine in the first place.* Men are not at risk of developing cervical cancer, only women are. Ideally, prevention of cervical cancer would include both immunising women against the virus which causes it (HPV) and also immunising men to prevent them being able to infect their female sex partners, but when costs  don't allow for this, selectively vaccinating the primary sufferers, i.e. women, is a ""better bet"", hands down."

5489,"Look at penile cancer vs cervical cancer diagnosis rates. Also for throat cancer (I'm in dental school, they push this like crazy):

Also HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas respond far better to treatment than HPV- (which is still a mystery, as fascinating as it is.) Throat cancer is probably an STD, maybe mostly through oral sex. A lot needs to be done to figure out the details of transmission and stuff. 

So are those diseases real? Yes. Is it a problem? Yes. But both are an extremely small problem compared to cervical cancer. As a male health care provider, I 100% stand behind vaccinating women and not men.

5509,"right it's the exact same argument, I think it's a better argument too since men are less likely to show any signs for having HPV than women.

A male is more likely to spread HPV to their partners because they don't show symptoms.

"
5510,"But not every boy will get the vaccine so you're leaving all women exposed to infection via the unvaccinated. Whilst the reverse is also true, that unvaccinated girls pose a threat to boys, the risk to women is much higher than it is to men"
5511,"What is the motivation for boys to get the vaccine, when they are less likely to be affected? Logic is great, but when talking about public health you also have to take into account what people will *actually* do. I am much more likely to get a vaccine if I think it will prevent me from getting a deadly form of cancer than the possibility that I might get a strain likely to cause cancer that I might pass on to someone else who then might eventually sometime get cervical cancer. "
5512,"HPV can spread in a lot of non-sexual ways too though. So I still think realistically it makes the most sense to vaccinate girls since they get a direct benefit if you have to choose between one or the other.
"
5513,"I think they're focusing on girls right now because women are more aware of the risks of HPV and more likely to be proactive about preventing it. Most sexually-active men I've talked to are unaware of HPV or don't think it affects them (like an old buddy of mine who thought it was crazy that so many of his girlfriends got cervical cancer), so I'd say they'd be unlikely to get the vaccine even if it were offered for free. Many mothers of boys would pass on it for the same reason - people are so wary of vaccines these days; I can see a lot of parents balking at giving their child a vaccine that they would consider unnecessary or mainly a benefit to others.  

Hell, it was hard enough to convince people to vaccinate their daughters because of the stigma of STIs. I remember when the vaccine was first released, many women refused it for their daughters because they were afraid it'd encourage them to be promiscuous and refused it for themselves because ""I'm not a slut, I don't need a vaccine.""

A lot of awareness campaigns later and people are finally on board with getting their daughters vaccinated, but that sort of demand hasn't caught up with males yet. By offering the vaccine for free to women (who are more aware of the risks of HPV and more greatly and immediately affected by those risks), they're trying to insure that more people take advantage of it now, rather waiting until men are convinced it's good for them too."
5514,"Sir, you're right, but I am sorry no one will care. The idea that men get something women don't is just politically unfeasible. We cannot, in this day and age, directly favor the male gender over the female gender. It's just the way things are. Not because you're not 100% correct in your idea and assessment but because it would be political suicide to even suggest it, for anyone in a position to do anything . 

Which would have to be a major political figure to enact something like that. Even if he had hard science, a great pitch and a wonderful rapport. It woulds still fail, just because it ""seems"" like they're protecting males over females.

I get what you're saying, Women get HPV from men, not other women. Men get HPV from other Men as well. If you protect all the Men, then you have indirectly protected all the women, as they no longer have a ""source"" of HPV to worry about. It's a perfect solution. You've protected EVERYONE but it won't be seen that way. It would be, ""Men ignore women to focus solely on themselves, who don't have any ill effects from HPV. While women are left to die of cancer, completely unprotected!""

I'm sorry that's true, but it is...

EDIT: I was thinking, even if someone like Hillary Clinton were to suggest it, she would be called a ""Gender Traitor'! Whereas some would listen to her that wouldn't listen to a male saying it. She would still be basically murdered politically."

Edit: I did fact check myself and per the CDC, women account for 21k new cases of HPV related cancer every year whereas men account for 12k (which was actually higher than I thought, so I learned something new) That doesn't take into account any diagnosis of HPV caused precancerous conditions. "

It's not ""just as"" important. The science (and economics) are clear. If you've only got vaccines for 1/2 the population, you give them to the women.

Thing is: this isn't a scarcity issue. There are enough vaccines. The issue is one of socialized medicine. The Canadian system is covering the cost for women, but requiring private citizens to cover the cost for men. This is silly.

5539,"Consider Polio, everyone in my parents' generation was vaccinated for it, but pretty much nobody in my generation was.  Because the vaccine was so effective, and because some worked tirelessly to make sure nearly everyone got it, the virus is nearly extinct.  Nobody needs the vaccine anymore because the chances of being exposed to the virus are so low.  HPV, which isn't nearly as virulent as Polio, could be wiped out in a couple of generations with broad application of the vaccine.

The argument anti-vaxers lean on is loosely based on the concept of herd immunity.  Herd immunity is achieved when a large enough percentage of possible hosts for the virus are vaccinated, thus limiting the potential of the virus to spread if it is introduced to a population.  Every individual that is not vaccinated potentially jeopardizes this herd immunity because they will become a carrier if they are exposed and spread the disease to others.  Anti-vaxers also tend to socialize with each other, so if one of them is exposed to a virus, they all will be.  And since all of them lack immunity, many of them will become sick and spread the disease to others.  The virus might even mutate and be able to infect individuals who were already vaccinated against the original strain.

Herd immunity works as long as a critical mass of the population are vaccinated, and as long as those who are not vaccinated are evenly distributed among the population.  By concentrating high numbers of unvaccinated individuals in a small area, anti-vaxers are negating the benefits of herd immunity and placing everyone else at risk."

That's not really the same.  In the case of the virus, you're talking about something that indiscriminately attacks whatever host it is exposed to, but is markedly more fatal in one gender than the other.

In the case of violent crime, you have a reasoning human being, making choices.  Some very violent people will never target a woman out of personal bias.  Others ONLY target women out of personal bias.  It's a much more complex issue than what you're painting.

Remember, we're talking about Canada, which has a universal healthcare system.  It's not the same as the US where people pay for different levels of care.

Perhaps it would be better if the money were reallocated so that everyone got the vaccine for free.  I'm not saying that shouldn't be an option.

But at the end of the day...this all has to be paid for.  And saying ""Sorry, you don't get this vaccine because the government has decided you can afford to pay for it"" isn't a solution I want to see.  That just opens the door for a similar sentiment with all of our healthcare, and that's not a road I want our country to go down.  I'm happy to pay my share into the medical system so that when I need medical care I don't need to worry about a huge bill afterwards."

If it is not close, the people saying that vaccinating men is too costly are right.

Additionally, your quote states that the percentages of **all cancer cases** are close. So if there are way more women cancer cases, or way more men cancer cases, the percentage of people getting sick would not be close - independent of fatality rates."

Try pubmed.org and look through peer reviewed articles and form an opinion. I'm not arguing that the possibility of single HPV clearance doesn't occur. But all HPVs increase cancer risk factors (it's why they are distinguished low vs high), and it looks like the potential for persistent or cancerous HPV is additive with repeated infection. This says to me that even if we lose the ability to detect a single infection on a given test, the result is likely all the same. HPV remains persistent in the sense that you're likely adding a +5-30% to the cancer risk on your life's scorecard with each exposure, regardless of duration of active infection.

 In either case, refusing to care about a health-related subject involving cancer risk is probably the wrong approach, even if the center for disease control want to make you believe they are truly controlling disease. "

So this boils down to a difference in viewpoint of the benefits of equality in opportunity or equality in outcome?  I support the former very strongly.  I'm against the latter when it discriminates."
5585,"> It's more a question of cost than technology. If you have a free healthcare service that doesn't have an unlimited budget, you inevitably end up with trade-offs. It becomes a question of how to best spend the money you have.

That is a reasonable explanation.  However I'm cynical.  If it isn't about sexism, explain this one to me.  I'm from the USA.  Under the ACA women's contraception is covered by law.  Men's contraception is not covered.  Therefore a fairly simple vasectomy cost me ~$1k out of pocket (because we didn't hit our annual out of pocket maximum that year) and a riskier, more expensive, and more resource intensive, more prone to follow-ups due to complications tubal ligation is covered for free in all circumstances.  Due to my experience, I assume the answer in both these cases is sexism."

The same doesn't hold true for HPV vaccinations.

When action is needed on women's issues, serious action is taken. We see predominant figures on news channels talking about the issue, petitions are made with hundreds of thousands of signatures, legislation crafted, marches and support, all the things I have already listed. You see it every time. Facebook accomplishes little in that respect. Never have I once seen a group of femnists take action on men's issues like this. Never once have I seen them on MSNBC talking about how men get shafted and how laws and rules need to change. Girls lacking in education? National campaign. Vaccines needed to prevent cancer in men? Like and share!

>You're asking, basically, ""Why aren't the people whose stances and methods I already don't agree with taking on this particular issue?""

1) CBC is more or less the Canadian equivalent of NPR and PBS, it has a significant liberal bias.

2) I'm kind of suspicious of the fact that she's just labeled as a ""mother.""  Think of the last time a random parent you know just got upset about some service available to his or her child.  Did it immediately become news?  Most likely she is more significant than the story is letting on, she has some sort of influence that is not being disclosed.

3) So a liberal media outlet is going out of its way to make someone who likely has political connections seem more like a regular person.  She is probably perceived by the CBC as a political ally.  This means she is likely a pretty liberal person, and there almost certainly identifies with some form of feminism.

And now let's do some research.  A quick google of ""British Columbia Fiona Brinkman"" turns up a bunch of articles about [this woman](http://www.brinkman.mbb.sfu.ca/fbrinkman/)

Well shit, this isn't just some mom, she's a major public figure in medical science and public health.  Now maybe there's two Fiona Brinkmans and this is just a coincidence but I suspect that that's not the case.  Do you know any women in science?  Especially in administration?  They are all feminists.  Maybe not radical gender-is-a-social-construction feminists.  But definitely Hillary Clinton lean-in style feminists.

This is normal for activism and activist-friendly press.  Did you know that Rosa Parks wasn't just some tired lady.  She was a civil rights activist with more than a decade of organizing experience prior to the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  But the movement portrayed her as a tired everywoman, because that made for better press than portraying her as an agitator.

Page 2.

Do you ever read the Journal of Higher Education?  There's an article about better serving young men in seemingly every issue.

Where do you stand on the parallel issue that college degrees, especially in the humanities, are increasingly money-losers from a lifetime earnings standpoint.  There's a good chance that men are making a correct decision in choosing to spend less time and energy pursuing school, if they do not perceive themselves to be good fits in academic programs with strong career outcomes.  A woman making straight As in an Anthropology major might be being done more harm by the system than the boy who elected not to attend college and instead start working full-time at age 19."
5627,"OK, but the first article was specifically about suicide prevention, and the second article was about economic relief in 2009.  Neither article did a very strong job of directly addressing their specific thesis, the second was considerably better.

As to the significant performance difference between men and women academically, it is certainly real, but I think it's a really complicated issue that cannot be attributed to a single set of causes.

First off, if you look at the gender gap, there is a significant class and income skew to the issue.  At Havard, the student body is about 52-48 male / female, and the graduation rate is pretty close to equal for the genders.  Among the youth of America's ruling class and the very best and brightest of everyone else, gender equality is pretty close.

As you move down the income bracket, women have higher overall academic achievement than men.  When you get to the children of families below the poverty line, the difference is stark.  I think there's a lot of things going on here.

One, the jobs available to men with no higher education are significantly better than the jobs available to women with no higher education.  I live in a nice neighborhood.  The man across the street from me never went to college and runs a plumbing company.  His house is bigger than mine.

Even among business owners, there is a skew where women own more businesses that require extensive credentialing and certification, like real estate agencies and so on, where businesses that simply require one to convince someone to invest in their project, like a car dealership, skew male.

So I think, among the middle class, men often chose to put a low-priority on academics simply because they know a decent number of older men who are financially successful without academic success.  My grandfather was a pretty successful man.  He started and ran a service contractor in the chemical industry.  He never went to college.

So I think a lot of young men are making informed choice, that they have good chances to make good money without spending 4 years in an activity they don't enjoy and accumulating a lot of debt.

Now, traditionally, what have the mom jobs been?  Nursing.  Teaching.  Social Work.  Federal employment.  All things that absolutely require a college degree.  Things that are illegal to do without a college degree.  A young woman in the middle class is likely to look at the successful women around her and see a lot of women with degrees or advanced certifications.  So she's going to consider academic options differently.

Now, shift down to actual communities in poverty.  Single-parent households abound, and usually it's a mother or grandmother raising the kids.  Again the jobs for women here generally require some sort of associates degree or training.  Whereas the jobs for men are more likely to be manual labor or a simple skill like driving a truck.

In low-income communities, you also have to look at the disparity in gender in crime statistics.  Men are more inclined to commit crimes, and more inclined to commit serious, violent crimes, than women.  This removes a lot of young men from the academic track.

That issue is another can of worms.  But if you don't think that there are big, active social organizations specifically focusing on the specific issues of low-income, minority men, you're mistaken.

As for ""everyone who raises these issues is accused of sexism and shut down"" I think you have a narrow view of ""everyone"" because there are tons of people raising the issue of anti-boy culture.  In fact, the idea that society isn't doing a good enough job raising young men to be successful adult men is about 150 years old and dates to industrialization.  I imagine if you ask an average male member of the Republican Party (who are overwhelmingly male, and currently control both houses of congress) ""these days are boys more discriminated against than women?"" most would say yes, and they still have their jobs controlling the most significant branch of government.  In fact, you have cited articles and studies by men's advocacy organizations.  The strangest tactic to me, of men's advocacy is the tendency to assert that the movement doesn't exist at all, when clearly it does.  Yes, you'll be criticized by your opponents, but trust me, anyone on any side of any contentious issue gets criticized.

Anyway, I work within University Administration (albeit in IT, not policy, but I hear discussions) we're taking low male-enrollment seriously.  There's even a very small amount of affirmative action going on where we're admitting young men with slightly worse numbers than young women, and we're putting heavier weight on typically (more) male high school activity, like after-school jobs and participation in sports that does not lead to college-level competition.

The rape thing is a whole 'nother can of worms that I talked very briefly about elsewhere."
5628,"As for the last images, actual policy implementation is very complicated, but I really do think that college students should drink less and be more careful with sex.  For the most part, they haven't been drinking for very long at all.  And for the most part, they haven't been sexually active for very long at all.  I'm 33.  I know which women in my social circle are frequent drinkers and are pretty sex-positive.  And I know who rarely drinks and who has somewhat more reserved attitudes about sex.  I haven't blacked out in over a decade.  If I go out drinking and go home with a woman, I'm pretty good at evaluating the situation (although I have definitely stopped before going through with things when someone turned out to be more drunk than I suspected, this has happened more than once).

20 year olds don't have that kind of experience.  The first time you have sex with someone, you should be sober.  Establish a sexual relationship before you start bringing severely impaired judgement into the mix.

In those final two pieces, I think the first one is presented poorly, but I largely agree with the second one.

Also: if your entire view of feminism is shaped by college students and campus politics, well, I'd say wait a few years and get a larger perspective.  Adult life is different.  I wouldn't go with the definition of any -ism that exists in 20 year olds' heads.

But really, it is not very hard to avoid being accused of rape.  You simply have to be willing to not have sex when things aren't 100% on-board.  You can't be looking at an intoxicated girl and think ""finally, now's my chance."""
5629,That's a very literal interpretation. But the message it's trying to convey is that men's issues and women's issues are two sides of the same coin.
5630,"No you see, MRA's and egalitarian think this is a battle of sexes. Feminists focus on equality for all. Feminist women tend to prioritize women's issues, feminist men tend to prioritize men's issues.

Being egalitarian, from a feminist perspective, is a way to hide actual problems. It's a way to refuse to talk about and fight against negative aspects of masculinity and femininity and gender specific problems, because that's seen as unfairly attacking men and women, mean and pointless. The fact is we need to be able to address uncomfortable questions about genders if we want equality, and today feminists are doing just that while egalitarian are trying to be nice to everyone and refuse to confront problems."

By the way here's what Livestrong says about it being transmitted: How HPV Is Transmitted
HPV makes its home within the layers of the skin, where it expresses its presence by altering the normal behavior of the skin cells. The presence of HPV can usually go unnoticed until the clinical manifestations of warts or cancerous change. Thus, it can be transferred from apparently normal skin during sexual intercourse. Friction and old wounds, such as from previous sexually transmitted diseases, encourage this transfer. The fact that it is transferred from skin to skin means that there is very limited protection offered by latex condoms, since this covers only a little surface area of contact.
Once in contact with skin, HPV makes its way to the basal layers, where cell division takes place to replenish the layers of skin cells. This is where it resides, sometimes for years, before clinical manifestation or being cleared by the body's defense mechanisms."
5683,"yes it does.

5716,"> In fact, doesn't leaving half the population unvaccinated undermine much of the point of vaccination in the first place?

Kinda sorta, but not really as much as you think. There's a ted talk by an epidemiologist that covers pretty much eactly this. The cost benefit works out a lot better than would first appear.

https://www.ted.com/talks/nicholas_christakis_how_social_networks_predict_epidemics

to elaborate, it is easy enough to misunderstand the nature of herd immunity in the context of this vaccination strategy. to break things down there are three orientations a person can have, gay, bisexual, and straight, and (to keep things simple) two genders. this gives us 5 sexual subsets of the population. gay and bisexual males have (relatively) low cost should they contract HPV. lesbian and bisexual women are, as a herd, pretty much immune. this leaves us with only heterosexual people in hetero relationships that can potentially have a high cost.

STD's don't spread through a population like airborne flu. the fundamental unit of the spread of airborne flu through a population is a single individual. the fundamental unit of the spread of STD's through a population is a single sexual encounter/relationship. since hetero relationships are the only ones left to consider, and since one side of the relationship is immune to HPV, there is little to no chance of HPV spreading through the population.

or something like that."
5717,"DING DING DING! We *have* a winner, folks!

Yeah, there's no herd immunity happening here, and with literally hundreds of strains of HPV, they're shooting themselves in the foot."
5718,"This is exactly why California, home of the anti-vaccine crowd, is now seeing a resurgence of mutated strains of human enterovirii (the family polio is in) some of which are now affecting already vaccinated children.


Worse yet, is that polio causes life long paralysis and in some cases life with constant oxygen supply / supported breathing.  This is what used to land people in iron lungs...."
5719,It probably comes down to economics. Contagious diseases that spread easily benefit the most from herd immunity. Most sexual activity happens between men and women. If you vaccinate half the equation in that transmission you've got a long way to reducing potential cases for only half the cost. I don't know the exact numbers but we might be talking about 90% reduction of HPV for 50% of the cost.
5720,you need a solid 80% of a population to be vaccinated to get herd immunity.... which inadvertently protects the ones who decide not to vaccinate.

Yes, but the risk to men is for anal cancer, so it's probably not going to be a woman who gives them hpv in the bottom. To be clear, though, I think both boys and girls should get vaccinated and for free rather than just boys who declare themselves gay. The vaccine also prevents several strains of genital warts (and girls could definitely give those to guys)."
5725,"I think the point was that in this very specific context (an STD), It's not as necessary to vaccinate as many as possible because the vast majority of the vulnerable population (heterosexual women) can get the vaccine for free. And if they have been vaccinated, then guy's won't be able to transfer it to them, and they won't have it to transfer to other guys, which reduces the transference rate dramatically.

But it does come off sounding a little dismissive toward the harm the virus can do to men.

Because the marginal cost of a HPV vaccine is extremely low, doubling the amount of people who get it would mean the pharmacy companies could drop the price in half and still reap nearly the same ROI. Of course the pharma companies will try to exploit a doubling in sales volume, but they would not be capable of keeping the price at it's current level."

--------------------

>  In contrast, if the HIV vaccine proves successful, low or no cost distribution programs will almost certainly be targeted toward gay men, do you consider that to be ""sexist"" too?

I don't think you understand the difference in the two types of infections, nor how the *distribution* of their *rate of infection* relates to the needs of vaccinating both individuals and the species. The dormant infection in a man with HPV can mutate, and then be able to infect previously vaccinated individuals, because they're vaccinated against a different virus. The *rate of infection* is equal between men and women for HPV, while the rate of infection is predominantly amongst Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). **They are quite specifically *refusing* to aid MSM in choosing to help only women, which as I said, is the -real- issue of homophobia.** The fact that it's sexist is secondary, but true by definition.

Just because more women develop cancers by having more options of contracting a specific set of over 100 (200 now?) strains of HPV than men do, we have *that many strains* running around, sometimes mutating to become one more of those many strains (basic evolution). Mutation *always* occurs, the question is then what selection pressures and random events that strain encounters (maybe the guy becomes a monk and doesn't pass it on). As long as half the population isn't vaccinated, you'll *never* be anything resembling safe, especially in the long term from new strains.

**TL;DR - It's exactly *not* sexist to give out assistance *based on rates of distribution*. This isn't about how many people develop *cancer*, this is about how many people get *infected* in the first place.**"

Public health care funding is a finite resource and if that were the only benefit of the HPV vaccine, that money could be spent elsewhere and do far more good, for far more people. 

Edit: We also quantify the value of a decreased life span, so no, it's not ""infinite"". "

5739,"I disagree. Vaccines for diseases that are not spread by casual contact between children should not be mandatory to attend school.

Hepatitis can be transmitted through feces and young school aged children very often have less than perfect bathroom hygiene. Hepatitis can also be spread through exposure to blood, which can accidentally happen in a school environment. Therefore, I am ok with the Hepatitis B vaccine being mandatory. 

You need a very, very good reason to exclude a child from public education. Not participating in a vaccine program that reduces lifetime cancer risk is not a valid reason, IMO. If a child's presence in the classroom poses a risk to others, by all means exclude them. 

To be clear, I do not oppose the HPV vaccine. I do not slut shame. And I certainly don't want anyone to get HPV or cancer."

5742,"I think this is largely irrelevant.

A child with HPV does not pose a threat to their classmates by simply attending class. Therefore, it is not the school or the state's place to mandate HPV vaccination.

In contrast, a child with Measles does pose a threat to their classmates by simply attending class. This makes it the school and the state's place to mandate the Measles vaccine.

To be clear, I am very pro-vaccine. I have every intention of vaccinating my son against HPV. I think that everyone should be vaccinated against HPV. But I simply don't see how anyone has the standing to mandate the HPV vaccine for school children based on how HPV is transmitted."

5772,"We've got to get them vaccinated very young, as it's useless to give it to them after they contract HPV. This makes it very difficult to decide which boys to target.

Do we ask prepubescent boys if they're gay or bisexual? If we do, how many prepubescent year old boys will actually know for sure by then, and how many would be willing to admit to it? How would we manage parental reaction, knowing that they may just flat out decide not to let the child be vaccinated because 'you're not gay'? How would we manage a social perception that a boy with a vaccination plaster may be gay, and how would that affect vaccination uptake?"

The problem you're talking about is antibacterials being over prescribed. This is an issue, as we have TONS of good bacteria on and in us. If we get too gung-ho about killing the baddies that aren't all that bad, we end up doing more harm than good, killing the bacteria that help us (aid in digestion, like you said). The big thing right now is probiotics, prescribing good bacteria to outcompete the bad bacteria in you for resources. Much preferable to an antibiotic nuke. But a broad-spectrum vaccine for more strains will only help (although like others have said, only a few HPV strains are the most virulent or harmful, the rest are non-important).

5846,"> But both are an extremely small problem compared to cervical cancer.

From the stats I have seen you are completely wrong here.

Cancer.org lists lists the cases of HPV related cervical cancer per year at 12,900.

The CDC lists the cases of HPV related throat cancer as 9,356 in men and 2,370 in women for a total of 11,726.

I agree that penile cancer rates are low at only 1000 cases per year.

> I 100% stand behind vaccinating women and not men.

I cant imagine why and I strongly disagree with you. Over 10,000 men will be diagnosed with HPV related cancer this year and that is a serious issue for both their health and the health of their sexual partners. While overall risk is somewhat higher with about 15,000 women being diagnosed with HPV related cancers the numbers are far more close than your claim of ""But both are an extremely small problem compared to cervical cancer"" would have us believe.

It is also important to keep in mind most all of those women were infected from an vaccinated man originally.  Vaccinating men wont only improve their health, it will improve the heath of their female partners.

5847,"> As a male health care provider, I 100% stand behind vaccinating women and not men.

This makes you a retard, for the record. Where do you think women get HPV from? Other women, or men?"
5848,Cost per unit heheh...
5849,"Cervical Cancer is a relatively small problem too though. The rates of HPV caused cancer in the United States is ~20,000/yr for women, ~12,000/yr for men, yet every person seems to be saying that women are SIGNIFICANTLY more likely to get cancer from HPV and that cancer from HPV in men is extremely uncommon. That is just straight horse shit and if people took two seconds to go look at the numbers they would see that."
5850,"So if cervical cancer rates dropped by half, you would no longer support the HPV vaccine for women?"
5851,"Homosexual men are at a very similar risk level as heterosexual women, though. Anal cancers occur at about 60% the rate of cervical cancers (~7,000 vs. ~12,000), so lower but still substantial, and more than 90% of those cases are attributed to HPV (as opposed to close to 100% of cervical cancers attributed to HPV).


More to the point, there are more than 40,000 cases of Oropharyngeal cancer (throat cancer) in the US each year, which occur more than twice as often in men as they do in women. Now, only 72% of those are linked to HPV, but that's still about 29,000 cases attributed to HPV. More than 2.5x as many cases as there are cases of cervical cancer. About 1/3 of those cases are women, so only around 19-20 thousand cases attributed to men, but still. Cervical cancers occur at about 60% the rate of throat cancers in men caused by HPV (~12,000 vs. ~20,000).


In the end, the risk for homosexual males is very comparable to the risk for women; perhaps even more so, depending on the circumstances. And considering that maybe only half of all girls in a given area will even get this vaccination, heterosexual men are still at a very substantial risk of contracting it and succumbing to throat cancer, too. I don't see why you think that cervical cancer is the only threat of HPV.

5855,"Go fuck yourself, juilian had no reason to be so condescending if he/she didn't have the knowledge to back it up. I don't care how deadly it is, it is still cancer, and everyone on here is making it sound like men don't have a cancer risk from HPV at all. The rates are 20,000/yr for women and 12,000/yr for men in the United States. That difference is not enough to justify a comment like ""Yea because of all the men getting cervical cancer"" because cervical cancer isn't the only fucking cancer you can get from being infected by HPV."

5862,"While in a few generations that's probably true, if we managed to reduce the total infection rate by large scale vaccination, eventually the vaccine would only need administered for a much smaller at-risk population. I don't know when that would end up being worth it in the long run, however."
5863,"""It happens less often so fuck 'em""

Let's also ignore it would further protect women from contracting HPV as well.

5872,"I hadn't even thought of that. It's also really hard to test a guy for HPV isn't it? We don't know the effects that HPV has on men either. What if later there was a link found to it causing some sort of cancer in men, and simply giving the vaccine to all men would have prevented all men and women from getting it, but giving it only to women protects only women. This seems to be the only disease where there is no attempt made to prevent the spread of it (men spread it from woman to woman) and all the focus is on preventing one particular group from having negative consequences from the disease. All in the name of ""women's health"", when really they are endangering more women. "
5873,"Your argument saying men aren't as aware is even more reason why men should be getting this. Leave it to reddit to try to crucify someone who says men and women should get the vaccine, not just women. Lol. How dare I care about men's health!"

Also herd immunity is better than only having half the population having it. What happens to a women who can't take the vaccine because of allergies or religious beliefs? She is at higher risk because most men won't get the $300 shot because it isn't in their budget to do so."
5879,"And what about women who can't get vaccinated because of medical reasons such as allergies? Wouldn't herd immunity be more better for everyone if men got it free as well?

That's saying only women who aren't allergic can get the shot and all the other women are left to their own devices since men won't spend so much cash of a vaccine if they can't pay for it. It only helps everyone if everyone is vaccinated but only half or even less vaccinated doesn't make much sense.

And you're calling me selfish when I'm thinking of human beings in general when you're thinking about finite money and having only women have the vaccine because throat and anal cancer is only a small problem for men so it isn't in the budget for them. You're the selfish one."

It is an investment for sure, but by taxing gains made by private companies utilizing space, they can recoup costs.

Well designed public transport reduces the wear and tear on the road. It also reduces traffic congestion and decreases car crashes. All of these things save money for the State. It can also allow poorer citizens to have reliable transit to work or stores without having to buy a shitty car on Craigslist. Instead of paying randomly for car repairs, the expense for public transit can be predicted. This helps people become more economically secure.

Some programs are miss managed or are not modernized. A good example of this is farm subsidies. Because the State did not want the cost of food to fluctuate for its citizens, the State agreed to eat part of the cost of food production. The idea was great, but because it became a Republican talking point, it was almost impossible to modernize. Now big companies/farmers can abuse the system to make money by not farming all the land they could have.
Another problem with the farm subsidies program is that some people do use it as intended. Stopping the program would cause economic damage to citizens. Keeping the program causes economic loss for the State. Finding middle ground is a bitch in politics, so nothing ever works quite right."

5901,">That's not really the same. In the case of the virus, you're talking about something that indiscriminately attacks whatever host it is exposed to, but is markedly more fatal in one gender than the other.

Define what you consider markedly. A quick google search reveals that the low end of early catch survival rates for throat cancer is 80%, while cervical is 70%. Low end for late catch is 25 % and 20% respectively when it has spread to other organs. That is not worthy of a 'markedly' in my opinion. HPV was originally approached as a Woman's health issue because of its known association with cervical cancer. How many instances of men contracting penile and throat cancer go unconnected to HPV despite actually being caused by it? We don't know, because we haven't been bothering to check for it among men. 

My comparison isn't the exact same, no. But you were originally stating that HPV is a bigger problem for women than men, hence why it is okay that men have to pay for a vaccine while it is free for women. My comparison is that violence is a bigger issue for men, because it objectively is as men are more likely to face it than women, it must also be okay for men to receive more attention with regards to that. Doing anything else is being inconsistent. 

The people that will never target women out of personal bias are automatically only targeting men, that is no less heinous a choice as the person who only targets women. 

You may have seen men's shelters, I never have, as there was only one in my country that closed because it couldn't apply for federal funding.  Are you talking about shelters for homeless men to sleep in? I was referring to shelters for victims of sexual abuse/violence. In my country, only women are entitled to such services."

5911,It's not insanity because straight men would also be protected if all women were vaccinated. Covering most of the population by subsidizing half is a smart move. If it was half price for everyone it wouldn't be as effective.

It's about the weight of the specific cancer, how curable it is, and the physical repercussions left afterwards. Many women can't birth children after these cancer treatments, but as I outlined in a previous post, throat cancer has a 80-95% cure rate if caught in its early stage."
5917,"That they contract in greater numbers. I don't exactly agree with costs being 0 for women and 300 for men instead of a more spread out number, but I'm also not a professional in the field. I assume they take into account that being able to birth a child carries a monetary weight to it, as well as that being a big part of most women's lives. "
5918,"It really does though. There is no ""Men's Health Clinic"" because most people just call it a clinic. You can get all proper male medical examinations there. In fact, most people do.

5923,Except men get hpv related cancers overall at only half the rate of women. Not all women will be vaccinated and efficacy could easily drop in later years. For decent protection of men it is readily cost effective to give them the vaccine. This can cut throat cancers by 50-70%

It depends what approach they're taking (i.e, why they think contraception should be covered in the first place). The first thing that comes to mind is that women are the ones actually getting pregnant. We might say that it's reasonable that health insurers should provide women the ability not to get pregnant if they don't wish (given that this has health implications), while not necessarily saying that they should provide men the ability not to get other people pregnant (which doesn't have health implications). 

Do I think that it's a bit dumb? Sure, it falls short particularly when it comes to couples. Do I think it's necessarily sexist? I'm not sure.

Also, assuming the canadian case is sexist simply because you feel that your case was is not very rational imo; the Canadian case has more obvious reasons for it than a sexist medical conspiracy (especially given that the people making the legislation etc are mostly men afaik)."
5933,Props to you to taking time to understand my comment and admit that you came around :) 
5934,"*sigh*

I'm not saying there's some crazy conspiracy out there saying ""MEN SHOULD PAY FOR ALL HEALTHCARE"", so please don't try to paint it that way. 

So if you separate out people into ""groups"" men and women, in general women used to have to pay more for medical health insurance (in the United States for example), because you guessed it women use health insurance more. Well they changed this so women no longer have to pay additional for health insurance and instead the same cost must be paid by men and women for the same insurance policy. I would say that is shifting the cost of health insurance from women onto men. "
5935,You're full of shit. There are most definitely policies designed to shift costs from women to men.
5936,"That's correct, it is more expensive for females because they use it much more frequently and more often a higher cost. That has been changed in the United States, and you are not allowed to charge women more then men anymore, they are considered a group ""pool"" now. "
5937,"Not allows, REQUIRES. There's a difference. 

So, let's play this out and you should see the problem with this. We've found the interest in sports to be higher among men then women (see link and many other with a google), so for example you have 50 men and 50 women, and 70% of the men are interest in sports and 50% of the women are interested in sports, where does that leave you? 

What happens to the other 20% of the men who would like to participate in sports? "
5938,"That's EXACTLY my point. They looked at medical cost from a cost benefit analysis and found they SHOULD shift the cost onto men so they are increasing the cost of men, to decrease the cost of women. 

The fact you said ""there's a lot of catching up to do"" only shows exactly what I'm talking about. Where's the catching up on evening out cost of automobile insurance? "

I would agree. I guess you haven't figured it out by now, that I am not assuming most individuals don't care about men.

I think your whole point goes a little overboard, but particularly this sentence struck out to me. You're painting everyone who identifies as ""feminist"" with the same brush. The frothing rabid feminazi bogeymen of your nightmares may not have the same attitude as someone who simply identifies themselves as a feminist because they think women aren't treated equally on a number of issues.

For example, you know how Planned Parenthood is being defunded due to a video filled with false information, even though no federal dollars were spent by Planned Parenthood on abortion? That's a real issue, that women everywhere just had to deal with, and it's happening now. So that provides a little counterpoint to your vague ""any time there's a women's issue everyone goes apeshit"" argument.

There's also quite a few people in there calling out other users for posting in SRS, and at the time I believe it was the top post in SRS and the OP had his comment in the negatives. 

> a great deal depends on the relationship and whether or not the woman did feel violated there

Yep. Which a lot of people, SRS users, completely ignored. They did not care for how the girl felt, all they cared about was that she pushed him away. That's it. That is literally the only ""rapey"" thing described. They were laughing, they were having a good time. In the first place, ""no"" does not always mean no, if you didn't know. So if she did say no, which she didn't, it completely depends on how she said it, and of course how she meant it. 

As for another possible exception? The most obvious one, rape play. Another not-so-obvious one, is simply if the person *does not mean no*. Whether they're verbally saying it, or physically, it all depends on what they mean.

Anyways, back to the point. If you go ahead and assume it was 100% rape due to that one action of pushing away, completely excluding everything else, I'm sure some would call you a SJW. So, hopefully I can stay on topic next time."

6032,"Contraception is not healthcare unless it is being used to treat a medical condition. I'm not saying that the overall cost is lower when you don't cover contraception. I'm saying that it is outside the scope of what government funded healthcare should be covering, regardless of the benefits. I want contraception to be cheap and available. If that means that the government needs to put a price cap on it and force providers to charge less, I am ok with that. If we want the government to pay for contraception, we need to pass that separately instead of making it part of healthcare laws. If our democratically elected government decides to provide contraception at the expense of some members of society who may not want to pay for it, that is fine, but it should be voted on individually. We should not stick it to bills that need to pass as a way of avoiding a real vote on it. 

Healthcare is a basic human necessity and the government needs to make sure that people have it. Contraceptives are not a basic human necessity. If the government will provide contraception, it must be what the country wants the government to do. It cannot be forced through by calling it something that it is not.

Also, your point about the cost is valid but limited. Assuming that those who would receive free contraception are low income earners and that their children will need government support, the cost will be greater if we do not provide contraception. However, you must consider the side effects of a decline to the birth rate. A smaller young population relative to a larger old population which is living longer severely harms programs like Social Security. If your assumption that there will be fewer low-income children with free contraception is true, it will decrease the amount of labor available for necessary yet undesirable jobs. This may have a positive effect by raising wages, or it may have a negative effect by stagnating the economy. You are only accounting for two variables when you say that the bill will be larger without free contraception. While you are probably correct, that is far too limited a calculation. You would need to fully analyze the myriad ways in which it could impact society prior to saying that one is cheaper than the other."
6033,"It does, which is why I think it should be voted on based on that merit. Healthcare is provided because it is a basic necessity. Contraception is not healthcare unless it is being used to treat health problems. The social benefit we get from having fewer unwanted pregnancies is a good thing, but if we want to provide free contraception, we need to pass a law which provides it on the basis of social benefit. When we force it through as part of a healthcare bill, it forces people to pay for a service which while being beneficial, is not inherently the duty of the government to provide. If people are to pay for a societal benefit, they have the right to have their opinion heard via the legislative process, even if their opinion is wrong. As such, it must be passed based on its merit as a social benefit rather than stuck to bills which pay for it on the basis that it is a human necessity."
6034,"See if you can follow the way it works.

6045,so where are all the doctors saying how utterly useless it is to give HPV to strictly girls?
6046,"I mean...not really.  Herd immunity is a different animal when you are talking about STDs.

Let's imagine that all (most) women are given the vaccination.

So, any women--lesbian, straight, or otherwise--are vaccinated, so they're relatively safe.
  
Any straight men (meaning only having sex with women, who are vaccinated) are effectively getting the effect of herd immunity (they only interact with the vaccinated).  

There is a legitimate risk for non-straight men in this scenario--the argument is that while there are risks for men who get HPV, it is nowhere near the concern that it is for women.

So, would giving the medicine to everyone have an effect?  For a relatively small portion of the population, yes--but the question is is it worth it from a cost-benefit analysis standpoint.  Also, if the only 'at-risk' group is non-straight men, we enter into a very awkward scenario--do we only grant the vaccine to that group of men?  Giving a vaccine to only gay people would be a PR nightmare at best."

6057,"Right, but that's the real cost, right now. When you're talking about current public policy, that's what you look at. It's a no brainer to subsidize polio and MMR vaccines because the cost-utility ratio is very high.  That's not as clear with the HPV vaccine.

The reason it's a hyperbole is because you said ""they refuse to help homosexuals"". They don't refuse, just the current model intrinsically helps girls and heterosexual males. If a male says, ""I need this shot to get"" They're not going to say ""are you a homo? Because I'm not giving you this shot."" That's where it's a hyperbole. There's no refusing. 

On top of it, the gross oversimplification is about resources. This is an insanely effective way, to protect the most of the population the easiest. Let's look at two models. 

First, let's look at what they're doing, on a sample of 100 people. Estimates on the percentage of people who self identify as gay or lesbian varies greatly, and I've never seen a solid estimate about 7% (and that's incredibly aggressive). So if 50 girls get it, we have 93 people who are protected.

The other model we can look at is if they cut the cost in half, but charge everyone. So now, that same 50 vaccinations, protects... 50 people. And we're left with 50 people at risk. 

In a perfect world, we could give everyone the vaccinations for free, but there aren't the resources to sustain that. For the resources that are available, this is an amazing way to protect as much of the population as possible.

I'm not saying this model doesn't have it's draw backs, but it's easy to attack it without realizing how much good it does. "
6064,"Sexist generally has a negative connotation that implies *unfair* discrimination. We're not giving the vaccine to women because we like women better, we're giving it to women because the numbers currently support the idea that giving it to women does the most good (in terms of cost savings and disease prevention). We also give it to teenage women rather than adult women, are you going to argue that it's ageist too? 

Edit: To clarify, I support (amd always have supported) giving the vaccine to both genders, which is policy in the US. The initial policy of giving it to young females only was based on the cost utility numbers, not on an indiscriminate belief that women ""deserve"" it,  which would absolutely be sexist. "
6065,"I very much understand how viruses work, thank you. HPV already has many identifiable strains, only a few of which are known to increase the risk for cervical cancer. Guardasil was developed because cervical cancer used to be one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths on women before pap smears became common and currently,  screening and testing and treatment of precancerous cells is crazy exspensive , costing $6bn of the $8bn healthcare dollars a year that we spend on HPV related issues. From a public health related perspective, that's an area that has a HUGE potential for cost reduction. If public health programs had unlimited funds, then sure, let's vaccinate everyone (which, by the way, we actually require private health insurance to do now) because like you said, that would be the absolute best way to go about it.  Unfortunately, funds are limited, so public health professionals have to make decisions, and the studies initially showed that best value for the dollar was to target a certain demographic, girls of a certain age. You're taking that decision and reading a whole bunch of other stuff into it and honestly, I'm not sure why. I've run public health programs and sometimes hard decisions have to be made but they're ALWAYS based on numbers, not some cabal of people deciding that homosexual men are less deserving.

 Anecdotally, most of the public health people I know are some of the most liberal people I know and are extremely sensitive to any perceived discrimination of vulnerable populations. It's pretty shitty to accuse them of having malevolent intentions without having a lick of proof. It sucks to have make decisions about who gets care and who doesn't, and I guarantee you, the vast majority of public health policy is written with the intention of an efficent allocation of resources and doing the most good with the limited resources we're given.  "
6066,">I mean, as individuals, yes this is what we're interested in but from the perspective of people writing public health policy, no it wouldn't make sense to use a $300 vaccine on 10 million additional people a year to prevent a disease that costs a couple million to treat and only affects 700 people. Public health care funding is a finite resource and if that were the only benefit of the HPV vaccine, that money could be spent elsewhere and do far more good, for far more people. 

I mean, this isn't a $1000/pill medicine. Its a total of 3 shots.

6108,">Because a disease always starts from a single infection point in a social group, not from a proportional number of people at the same time. 

Usually this is not the case. The first time it is, but after that it behaves differently.

While you could trace it back to a ""first"" case if you look back far enough, most of the time you're not dealing with a single pinpoint. The way you're describing it is only useful when studying the spread from patient zero. 

Once the cat is out of the bag and you have multiple infected people that exist in the world it becomes a probability game.

For instance, let's say that AIDS was already a problem in San Francisco but didn't yet exist in Philadelphia. When the problem begins in Philadelphia it's going to start from various people who have come into contact with infected people from San Francisco. It's not going follow a spread like you'd see if you were studying patient zero. So in a large city like Philadelphia the problem would begin spreading from multiple points. And if you were to calculate risk during that time period then homosexual sex and sharing needles with people from San Francisco would be a risk factor. 

It's similar to the way they handle Ebola now. While there was a patient zero at one time, that time has since past. Now it's a probability game and the main risk factors are travel to countries like Congo, Ivory Coast, or medical professionals who have come into contact with patients being treated for Ebola. The risk is applied at the individual level.

In other words you're treating the spread as a patient zero investigation, but I'm treating it as epidemiology which assumes that multiple cases already exist.

6132,"Based on a CBA (which are routinely done) the QOLY cost for vaccinating males is something insanely high (even when accounting for female infections).

Also there's recent evidence showing that while vaccination doesn't cure/treat current infections, it might help prevent reinfection and even prevent the progression of CINI to CINII/CINIII, although it's still pretty recent. A little bit of HPV isn't going to kill anyone, until they're like 40+ anyway.

I still think it's prudent to vaccinate everyone (and I paid out of pocket to get the full round of gardasil 4, and now have paid for 1 dose of gardasil 9 so far), but there's plenty of other things that need to be done too that would be cheaper/more effective for benefiting the health of people. Things like everyone getting the flu shot every year, which not enough people get. Hell, even vaccinating homeless populations, senior home residents, and healthcare workers against BCG (conferring some protectiong against TB) might be a good idea, or plenty of other things, before considering vaccinating twelve year olds boys against HPV. Focusing more money towards vaccinating twelve year old girls and actually making it mandatory to attend school or something like that would be a prudent decision, too.

You're not wrong, but I don't think it's what you're portraying it as.  It's not ""favoring women.""  It's a medical fact, HPV affects women *more* than men.  That's not saying men are unaffected.  The people making the decisions have decided they only have so much money, and they've chosen to direct it at protecting those most at risk.

Is this the right choice?  I'm honestly not sure.  I'm not an expert.  But do I see what they're trying to do?  Yes, I do.  That's not the same as saying it's the right decision.

CINs dwarf the number of actual invasive cervical cancers, and the majority of CINs do still require some form of treatment which can carry significant morbidity and costs. There isn't any such equivalent for the male HPV-related cancers you mention."

If women weren't vaccinated you'd see much higher rates.

"
6169,"Having a quick look at the figure you gave for cervical cancer diagnosis, I wouldn't take it at face valve. Firstly because it is an estimate for 2015. Secondly, the vaccine was introduced 7-8 years ago, so the 12 thousand figure you gave is likely reduced from what the unvaccinated number would be."

The rates of HPV caused cancer in the United States is ~20,000/yr for women, ~12,000/yr for men, yet every person seems to be saying that women are SIGNIFICANTLY more likely to get cancer from HPV and that cancer from HPV in men is extremely uncommon.

Many more women in the US are vaccinated against HPV than men are, and yet women still have higher rates of HPV-caused cancer. That seems counter to your argument. "

6190,This question is beyond the ambit of a glib Reddit discussion. And you well know it.
6191,"All public health decisions come with an evaluation of costs and benefits.  Costs include both money, as well as potential injuries and complications from the treatment.  Benefits are the dollar savings from reduced treatment as well as the well-being of patients who don't have to suffer through an illness.

A good example of this is the change in advice about when to get mammograms a few years ago.  Several studies showed that the cost for younger women to get mammograms and the negative effects of treatment for false positives outweighed the low number of cancers that were caught.  There was a lot of pushback but there are academically accepted techniques for analyzing the ""costs"" of invasive medical treatment and even deaths.

So for the HPV vaccine...male cancers are more rare, and men get most of the benefit of the vaccine if women get vaccinated.  So based on the current cost they feel it isn't worth the expense for men to get it as well.  Remember that the benefit of men getting the vaccine would have to be greater than any other use of that same amount of money for public health.

Lets say you have females getting cancer A from HPV and males getting cancer B from HPV. For the sake of the argument cancer A and B are mutually exclusive. Having HPV results in a 5% chance for girls to get cancer A and a .5% chance of boys getting cancer B. Treatment for cancer A cost 10,000 rupees and treatment for cancer B cost 5,000 rupees. Economically it would make more sense to favor treating cancer A. Morally it is a completely different question. "

6196,"You have the order reversed. Protecting people from cancer needs to prove why it supersedes economic viability. 

We can reduce cancer risks dramatically by distorting markets with known carcinogens and passing on the cost to either consumers or the public.

>Due to the fact that men don't often get cervical cancer men will be less likely to get this vaccination. A free vaccine for men will reach a smaller part of the population and is therefore far less effective.

There are only limited funds for healthcare, decisions need to be made that provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people. Men are the recipients of the same advantages for other causes, this isn't a gender issue."
6213,"Climb down off your cross, buckaroo. I wasn't crucifying anyone.
  
I fully agree that men should get this vaccine. I was merely stating that the general public isn't aware that men also need this vaccine, as well as the benefit to women if men get this vaccine, therefore they're less likely to vaccinate their sons than they are to vaccinate their daughters.  

It wasn't an argument in favor of not vaccinating men. It was an explanation for WHY the focus is currently on women - they are at greater immediate risk AND are more likely to be proactive about getting the vaccine. Greater efforts to educate and vaccinate men are necessary and definitely the next step in HPV eradication.

In the meantime, the limited funds for free vaccines are concentrated on supplying them to the part of the population that is the most likely to get vaccinated. "
6214,"Well, I know with HIV it's less likely for women to get it from other women. I was just assuming. It's because with male to female penetration there is a lot more fluid exchange. Plus the skin is slightly lacerated by the friction of the act. So, blood, in undetectable to the eye levels is exchanged between partners.

I didn't know how HPV spread to be honest. I was just going by what others said. Still, if it's not spread often by kissing, then it's not likely spread *easily* by lesbian interactions. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, it is just less likely."

Hell, one of these shots is likely more expensive than the petition fees."
6217,"Okay, but we live in real life. There is only so much money right now to vaccinate. They're doing what has the highest impact - vaccinating women. Or are you so ignorant that you can't understand what a *budget* is?"
6218,"I never said the minority shouldn't be protected, note that personally I think everyone should be covered. What I'm saying is that if one is strictly going off the numbers (which is what most of public health resource allocation is about), the cost/benefit (benefit being in dollar amounts) ratio of giving women the vaccine is higher.  That doesn't mean that the benefit to giving men the vaccine is zero, or that they are ""undeserving"", it just means that of they have limited resources, they're going to go for the scenario that gives the most bang for the buck. Those vaccines are, as noted in the article, expensive. 

In the example you gave (STD programs targeting young black women) the *incidence* of STDs was disproportionately high, which means that dollar for dollar, programs that target that demographic are going to see a greater benefit. That's all most of  resource allocation comes down to, cost vs benefit. Now again, there are times when, in the name of fairness, we can choose to expand programs at the expense of efficency, and there's a great argument that this is one of those scenarios but the choice to not give the vaccine to men in the first place wasn't personal.

As for the price in EUropean countries, I don't know, I just know I got all my medical care without paying much out of pocket. Of course tax systems cover a lot of it over here, and it works.

It makes sense for a country to give it's people medicine, particularly preventative medicine like vaccines, birth control, health education, things like that. It's a sound investment in the workforce and if you want your country to be as strong as possible, it makes sense.

There are some problems though, of course. Like my grandmother was basically killed last week by neglect at a care facility. She was always complaining about aches and pains and trying to get painkillers and stuff, as she had MS that had progressed pretty far. The night in question she called for help 8 times, and while they did show up, they didn't seem to take her complaints seriously. They did log her complaining repeatedly of chest pains and pain in her left arm, and in the morning they found her dead from a heart attack, which likely could have been prevented if they had taken the complaint seriously, but personally I'm kind of relieved that she kicked the bucket, because she's been suffering for decades, and would have had little more than suffering ahead of her for who knows how long. She appears to have died fairly suddenly and peacefully in her sleep.

But that facility she was on was a disgrace in more ways than that, but I won't go into all of it.

Definitely there are some problems to take care of, like waiting lists and whatnot, but that's more due to a lack of doctors than to do with the public funding of the field."

Uhhh...no sorry.  The NHS is WAY more far reaching than this issue.  Sure, this issue is covered under it.  But making the claim that the NHS was ""set up specifically for things like this"" is simply incorrect.  The NHS provides statistical data on population, resources, economy, society, and culture.  All of which are much broader subjects than the HPV vaccinations.

> You're ignoring these arguments because they aren't what you want to hear. Don't deny it, I can literally see it.

Making a lot of bold claims...and very little facts to back them up.  When you feel like coming back with examples that back you up, I'll be happy to entertain them."
6233,"> Still it looks like they're targeting gay males on the assumption that straight males are safe, because 50% of females are vaccinated.

I'd imagine it's related to the riskier sexual practices of homosexual men, as well. A straight male is less likely to contract HPV from his female partner through oral and anal sex, even without taking vaccination with Gardasil into account. Additionally, although condoms aren't very effective at preventing the transmission of HPV, they nevertheless still provide some protection, and heterosexual partners have more incentive to use them due to the added risk of unplanned pregnancies resulting from unprotected sex with one another.

Honestly, I think it's only a matter of time before the vaccine is offered to anyone and everyone. The cost of each dose of the vaccine will eventually fall, making universal vaccination a lot more feasible for the government to be able to offer. The rise of HPV related cancers which aren't cervical cancer will place huge financial strains on the healthcare budgets sooner or later. Eradicating as many of the known cancer-causing strains of HPV through widespread vaccination programs is an extremely worthwhile goal for any government to pursue, but these things take time and money. 

It's unfortunate, but necessary for the relevant health authorities to 'triage' access to this vaccine until its more cost effective for them to offer it more broadly. Whether the triage process in the case of Gardasil is currently ideal is a question that would require extensive cost-benefit analyses, and epidemiological studies. Even if the general public had access to the materials the government referenced to formulate their policies, very few people would have the knowledge base and requisite levels of insight to critically evaluate the decision making process, and make a reasonable judgment either way.

Women's sexual health is a political hot button issue at the best of times, and the sexual health and general well-being of gay men doesn't usually fare much better. In this instance, it's clear to me that schemes to enhance both the former and the latter, are universally beneficial, even to those not directly targeted by the current restrictive policies on funding for free vaccination with Gardasil. Straight men are not exactly 'losers' here, either. When it comes to safe, effective vaccination, the more the merrier, I reckon. Stamp that shit out. Warts are gross."
6234,"> A quick google search reveals that the low end of early catch survival rates for throat cancer is 80%, while cervical is 70%.

But how many instances of throat cancer come up from HPV, as opposed to cervical cancer?  I've seen numbers that say it's much more prevalent.  So sure, if you get throat cancer from it, you're not in good shape.  But you're more LIKELY to get the cervical cancer (if you're a woman) and more likely to die from it than the throat cancer.  At least, that's what I've read says.

> But you were originally stating that HPV is a bigger problem for women than men

Correct.

> hence why it is okay that men have to pay for a vaccine while it is free for women.

Incorrect.  I never said it was ""okay.""  I said it was understandable.  I also said (repeatedly today in many replies) that it might not be the right choice.

> Doing anything else is being inconsistent.

But we don't live in a world where we react to everything exactly the same (thankfully).  We evaluate each scenario based upon the complexities that form it, and react accordingly.

> Are you talking about shelters for homeless men to sleep in?

Yes, it wasn't clear what you were referring to.  But you've explained that.  

I think the thing is, it's not a case that women are ""entitled"" to these shelters.  It's that there is a *need* for them.  That's been proven.  I'm not here to tell you there isn't a need for men's shelters; that's way off topic, and I'm not going to be drawn into that debate.  But the shelters we do have are there because they fill a need.  If the need was great enough for a men's shelter, they would be there as well.  It's not some grand conspiracy against men.

At the end of this...I'm not really sure what your point is.  You seem to be saying that we should react to everything the same; that's not the way the world works.

It's medically proven that HPV is more deadly to women than men.  That's a simple fact.  Thus, I can see why they give the vaccine to women for free; to stop deaths.  Is that the right choice?  Maybe not.  Maybe, as someone else suggested, we should charge women $50, and men $200.  Maybe we should find a way to reallocate the funding and make it free for everyone.

But I understand *why* they chose to make it free.  Not to discriminate against men.  Not for some agenda.  It's simply to save lives.

And that ain't bad."
6235,"> Far better that those who can afford it pay for it, instead of discriminating against a group of people because of their gender or ethnicity.

But that's not the way Canadian healthcare works.  The entire system is based off the idea that everyone pays into it (if you're working at least) and then when you need it, you get care.

There's no ""afford to pay for it.""  I understand if you're from another country, and that's the way it's done there, and maybe you think that's right.  But it's not the way it's done in my country, and I think we are doing things correctly.

Besides, this whole thing is a limited time trial anyways.  Soon enough women will have to pay for the vaccine the same as men.  They're just giving it out for free to the most at-risk group for a short time to prevent some fatalities.  It's not to create herd immunity or anything; just to protect some folks."

6237,"I believe you're being deliberately naive.

Yes, funds could be allocated in such a way that all vaccinations are covered. Unfortunately, this would result in a diversion of funds from other important medical expenditures such as prenatal visits or emergency care.

Here in BC (the province the article is written about) we have a publicly funded health system. In order to have this system, and to keep it running year-to-year, money has to be carefully budgeted to ensure doctors and nurses are paid, and all other costs are covered.

When we go to the doctor or are admitted to hospital we don't pay out of pocket. This means that the health system knows in advance how much money it has for a given year.

Would you really prioritize equity in vaccinations over other health measures which are dollar-for-dollar more essential for the health of Canadians? 

Idealism has its place, but that place is not in determining a Health care budget. "

I didn't say it happened in this thread. Reddit is one of the few places where sexism against men is actually pointed out on a regular basis and taken seriously.

>Also, the idea of ""women and children first"" pre-dates modern feminism - not sure if this agrees or disagrees with your comment; it's kind of a run-on sentence.

There are a metric shit-ton of disadvantages to the male gender role (and advantages to the female gender role) other than disaster situations, although that rule does fit into the wider dynamic of male disposability (where women's lives are considered more valuable than men's) which you still routinely see in media reports, but which can also be seen on a lower and much more everyday life level with the expectation that men absorb risk on behalf of women (including putting women's safety, comfort and basic physical wellbeing above their own) aswell as a female entitlement to a superior standard of empathy/victimhood. All of this tying into the idea that women have ""inherant"" social value (which does not need to be proven) which men do not (their social value being based on precisely what they can prove) - which also very much ties into ""man up"" norms."

The frothing rabid feminazi of my nightmares are the Jackies and Emmas that can control the narrative with lies. They are the ""videogames are sexist"" and ""listen and believe"" boogeymen that happen to be some of the most prominent names in the movement. The nightmare is a movement that does not eliminate inequality, but shifts it to a different group and uses misinformation to solidify it. One in five? Seventy cents on the dollar? All cooked stats, but all used to support giving men the short end of the stick that women have complained about for ages. Don't get me wrong, women got shafted in the past, but that does NOT mean its okay to simply shaft the men because of some nebulous cabal of males or becaue men are somehow magically immune from discrimination and suppresion.

>For example, you know how Planned Parenthood is being defunded due to a video filled with false information, even though no federal dollars were spent by Planned Parenthood on abortion? That's a real issue, that women everywhere just had to deal with, and it's happening now. So that provides a little counterpoint to your vague ""any time there's a women's issue everyone goes apeshit"" argument.

Trying to defund and actually defunding are two different things. The members of congress know that is a losing battle. Not to mention there is mass support from both genders in support of PP. 'I stand with Planned Parenthood' if you must know. I shut down the arguments I encounter, addressing the blatant lies.

6270,"Sure!  So I don't know Chicago at all, forgive me, but I know in my neck of the woods we are gearing up for the annual Slut Walk.  This is basically a parade where people wear as much or as little as they feel like to draw attention to body shaming, slut shaming and the more pressing problem of people being attacked for what they're wearing.  Kind of a ""It's my body, I'll wear what I want"" sort of thing.

We had a rally not long ago for the ""Free the Nipple"" campaign.  It kind of got taken over at the last moment by a bunch of Black Lives Matter dudes, but the basic idea was that it's stupid af that men are allowed to be topless wherever they want, but women can't.  Most of my friends went because they wanted to highlight the issue of women breastfeeding in public being taboo... like you can have all these lingerie ads all over, but if someone uses a boob for its biological purpose, it's suddenly wrong?

Target (based out of my city, so it's been at the forefront of our minds here) removed gender-specific labels on toys and bedding.  This is good for kids who want an action figure but might be turned off that it says it's ""for boys"" or ""for girls"".  In reality.. if a kid wants a toy, who cares what gender you think it should go to?  They're kids.

There are also big events around here for middle school/high school girls to get them interested in STEM.  Boys can attend.  When I went as a kid, there were a couple dudes from my class who went as well.  But the purpose is to get more women interested in traditionally male fields.  Actually, according to my buddy who is now working with that program, it's run by the Women in Engineering group but it's no longer marketed to just women because they're finding that the gender gap is closing.  So that's awesome!

If you want to find events, you REALLY need to keep your eyes open.  Google ""Gender issues in Chicago"" or ""Chicago based feminism events"".  Something like that.  If you read a blog and you think it's idiotic (trust me, I come across plenty of over-the-top extreme feminist stuff) then ignore it.  Don't post, don't add to their comment or click counter.  Just ignore it and find something that more fits your ideals.  I like the Skepchick website because the run the gamut from over-the-top to fairly reasonable, so it's easy to find the bloggers and issues that relate to me and then explore more of what that particular person does.  Plus, one of my good friends writes for them and introduced me to the more reasonable writers on that site and got me hooked.

Those are the two most major feminist issues in the political debate these days, so I'm not sure what more you want.

My reference to my facebook feed was to individual women and men that I know, not to organizations.  I've been hearing about the HPV vaccines for probably about 10 years.  It has very much been a feminist cause.  Feminist health groups were pushing to get the HPV vaccine covered by Obamacare back in 2009, and they succeeded.

I'm of the age where a lot of my peer group are parents of elementary school aged children.  I see a lot of posts of parents advocating for other parents to get their kids, male and female, the full HPV vaccine suite.

As to American organizations advocating on this issue, again, it's different in America.  HPV vaccination already is free for children with Obamacare and Medicaid here, so the issue that is being raised by this article doesn't apply.  The issue holding back HPV vaccination rates in America is participation.  The people in my life making the most noise trying to get other people to participate in HPV vaccination are feminists."
6279,Yes it is. I know first hand by observing different ways men I know were raised. Men who were taught that it's ok to be emotional are and men who were taught it's not ok aren't. It's not biology it's psychology. Though biology does play a small part.
6280,"Again, from a feminist perspective, an egalitarian saying ""keeping the pendulum of power/privilege in the middle"" means keeping things more or less the same with only marginal changes, means status quo, means patriarchy and institutionalized sexism.

I'm not saying egalitarians view gender issues as a battle of sexes, I'm saying they think feminists view it like that. Which we don't.

See one of the reasons feminists tend to group up egalitarians and MRA's in the same bag is because of the kind of thing you say. 

> there are many differences between the genders besides our genitals

Genitals don't make the gender. That's dismissing the entire trans population. How you identify yourself makes the gender.

And feminists do agree that there are differences between genders. Differences in the range and distribution of physical attributes. Differences in how illness targets us. Even differences in how we tend to react to hormones, again with a wide range and distribution for all genders.

The thing is that we believe we are mentally similar, and that the more we are removed from gender roles and gendered education the more it shows, while MRA's and egalitarian tend to believe that there are intrinsic differences, essential differences. Women are more emotional, men are more problem solvers. Women are better with children, men are better at saying what they think. And if we delve into MRA/redpiller territory, women are more submissive and look for a strong man, men are more dominant and can't help themselves but fuck anyone with a vagina.

That's bullshit and that's why feminists won't dissolve into an egalitarian movement that deludes itself into thinking it fights for equality while in fact only strengthening the status quo."

The white and black populations in the U.S. are below replacement rate already. We already have the baby boomer generation we are going to deal with, slightly reduced birthrates in risk populations aren't going to offset the issues that already exist.

Yes that's my assumption.

Mostly i did that to point out that there is a much smaller consequence among the gay male community so it's not, relatively speaking, as big of a deal if they don't get vaccinated for HPV. If we play a little hard and lose with how we break down the entire population into those 5 subcategories it becomes a little easier to think about cost/benefit and how the virus might spread given a particular vaccination strategy.

It's also perhaps worth considering that both sides of a lesbian relationship would be immune, so um, i guess they get... uh, double immunity or something. Bisexual women having sex with other women would have the same immunity, which should be safe (in this context), and when they have sex with men you can look at it the same way as a hetero relationship."

Man, that shit was around before you even knew what a ""meme"" was, back when the idea of sharing a social experience was a good thing, but, something you *clearly* didn't consider when deigning to try to make yourself feel bigger than me is that the men that *do* have it are then breeding grounds for variations which then reinfect everyone, making the vaccination in the first place generally ineffective, *especially* for the population that you're describing, because you'd have to have 100% of the women vaccinated, with not a single man currently infected - also, you're completely fucking forgetting that there are about a dozen strains which target each sex individually, but rarely overlap, plus another hundred of so strains which we don't currently see directly linking to cancers.

The only way this even makes sense is if the strains they're vaccinating for *only* produce cancer in women, but the strains that just cause warts cause it in *both* men and women... so... yeah... men having it ""less"" isn't exactly fucking honestly fair, now is it?

That's never how the government evaluates the state's interest when they conflict with Constitutional or other inalienable rights.  We usually balance the interests or we look to see if the government has a compelling interest, and if there are other less intrusive means of meeting the same goal.  

Immediacy and the method in which the disease would be spread (among the age demographic and location listed above) would be crucial factors in balancing those interests, or in determining less intrusive means.

It is possible that the State's interest could become so compelling in light of some of the factors you listed above, if we were certain of those outcomes and there was an immediate need for the state to intervene, but not likely.

The flu is arguably as contagious and deadly (if not more)than HPV.  It's effects will certainly occur, and the immediate need to vaccinate are even more impending than HPV (if you have facts that indicate otherwise we could get into that).  Even so, you can't compel everyone to get a flu shot during flu season (even if you could correctly predict the right strain of flu with 100% certainty for that season)."

I am assuming by that phrasing the OP meant birth control *pills* (condoms are already a form of birth control). Although the pill does have some other medicinal benefits, the main purpose is birth control (hence the name).

Therefore my comment is sound as it relates to OP's comment.

As it relates to STDs, there is some validity to the comment that while condoms are provided (for either gender) which would reduce STD risk to both homosexual male and heterosexual couples, it doesn't help homosexual female couples (other than using condoms on toys or other objects to avoid the exchange of fluids that way). I don't know enough about STD rates to know what kind of risk homosexual female sex transmits STDs or what type of measures work for prevention. Condoms are cheap cheap cheap though, and offering anything else for free in large quantities is likely to be more costly than is affordable to give away."

Basically its ""overall women are oppressed, so nobody should give a shit if men are fucked over here and there to counteract the patriarchy."" They look at it as a math problem, so 90 oppression points on women and 10 on men, any time you can add to the men and reduce the women you get closer to a 50/50. Or thats the logic behind it. 

>why did you lump women and minorities into one category, as if there are not male minorities? 

Intersectionality does that, it is a way of looking at oppression.

> During 2004–2008, an average of 33,369 HPV-associated cancers were diagnosed annually (rate: 10.8 per 100,000 population), including 12,080 among males (8.1 per 100,000) and 21,290 among females (13.2). Multiplying the counts for HPV-associated cancers by percentages attributable to HPV (3), CDC estimated that **approximately 26,000 new cancers attributable to HPV occurred each year, including 18,000 among females and 8,000 among males**.

(emphasis added) ([Source](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6115a2.htm))

6429,"The cancer rates are mostly in much older women who would not have benefited from the vaccine. [We're talking about a cancer with a median age of 48 for diagnosis](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/age.htm), the vaccine will not have had an appreciable impact. "

Also why is the shot $300? Can you explain that to me? Why doesn't the budget cover something that is mass produced? Seems you just take what they say about budget at face value. 

If the budget doesn't allow it than why vaccine be free for only the women? If there isn't money in the budget than how are every female able to get it for free, even the ones to be born? So the young boys don't matter because it isn't in the ""budget""? Sounds stupid as hell."
6450,I got it... lol I just am not about spreading misinformation... especially when most kids who've gone through sex ed probably have no idea what or where the cervix is
6451,"Right. I did more research, and the reason it is so cheap in India is because most of the pharmaceutical companies don't follow patent law. This means they can reverse engineer a sample of vaccine and then mass produce it. So cost of a pallet of vaccine ($300 * 2000 (made up number)) plus cost of reverse engineering plus cost of mass production. This is the cost for a pharmaceutical company in India. In the United States, a company has to pay for years of R&D, lengthy sets of trials, FDA approval, marketing, mass production, getting politicians to support funding of the vaccine, getting doctors to promote the vaccine, etc... 

Comparatively, this is huge cost difference. Because only FDA approved meds are allowed in the US and because the US enforces patent law, a small startup can not reverse engineer and sell the vaccine. So now you have a giant company with 1000's of employees with millions of dollars invested. They have 10 (Not 100% sure on this number) years to make that money back plus profit before they loose patent protection.

We can bitch and moan about all the price ""gouging"" in the United States, but its not as simple as introducing a new law. If they did introduce said law, companies would stop R&D on future projects, which would hurt us down the line. A better idea would to streamline how the FDA works. The EU system has less stringent requirements which lowers costs. That combined with public healthcare funding covers most of the cost problems. 

A potential solution would be to give the government the ability to buy out a patent from a private company. This would be similar to imminent domain.  They would pay for the cost of R&D + FDA approval as well as a settlement fee. Then the government can provide limited patent protection (2 years?) for this company instead of 10-20 like they have now. After this, they ""open source"" the vaccine and allow other Pharmaceutical companies to mass produce the vaccine and sell at close to cost.

Also, in the ""Fear the Walking Dead"" show, it looks like the zombie virus was introduced through the flu vaccine (the mention the vaccine about 100 times in the first two episodes). The outbreak also occurs in 30+ states simultaneously. This is a trope in many zombie stories. I for one, would like to avoid making vaccines janky.  Its like waking up frozen viruses. Its horror movie bad.

6456,">f females are twice as likely to die of something, of course they would be the priority.

Why does this only apply to this one particular instance and everything else must be equal between genders. Two to one is hardly a huge difference when it comes to cancer. A possible cause is that men die earlier of other things anyways since the average detected age is pretty old. Why is the focus not on extending men's lives? You either vouch for equality all the time or you lose the right to make the argument anytime."
6457,"People agreeing with you is the reason why feminism is an antique philosophy. THe moment you start treating sexes differently strictly because they are different sexes, you lose any moral ground to stand on."
6458,"There is no recommended HPV test for men. Men are not tested for it with any frequency at all. There is no accurate way to determine how many men get penile or throat cancer due to HPV, because men are not tested for HPV. The rates of cervical cancer in the UK are 7.5 in 100,000. The rate of throat cancer in men is 6.2. That is not a huge difference. 

I am not saying we should react to everything the same, I am merely asking that men be granted the same level of concern that women are. Men are not being shown that in this case, or the case of abuse shelters.

>If the need was great enough for a men's shelter, they would be there as well. It's not some grand conspiracy against men.

In the same way that if women actually put in the same quality of work as men, they'd earn the same pay. Since there is a wage gap, it must mean they aren't worth as much. See how that mentality looks when applied towards women? You are contributing to negative gender roles/stereotypes. Men should not be expected to be able to grin and bare it when it comes to violence, especially considering how much more of it they face during their life times. The reason there are no shelters for abused men is because there is no public outcry for them, and public outcry is the only reason why they exist for women. Attempts to raise awareness for men's issues it almost always met with hostility, fire alarms being pulled at meeting halls and the like. The entire attitude that men need to look after themselves and not need help needs to change. 

As I said in my previous, violence against men isn't any less wrong than violence against women. A man's life and suffering is just as significant as a woman's. When a man even says 'I'd never hit a woman' he's implying that he'd hit a man, and that is no less monstrous a statement than if another said 'I only hit women'.

Saving a particular group's lives' is good, making even a small effort to save the other's is better."
6459,Nope. Please elaborate more clearly.
6460,"This is how budgeting has always worked in every country that has ever existed. ""What do we think X is worth? How much are we willing to actually spend on X?"" This is nothing new.

You seem to be unaware of what the ultimate goal of a vaccine is: to eliminate a disease from an entire population. This is only achieved through *herd* immunity. Not individual immunity. From what I've read in these comments, the ratio of women:men affected with HPV is roughly 5:3. When you're actively telling half the population that they aren't entitled to a vaccine that affects them nearly as much as the other half of the population (and can be transmitted between both genders to either half of the population), you're not committing to a conducive plan to achieve the ultimate goal: herd immunity. 

You just can't claim that the vaccine has the entire population's interests at heart when the vaccine is only freely available to half the population; the *entire* population needs it in order to actively move toward herd immunity. "
6461,"That's totally different from public health spending. Whether your insurer covers the HPV vaccine is up to the insurer; if you want it, find one that covers it. 

In this case, the gov't is paying money to subsidize the vaccine for girls regardless of insurance. "

6463,"Providing the vaccine to women and homosexual men would cover about everything. I don't see how choosing the most cost effective method is insanity though. They only have money to vaccinate 50% of the population, the method they chose protects 90%. That's a pretty good trade off. "

I never implied that. Men can still bare offspring if they're able to survive throat cancer. [Early cancers are remarkably curable with five-year survival or ""cure rates"" of 80-95%](http://www.mcancer.org/head-and-neck-cancer/voicebox/what-patients-should-know). In many cases of cervical cancer, women have their wombs removed. "
6468,"You're the one who jumped on the guy who asked what feminism had to do with how the vaccine is being applied.

Should British Columbia provide the vaccine free to boys as well as girls? Probably, but I don't know what budget considerations are involved, and HPV-induced cancers currently affect females more than men at a ratio of 5:3. **If** it's true that they could not budget enough to cover everyone, this is a more effective approach than covering first come, first serve - or covering no one.

Having said that, in the US, the CDC recommends vaccinating both boys and girls. Insurance companies don't usually cover both, however. You might call this outright sexism, while I would point to the fact that insurance companies try not to cover anyone for something until enough public pressure is put on them. Granted, a 5:3 ratio does not seem, to me, a big enough spread for excluding one sex, but since my field is not epidemiological statistics, I'm willing to hold judgement about sexism without further information.

As far as feminism being at fault, I point again to the 18th through early 20th century notions of women and children first, prevalent in Western culture long before notions of feminism were taking hold.

6469,">This means we are preventing throat cancer in 7,178 people. Oralpharyngeal cancer has a 5 year survival rate of 83%, so we're talking about saving 1,220 people, at the most.

So we save 1,220 people 5 years of life, typically its between 100k and 200k per person per year. So that's 122mm-240mm, you also have treatment costs for the people who live [throat cancer costs around 40k to treat and 4k per year after that](http://costprojections.cancer.gov/annual.costs.html). So for them getting treatment and living five years and getting hit by a bus, we're looking at 357mm. You still have to treat the people who died from the cancer and they come in at 80k per person assuming that their last year of life is the only costs (not likely) thats another 102mm.

All together you are looking at costs of 581mm just on one of the cancers (albeit the largest). Ignoring the possibility from improved benefits to unvaccinated women or reoccurence in a different site"

I agree.  Though I wouldn't say I distance myself form the label due to the stigma - I'm not worried about the social cost of the label.

6490,"> Again, from a feminist perspective, an egalitarian saying ""keeping the pendulum of power/privilege in the middle"" means keeping things more or less the same with only marginal changes, means status quo, means patriarchy and institutionalized sexism.

This simply isn't true. Being an egalitarian doesn't mean you don't want anything changed. Also, the idea of patriarchy is dubious at best, and seems to be seldom accepted outside of staunchly feminist circles.

> I'm not saying egalitarians view gender issues as a battle of sexes, I'm saying they think feminists view it like that. Which we don't.

It's difficult to not think otherwise, especially when things like ""manspreading"" get addressed with such vitriol and contempt.

> Genitals don't make the gender. That's dismissing the entire trans population. How you identify yourself makes the gender.

Correct, but at the end of the day we are still prisoners to our genes. A transwoman is still biologically a man at the basest level. While we certainly accommodate the findings of psychology into the phenomenon of trangenderism, there will still be things that affect someone who is trans based on the genes they were born with. This is the reason why there is so much pushback in allowing a transwoman to compete in womens MMA. Yes, she's a woman, but she has the body, strength, and endurance of a man. There is a reason for that.

> Differences in the range and distribution of physical attributes. Differences in how illness targets us. Even differences in how we tend to react to hormones, again with a wide range and distribution for all genders.

Yes there are ranges, however the ranges are not the same for both men and women. There are places that overlap, and there are places that do not. Performance in military as a combat unit for example. The top percentages of women perform as well as the bottom percentages of men in a recent study by the Marine Corps. This doesn't happen because of patriarchy, it happens because we are different from one another. This can be applied across psychology and sociology as well. It isn't a *bad* thing that we are different, but it seems like being a man and doing things men enjoy is becoming increasingly frowned upon because they aren't things that women generally do. This could be a reason why more young boys are being put on Ritalin.

> Women are more emotional

Women generally *are* more emotional, just like men are generally more violent and aggressive. There's certainly biological and evolutionary reasons for this. Again, this isn't a bad thing but just ignoring it outright seems like a mistake.

If people wanted the government to pay for their cancer screenings because they like to collective radioactive material or because they want to play russian roulette with syringes that might have cancer cells in them, it would be an entirely different story. Government funded preventative healthcare serves to protect people who would otherwise be defenseless against the diseases they face. Its purpose is not to charge those who choose not to put themselves at risk of developing a condition in order to pay for those who do put themselves at that risk. "

And if you've read my replies to other people, I don't disagree that unwanted pregnancies are more costly than contraception. However, this is not about the most beneficial outcome to society. I personally think that we should pass laws that provide for contraception without tying it to healthcare.

Edit: the reasoning behind not recommending or making it cost free for women over 20 is that most women who are sexually active will already have HPV, so the vaccine won't be as effective.  Again, a cost/benefit determination. 

The vaccine is expensive, so it makes sense to target the programs that subsidize the cost to the demographics that will see the most benefit, i.e. teenage and preteen girls. That's not sexist, it's practical. 

Edit2: Also keep in mind that ""benefit"" in this context is cost savings and incidence reduction. Screening, testing and treating precancerous cervical cancer accounts for $6bn of the $8bn we spend on HPV related healthcare costs. "

6540,"You shouldn't calculate the cost of vaccinating by using 5 years of age. After the first year it would only be administered to children of one birth year, not five. You also included girls who are already given the vaccine when costing what adding males would be which makes zero sense."
6541,">It's at least $300 for a full series. There are ~ 20 million kida between 10-14, so you're looking at billions of dollars to vaccinate them all. That's relatively expensive when you're talking about vaccines, considering we only spend $8bn/yr on HPV related conditions, 3/4 of which is for screening and testing.

6596,Yeah ok because 12 year olds would be the ones paying for it.  For most people it's covered under insurance anyway.
6597,"Yes, but there are over 150 types of HPV and the vaccine protects against 2 or 4 types  depending on which vaccine is used. The 2 was made to prevent the common strains involved with cervical cancer and not necessarily the ones involved in throat cancer, although my limited looking into this tells me maybe it does to some extent. The quadravalent vaccine adds protection to two strains common in causing genital warts."

Because Merck charges a lot for the vaccine. Patents/the cost of medicine is a whole separate issue. But like I said, we live in the real world.

>If the budget doesn't allow it than why vaccine be free for only the women? If there isn't money in the budget than how are every female able to get it for free, even the ones to be born? So the young boys don't matter because it isn't in the ""budget""? Sounds stupid as hell.

Do you **really** need an ELI5 about how a freaking budget works? There is $X. They can spend it to vaccinate anyone who wants it, until the money runs out.

> In the same way that if women actually put in the same quality of work as men, they'd earn the same pay. Since there is a wage gap, it must mean they aren't worth as much. See how that mentality looks when applied towards women? You are contributing to negative gender roles/stereotypes.

I'm saying that the feminist narrative (of sexism being this unidirectional issue of male privilege and female victimhood) means it's not being taken seriously as sexism against women. And therefore overtly sexist policies like this against men/boys are a hell of a lot more likely to happen than overtly sexist policies against women/girls.

My personal view is that zero discrimination based on sex by government should be allowed and that line in the sand should be held, even if in a small minority of situations (when looked at on their own) the argument for equality might not be that strong. I don't think raising taxes (and realistically by a tiny amount) to maintain this moral line in the sand is a big deal."

There are fewer women in STEM majors, but for a long time girls in elementary or middle school would be discouraged from doing STEM stuff or told that engineering toys/games/hobbies were for boys.  If you start getting kids interested in stuff when they're young, they'll be more likely to choose it when they're older.  Saying something like that is like saying, ""Well men must not be interested in being fathers, look how few work in daycares.""  It's silly.

But as for the vaccination thing... it's not a problem here in the US (this article only pertains to Canada) so I would assume that's the reason why no major feminist groups have campaigned for it.  The HPV vaccine costs the same for boys and girls here in the US, and is usually free if you're uninsured or prove you can't pay for it.  It's not included in the list of required vaccinations, but the CDC page STRONGLY recommends vaccinating your kids, and even makes a special point to explain why it's so important for boys to get it as well as girls.

It is almost certain that the woman in question is pretty liberal.  Almost all left-leaning women are feminists.  She might be an outlier, but it's more likely than not that she identifies as feminist.

This is not a statement of fact, it's an educated guess about probability.  There are plenty of women in news stories who, based on who they are being covered by and how they are being covered and what specific issue they are in a story for, I would definitely not assume to be feminist."

Referring back to feminists raising awareness of men's issues, I'm particularly vocal about male victims of domestic abuse. There's a limited amount that I can do other than make the point when it comes up and donate to relevant shelters and charities, but anyone saying they're a feminist should be doing similar things. I think it's more suitable to think of the movement's as a defence of things perceived as feminine - deconstructing expectations of what a man 'should be', or what they necessarily experience, etc. is part of that. "
6632,"The important thing is choice.  A man should be able to *choose* to be a stay at home dad, or maybe he wants to be a lifelong bachelor.  Right now, it's more taboo for the guy to choose the former, and that's something many feminists want changed.  Just like they want to give women the right to *choose* whether or not she goes all her life without kids, or becomes the stereotypical 1950's housewife.  Just because that option is provided does not mean you must choose it.  It just means there are more options.

There are plenty of things happening to men right now that need to be fixed.  Making fun of boys for crying, for one.  Or for choosing traditionally feminine hobbies and careers.  The fact that men feel uncomfortable babysitting or taking their kids to a park.  This issue being discussed in the thread here with the HPV vaccine.

6642,"Yes, having sex is a voluntary action. So is leaving your house. You're not going to catch measles if you don't leave your house (unless someone breaks in).

As a society we agree that a normal healthy productive life includes lots of voluntary behaviours that may carry an increased risk of injury or disease: leaving your house, playing sports, eating animal products, working at a computer, working at a stressful job, standing for prolonged periods, having children, reading, driving, and yes, having sex. There is absolutely no plausible reason why having sex shouldn't be on that list.

And you still haven't addressed the practical point, which is that one way or another, if you buy health insurance or pay taxes to fund a public health insurance plan, you're going to pay for the fact that people have sex. Either you're going to pay a little for contraceptives, or you're going to pay a whole lot more for pregnancy and delivery. Those are the only two options under any realistic health plan.

I suppose you *could* imagine a hypothetical world where health insurance paid for all healthcare costs except for reproductive health - where people had to pay cash for prenatal care and delivery. But that would be a world with a lot of dead women and infants and even more insanely expensive emergency room visits and NICU stays.

6685,"Women are about twice as likely to get *some* kind of HPV-related cancer as men, according to that report.  

Women experience about 2,800 cases per year and men experience about 1,270 cases per year.  That is the count of cancers that are ""HPV-associated"".  So about a 2:1 ratio.  

Of those, the proportion that are ""attributable"" to HPV are 1,993 and 494 cases for women and men, respectively.  So about a 4:1 ratio.  

But as long as we're cherry-picking, men experience twice as many cases of HPV-associated oral cancer as women (6.5 / 100,000 vs 3.3 / 100,000).  

Given this distribution, subsidies should see a proportional application weighted toward women to some ratio like 4:1 or 2:1, not ∞:1

6689,"Two to one is nothing when it comes to healthcare. It's the difference between 10000 deaths and 20000 deaths. Healthcare goes by orders of magnitude.

Look at it this way. Women have a .1% (made up number) chance of dying from something. They need a vaccine. Men have a 0.05% chance of dying from something, fuck them. Does this seem fair to you?

As far as your comment that men and women are different medically. Why are insurance rates the same? Shouldn't women pay a higher insurance since they receive more care? Or should it be ""equal"" in this case because women are at a disadvantage?

6692,"It's not being sexist it's being economically efficient.

If every girl gets the vaccine for free then parents will have no reason *not* to get it. It's a free vaccine that protects their child from a disease that has far larger medical cost down the road. As the price starts increasing you begin to have more people dropping off because they can't afford the vaccine, or because they deem the cost too high for the risk-reward. Do I think that's a healthy sentiment? No, but it's one that exists and will continue to exist anyway.

If the vaccine is free for all girls though, you have a much larger portion of them vaccinated. It's a lot safer to have 100% of the girls vaccinated and 1/3 of the boys than the have 2/3rds of both. It's not sexism, it's efficiency."

6695,"Throat cancer is easily curable in early stages and gives obvious enough symptoms to be found and treated in these early stages. Cervical cancer has very little to offer in terms of early stage symptoms. Routine pap smears (that detect cervical cancer) are typically done once a year. Gender aside, it's easy to see which is more dangerous as per ease of detection. 

Again, men and women are biologically different, and we each have different needs accordingly. This has less to do with social structure and more to do with pure biology."
6696,">I'm saying that the feminist narrative means it's not being taken seriously as sexism against women.

Yeah, and I disagree. It's the relative awareness of how much HPV can inflict cancer on men. You get the word out on that, you'll have usable pressure to get this funded just the way that other vaccines get applied equally.

>I don't think raising taxes (and realistically by a tiny amount) to maintain this moral line in the sand is a big deal.

If everything that should be funded were funded, the system would fail. There will always be things that should be done, lives that are worth more than the money won't spend on saving them; that's life. This isn't the place where you want to plant the equality flag; the inequality here isn't sexism, it's an awareness thing. 

You think the fight against breast cancer is so good at raising money because of the evil feminist agenda? Nope - it's just a really well-oiled machine working well, like any of the other good ones through the years - Jerry's Kids, March of Dimes, the bucket challenge, an so on."

If I'm understanding your contention, they aren't on dialysis or other treatments, if the cancer is avoided completely its the full time.

> The point is that the cost benefit analysis has been done by people with a far more in depth understanding than us, and it clearly isn't worth it on the national level

CDC backed it, United States backs it, Alberta backed it, PEI backed it. [CBA's have shown it to be cost effective](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20713101). The idea that it is clearly isn't worth it is not supported. Other studies note the [effectiveness is substantial even with a relatively high adoption rate of 70%](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/13/10).

If you start assuming that there will be an adoption rate among women in the high 90s then maybe not. But we're nowhere close to that level.

I mean, you can believe whatever you want, personally I think misandry and misogyny are roughly equal, although the raging misandry I see from the feminist movement is neither ignoreable nor forgiveable - one example which is very typical of the *fem*inist outlook is the UN's ""global gender gap"" report where countries which a huge female>male imbalance in university admissions were given a perfect score for ""gender equality"" in university admissions : 

https://i.imgur.com/flgIiS9.png

6706,"That ignores the fact in college women choose to avoid going into stem majors. You can't say young women are discouraged in college where the opportunity is easily available yet they have repeatedly chosen not to pursue it in either high-school or college, furthermore the idea that young girls have been discouraged in elementary and middle school ignores the historical reality. Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel prize and a second one, her daughter won one also in 1935. Her family is famous for winning 5 Nobel prizes all together. If marie curie was able to not only succeed in such a field but be lauded as a great mind of her time in a period where women were believed to be historically confided to certain roles i have a hard time believing we now have more discrimination and discouragement for young girls trying to get into science especially after second wave feminism. Normally when people tell you, you can't do something you do it just to spite them, Tuskegee airmen, the whole women can do anything men can do ring a bell?

I've never been encouraged to get into stem stuff, for the most part science, engineering and chemistry is usually considered a ""nerd"" pastime. The people who get involved in the fields are the people who're extremely passionate about it, not because boys are pushed more towards that field. Boys are more pushed into athletic avenues at a young age than anything. How many pewee football leagues are their versus kid science programs?

But to go even further how many kids actually stay interested in football or basketball when they're old enough to choose what they want to do? only the kids who're extremely dedicated to that interest stick with it. I think this is less of a case of actual discrimination and more of the fact people throwing other social issues on a field due to perceived bias inherit in the lack of more women being represented in science instead of people maybe considering that not that many people are are interested in stem career fields and a higher percentage of women even less so. After all we have plenty notable examples of women in the field already so anyone stating such fields are not open to women would look like idiots because a simple cursory review of a science textbook would prove them wrong. Instead we have people demonizing the guy who was apart of the team who landed that spacecraft unto the comet for wearing a shirt designed by a woman friend of his so her business could get some notable exposure as a misogynist and sexist all because of a shirt. 

The gender specific toys thing, free the nipple are all not problems in the us(the breast feeding thing depends on how you view breast in general) men can roam topless because it's not sexualized. Rather that's right or wrong is another topic entirely, you don't see men parading around our penis which is the equivalent to a female breast or vagina to most people. The female breast is acknowledged to be something sexual by universally everyone rather that's positive or negative, even with the rise of secularism so you can't state it's simply due christian puritanical values even though they did play a part in the stigma of naked breast. 

Just look at the amount of people who want boob jobs, buy dresses to emphasize their chest or take selfies with their tits prominently on display. You cannot compare it to something relatively non sexual to something that is extremely sexual and reinforced as sexual daily. Men don't go around emphasizing our penis size or making them look more enticing. I do however believe shaming a woman for breastfeeding is the heart of retardation, i don't even know when this became an issue, i do believe the stigma of a naked breast needs to be removed from our society and that seeing them on tv, video-games or reading about should not be a idiotic taboo just don't act like they're not sexual. But the rest of your comment thanks for informing me, did not know all of that pertinent information, i thought the vaccination was free, i remember all those commercials encourage young girls to get the vaccine when i was younger i assumed it was a government initiative.

Yes, you can say that men are in power and they're listened to, but that's like saying Sarah Palin represents women, the men in power don't represent the common man, the common man is ignored.  You may think men ""derail"" conversations about gender equality, but that's because nobody's ever really willing to listen to us.

Keep on trolling."
6723,"You are classifying pregnancy as equivalent to injury or disease, but I won't get into that. Most of those things you have listed are not voluntary, they are necessary to function. Sex is not. But let's take sports as an example. If you get injured and the government is paying for your healthcare, then obviously it will have to pay for your medical costs. However, we would not say that preventative healthcare extends to purchasing you mouthguards and shin guards in order to prevent injuries. As beneficial as those things may be, they are not preventative care and we wouldn't make non-athletes who don't like sports pay for them via taxes. Or suppose there were a pill that can decrease your chance of getting soft tissue injuries. Again, while it may be helpful and even cost effective, it is not acceptable to make people who do not play sports pay for athletes to take that pill without first putting it through the legislative process on its own merit. There is no onus for the government to provide preventative care for voluntary activities. Preventative care should only be provided if it is for something that you *must* do, not for something that you *want* to do. If there is a social benefit from providing it, then pass a law allowing for that social benefit, but do not include it as part of necessary healthcare. Make it about something other than sex and you'll realize that it makes sense. Ask yourself if you think the government should charge taxpayers in order to provide basketball and volleyball players with precautionary knee braces.


As far as buying health insurance, I'm ok with that because you have a choice of what insurance you purchase. The issue is the government forcing you to pay for something via taxes while shoehorning it into legislation where it does not belong. Again, I'm not opposed to the government paying for reproductive health. Suppose you get into a car accident and you are on Medicaid. The government needs to pay for your hospital bills to treat your injuries, but that doesn't mean that the government is responsible for installing airbags and seat belts in your car. That is outside the scope of healthcare, just as contraception is outside the scope of healthcare.

This is a more inquisitive question and not an attempt to trap you, but what kind of contraception do you support exactly? I assume birth control, but do you think the government should pay for condoms too? Why or why not?"
6724,"Again, nope. You're once again missing the point. There is no moral argument being made. There's lots of things that are beneficial to society which I think the government should do, but there are laws which the government has to follow. I think the government should specifically help black people in order to close the income gap between races. However, the government must treat all people equal, so we can't just add give black people money to the next year's budget. If I want the government to do that, they need to pass new laws which would allow them to do it. 

The same is true of contraception. Contraception is not healthcare if it is not being used to deal with health issues. Subsidizing a recreational activity is not healthcare regardless of the benefits. If we want to provide free contraception because of the benefits, we need to get it through Congress on that merit. We are a democratic republic and people have a say on where their tax dollars are spent. Some modicum of healthcare may be a basic human right, but contraception is not. If people are going to subsidize a recreational activity based on its benefits, they have a right to be represented and have their representatives vote on their behalf. We have laws and they need to be followed. Assuming that anyone who disagrees with you does so because they are ""weird about sex"" just makes you look like a complete ass. Keep stereotyping though.

(""Better safe than sorry"") Vaccination programs have limited resources and so the most effective way to administer them is to target demographics who can potentially benefit the most in order to maximize the potential health benefits and savings. It sounds harsh, but public health policy is about doing the most good for the most people, not making things fair for individuals. Again, I personally think the vaccine should be covered for everyone but I understand why it isn't. 

Edit: and apparently this is all a moot point for me, because the ACA now requires plans to cover the vaccine for both genders. Learn something new everyday. "

6733,"Well I dont think there's necessarily a lawyer shortage, but the issue isn't the cost of eduction for doctors. Half of doctor education is various practical terms anyway, in which they're billable/salaried.  

The real issue is medical and professional cartels and education industrial complex artificially limiting the number of doctors and nurses in training.  

For no cost you could move from a 20 seat lecture hall to a 60 or 100 seat room.  A few bucks of extra cash to hire two or three teaching assistants instead of one, and the cost would be more than captured by tuition anyway.  Exam halls can seat 200 as easily as they can seat 20.  Labs would cost more.  

By massively increasing the number of trained doctors, user costs would shrink, waiting lists would vanish, and god complexes would all but disappear.  But then doctors might only make as much as top workers in IT, education, service, hospitality, science, retail and other fields.  They'd no longer be ""rich"".

6740,"> In this case no because the vaccine is more efficient if it's given before becoming sexually active.

It's also more efficient at preventing cervical cancer if it's administered to women alone than it is if administered to men alone. This is the crux of the reasoning behind the policy to allocate limited resources to selectively funding vaccination with Gardasil to females (girl and women) first.

> Age discrimination is an entirely different subject. It's normal that at certain age we stop giving medical procedures. Else would you want all organs to be given to 70+ years old people who smoked their whole life (for lungs) or chronic 80+ years olf alcoholics (for liver) ?

You're acknowledging that there are some groups in society which are not equally entitled to potentially life-saving medical procedures, even if they are available, although access is limited. This conflicts with what you previously wrote: 

> If something can prevent a disease you make it available to EVERYONE who can get the disease not just a group of people!

There are valid reasons for age discrimination in the healthcare sector, as there are valid reasons for gender-based discrimination.

> Name me one single other medical drug, vaccine, procedures for which there is a sex difference. Name me ONE that does not imply organs that the other sex doesn't have.

Um, men and women are physically pretty different in many significant respects, hence the necessity to treat them differently in many different medical contexts. In the present context, men don't have cervixes, and women do. If the rationale behind the government's policy to fund vaccination against HPV was to prevent the incidence of warts, but there were only so many doses that were available free of charge each year, then it'd make sense to offer it on a first come/first served basis, provided everyone in society were affected equally.

In this case, the government isn't so much concerned about vaccinating against HPV to prevent the general population from developing warts, but to prevent women from developing cervical cancer as a result of HPV infection. What about the gender non-specific cancers which HPV is known to cause? Well, if there is only a limited number of doses the government can fund per year, and not everyone can be covered, who gets priority? Should it still be offered on a first come, first served basis? Is everyone equally at risk of adverse health complications if they do become infected with HPV?"
6741,"Also depends on your audience.

If I was giving a talk to a panel of engineers my opinion of management might get a little over the top for effect.

If I'm giving a talk to a varied audience I would likely structure my language and choose my words differently.

This was an interview about radical feminism, on a site about radical feminism; which from what I read I disagree with a lot, but there was still some interesting points made nestled in the more extreme views.

As seen by her other writing she has very lucid and informed opinions, and I am not eager to completely dismiss those simply because she also belongs to other more extreme groups.

If she can keep the two separate, I'm personally happy to have her input. Some of the articles I read were incredibly well done and discuss a lot of the disconnect between what feminism was and what is has become.

I do agree though that poisoning the well is a very common thing in these kinds of discussions and I harbour no illusions that it will stop if I point it out ;)"
6742,"The whole discussion was taken out of context.

I really felt some of the earlier quotes taken out of context misrepresent her point.

I don't agree with all of what she has to say but the key point in removing gender isn't that men are bad and we should all call ourselves neuchachos; but that gender is a needless abstraction placed over sex(as in male or female) that enforced stereotypes.

And there is some truth to that, we do associate womanly with weak or social, and manly with independent with strong. But the way she was quoted strips it of that context and makes her point sound like nonsense.

I am totally okay with people disagreeing with her, in fact I disagree with a lot of he points she makes; but by misrepresenting her we are robbing ourselves of the ability to even understand what arguments are being made and with that lose our ability to even disagree with her. Instead we all just end up calling everyone names which is incredibly unproductive, and doesn't help either side."

6760,"That's the hardest I've ever seen someone work to say, ""Women are for sexy times and hate sciencey brain stuff.""  I'm almost impressed."
6761,"Argument is as follows:

- The CBC is a liberal organization.  Liberal media organizations are generally feminist.

- The woman in the story is being given very very sympathetic coverage, to the point where I'd call bias (bias I agree with, but bias nonetheless).  She is a significant public figure who has political connections.  The story is just portraying her as a typical mom.  This is actually really bad reporting.  The CBC is basically participating as a co-advocate for her cause.  Of course, media organizations do this all the time, toward all sorts of different biases, liberal and conservative.

- So the CBC sees her very much as an ally.  This means she probably has a connection with the CBC and she is on their side politically.  This means there's a pretty good chance that she's very liberal herself.

- Very liberal women tend to be feminist.

- Furthermore, if you start googling around on her, she appears to be involved in several groups and boards for women in medical science.  She's received awards from women in science organizations.  Again, all of these kinds of things correlate very highly with strong liberalism.  Non-liberal women's organization tend to have the word ""conservative"" or something similar right in the title, the neutral sounding ones skew left.

- So she is, not certainly, but quite likely, a very liberal women.  The number of very liberal women who would not call themselves feminists is vanishingly small.

- Lastly, HPV vaccination has been a feminist issue for a while.  A while back the FDA was holding up approval, and feminist organizations cried sexism.  HPV for young boys has been a feminist issue, because it's still about preventing cervical cancer in women.  The HPV vaccine, like a lot of vaccines, isn't 100% effective, so it's a herd immunity issue.  The thing works better if everyone, male and female, has the vaccine.  I've been hearing women talk about this for years and years.

- All of this is my reasoning for my original claim that ""I'd bet"" she is a feminist.  The very nature of that phrasing, a bet, implies uncertainty.  I'd also bet that Bobby Jindal isn't going to be elected president next year, but hey, I could be wrong there too."
6762,"Well, I know HPV can be transmitted in ways other than PiV sex, if that's what you mean. However, most would still classify the other methods of transmission as a form of sex. I've spent a great deal of time studying HPV and I'm genuinely curious to know what you have to say."

6765,"Yeah, of course. It's not cute either way, calling that stuff out is pretty par for the course. As for including men, of course, whenever they want to join the conversation. In my experience I think a lot are uncomfortable to jump in though, since the public perception of feminism also supporting men isn't hugely strong. And yeah, I see what you're saying about the men in power thing, that's very true. I think it's less about the fact that there's a guy in the white house (for the American types) and more abut a general leaning of society (men and women) towards affording men more opportunities, pay, etc. Of course, there are two sides to that coin, with things pertaining to self expression, being taken seriously when attacked and so forth often being limited. When men's issues get brought up in conversations it does sometimes come across as derailing, because then you might have two sides who are both trying to emphasis that one gender is having X/Y issue, instead of one or both parties trying to emphasise that both genders are having issues that link back to society's attitudes towards traditionally feminine traits. 

Crikey, this is starting to sound like a uni essay. Am I making sense? I don't think that criticism of feminism is always seem as an attack on women, but when it is I think it mainly stems from miscommunication. A lot of people are really familiar with second wave feminism (bra burning, man hating...), and less familiar with current (non radical, cross gender equality) versions. It's understandable that it'd come across as one big mixed message and muddy communications. The current wave of teens on tumblr trying to practice baby's first feminism isn't helping much, either, but at least they'll learn as they grow."

(There was a test somewhere where they let a man take photos of his child in a public pool, they let the woman do the same, the man was asked to leave because he made everyone uncomfortable and the woman wasn't)
* The exceptionally big difference in punishment between men and women, for the same crimes.
* The fact that a sexually abused child, if done by a female power figure (teacher, sports coach, etc.), is joked about as if he has to have enjoyed it and that therefore the girl isn't at fault.
* In domestic abuse cases the male is at almost all times the perpetrator, even if he is the one calling for aid. Call services will often redirect any man who connects to them to the line to avoid committing domestic abuse or they will be laughed at. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/VlfZY3C.jpg)
* The fact that boys are basically treated as faulty girls for being boys in schools and other places. Forced to take medicine if they act a bit too much like a boy.
* The physical and mental stress some guys have to live through for long periods of time because admitting it can be seen as weak or whiny in a lot of places, I think this is a part of the high suicide rates men face.

6797,">The question is how many extra will get it. How many men will suddenly think ""HPV vaccine is free? Better go get it."" like it's some kind of joy to get random vaccines, without taking into account their personal risks? The truth is the sentiment that made for these cost differences in the first place are the same sentiments of the general population: men don't really need it. To make it more available to anyone would allow *those most at risk* to get it (like homosexual men). I don't see why there would be a massive increase of those not at risk getting it, given that's it's 100% voluntary and mostly recommended by doctors. Are the recommendations of doctors going to change? No.

How many people? Extremely likely that it's far more than it would actually benefit from it.* That's exactly why we have copays, because even $5 makes people stop and evaluate whether they actually need something vs. just getting it because they can. There are lots of studies out there that show this clearly. 

As I said in my edit, this is a moot point, because the ACA requires coverage for both genders as do most provinces in Canada, and B.C., which this article is talking about, already made it available to high risk men. 

Edit: To clarify, from a strictly cost/benefit perspective, it's not been proven to be as efficient to offer cost free programs to everyone. From an equality and fairness perspective, there's great benefit. The governments have found the latter to be compelling and that's great. 

Edit2: Keep in mind,  HPV vaccines are targeted at preteens and teenagers, so their parents will be making the decisions."

No I don't. Read the post again. I said that feminism's view of gender victimhood *perpetuated* the denial of male victimhood (i.e it was around before, feminism just perpetuated it - aswell as either perpetuating or not really doing anything about a huge amount of other pro-female/anti-male norms - while fighting against pro-male/anti-female norms).

Any person who sees gender norms as bidirectional is going to see the hypocrisy in this. But someone who has bought into the unidirectional view of sexism outlined in feminist theory is not going to take pro-female/anti-male sexism seriously in anything other than a trivial, secondary way. And given the fact that feminism has held hegemony over the pro-equality side of the equality discussion, you get a society which has only ever heard one side of the story in any great level of detail, and the other side of the story is left undealt with (how convenient). Not to mention the contempt for men/boys amongst women/girls this unidirectional view of sexism is likely to create, and the reactionary contempt for women/girls a huge amount of men/boys are likely to develop upon seeing this misandric attitude."

When only 75% of girls will be vaccinated (under ideal circumstances) and often closer to half actually are, men will receive virtually no benefit from the vaccination of women. Further the women who aren't vaccinated will receive much less of the benefits from those who are. 

[In fact vaccinating a boy at the age of 12 currently shows a higher benefit than vaccinating a woman over the age of 25.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2769256/)

If we cover a catchup program for girls, we should definitely cover boys, if we need to raise more funds, scrap the catch up program and fund the younger boys. 

Whats more, vaccinating boys at the age of 12 is the only effective way to really vaccinate them while the vaccine is still effective. The average age that [they'll come out is 18](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/06/13/a-survey-of-lgbt-americans/) around the time where they're pushing the limits for the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Are you seriously being this much of an idiot?

First of all, no, they aren't made up shit, if you start dismissing arguments that way you can dismiss about all feminist arguments as well.

Second of all, I have never in my while chain of comments bitched about feminism, I explained what problems men have to face and why MRAs exist, if me explaining these issues gets such a reaction from you I guess MRAs aren't really useless in this world.

And here you are bitching about male rights while telling me to stop my imaginary bitching about feminism.

6824,Contraception is covered under the ACA but it is not healthcare. That is improperly followed legislative procedure. It's pretty straightforward. You're an ass who can't handle the fact that making people pay for something voluntary is a super shitty thing to do if the issue never went to a vote but was instead shoehorned in as part of an unrelated law.

No, they aren't.  By your own admission, one group is nearly 100% more at risk than the other.  Your response to that was a variant of ""it's not medically significant.""  

Personally, I think that's simply bullshit.  When almost two women will be affected for every single man, that's significant.  I don't care what some guy studying stats says; we're talking about real people living and dying.  

When it's your mother, or sister, or grandparent or close friend in the hospital, I hope someone comes along and reminds you ""hey man, it's no biggee.  Medical stats work on orders of magnitude; this isn't significant.""

> The resources aren't limited in the way you think.

Really?  Because you haven't said anything like this up till now.  If the resources are not limited, then where are they?  Then where is the money to pay for them coming from?  Are you claiming to understand the entire financial spending on vaccines in the Canadian healthcare system?

EDIT: Were you even aware that this is a time-limited free trial?  As in, soon enough, women will have to pay for the vaccine just like men.  So your precious equality will be restored in time.  Just ignore the medical system trying to prevent some deaths, and soon enough it'll all be good."

So, I knew it was important to keep in mind, didn't know the full extent of the risk. Thank you."
6898,"> Why does it mention age?

Because it is likely that you will, at some point in your life, get HPV from physical contact. After a certain age, it's almost certainly the case and a vaccine won't be of use anymore since there is a reasonable chance you're already carrying the virus.

> What exactly will the vaccine do and what specifically does it protect you from?

The HPV vaccine is made of virus-like particles. These particles are made from HPV capsule proteins. These proteins trigger a response from the immune system, since they do not belong in our body. The immune system recognises and destroys the proteins, while building a 'memory' for these particles. So when you do get exposed to the complete HPV virus after getting the vaccine, the immune system instantly recognises the HPV capsule proteins, attacks and destroys them. No infection can occur, because the virus was destroyed before it had an opportunity to settle down.

> Where can I get the vaccine?

At your doctor's office.

6921,"I believe that the HPV vaccine was originally marketed towards women. There was a whole campaign aimed at mothers to encourage them to vaccinate their daughters.  

Why women? The three leading causes of gynecological cancer in US women by incidence: 1. Uterine 2. Ovarian 3. Cervical and by deaths: 1. Ovarian 2. Uterine 3. Cervical. However, in the world cervical cancer is #1 cause of both cases and deaths among the gynecological cancers. Why the discrepancy? Because we enact practices like the HPV vaccine (only protects against cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancer but not endometrial/ovarian) and pap smears. We prevent the cancer from happening or at least catch it before it becomes cancer. Can't do that for ovarian and we're not very good at it for endometrial. 

Why not marked to boys/men? First of all, it is recommended for both boys and girls. Secondly, anal, laryngeal, and penile cancer are much rarer causes of death in men."
6922,"Why do you think the job vaccine isn't for men? 

I got it just fine when I asked my doc.

It's possible that women aren't getting vaccinated as often because of religious or social pressures and thus need more encouraging I suppose.
"
6923,"Due to reasons that others have stated, it is currently being transitioned into a vaccine for young males and females. My little brother got it with advice from his pediatrician a year or so ago. I would assume that it had previously only been given to women because the possibility for cancer in males wasn't well known, and the smaller side effects of a male having it aren't that troublesome. "
6924,[removed]
6925,"All of your respondents have the cart before the horse.

Cervical cancer is caused by a persistent HPV infection by a high risk strain (there are 14). But we didn't always know this. Sexually transmitted infections were suspect for many years but it wasn't until 1983 that a guy by the name of Harald zur Hazen proved/demonstrated it.

It was after zur Hazen proved the HPV link that a concerted effort to come up with a vaccine got under way. It took 23 years!

When the gardasil vaccine was approved by the FDA in 2006, zur Hazen was awarded the Nobel prize in medicine for his discovery because we could now save about a quarter million women per year from death by cervical cancer and about half a million from having to undergo the treatment for cancer that would save their lives but almost always leave them infertile at a minimum.

AND, it will save million upon millions from the various procedures that are meant to prevent cervical cancer. They are expensive and uncomfortable and also can cause infertility.

AND, it can prevent 90% of all cases of genital warts...if you get the vaccine.

But notice where we started? It all began as a quest to prevent cervical cancer. All the research was aimed at cervical cancer. That's why the target is women.

Along the way to creating the vaccine, the link to oropharyngeal, anal and penile cancer was discovered.

I see that a verified respondent says this oropharyngeal link is not ""well correlated"". That is news to me but I'm an autodidact. I'm still suspicious.

"
6926,"It was originally being marketed because it protects against HPV caused cancers, and for awhile we only knew that it was cervical cancer. However we are starting to find that other types of cancers, like ""throat cancer"" is also caused in large part by HPV.

I tell all of my patients, both male/female, to get the vaccination. Providers just need to do a better job of encouraging everyone to get it in their youth before it is too late for them. Once you start having sex or kissing, you're putting yourself at risk for catching the HPV strains that are dangerous and can cause cancer."
6927,"As another user said, the primary reason is that males get cancer from HPV far less than females do.

The secondary reason is that HPV vaccines are very expensive. A lot of government were initially hesitant to recommend HPV for females because $350 per shot for half the population was hard to justify. It turned out from the Australian trial (it was where Gardasil was developed) that the vacccine was actually pretty cost-effective in developed countries. (Unfortunately many developing countries cannot afford HPV vaccines.) However it has taken a bit more time to establish the cost-benefit of vaccinating boys as well. It is hard to assess the benefit when the subjects (males) are not even primary beneficiaries.

There is currently a strong push to get boys immunised as well (for herd immunity as well as shielding them from these HPV strains). Some countries fully cover HPV vaccines for both sexes, whereas in others they are limited to females (or only partially covering males). This transition is quite recent and still in progress, and policy change just takes time. "
6928,"> Secondly, anal, laryngeal, and penile cancer are much rarer causes of death in men.

Huh? The whole point is to stop transmitting HPV to women. If men are vaccinated against HPV then HPV prevalence will go down, as will cervical cancer in women."
6929,"It's not recommended for men over 21 (except men who have sex with men, then only up to age 26.) Not that it's particularly harmful, and few doctors would actually refuse to give it to a man over 21, but insurance may not cover the bill. "
6930,"Every reference I've ever seen to the vaccine in media has been as the ""cervical cancer vaccine,"" and targeted at girls in the US. 

Maybe that is to avoid suggesting that adolescent girls should be vaccinated against genital warts or something.

But why isn't it also publicized as a vaccine for some forms of throat cancer, or is that an entirely different and unprotected strain of HPV?"
6931,"Oh good point. I'm sorry - I totally forgot about that reason. What I was getting at is that it's harder to market it to men when it's not a common cause of cancer in that population even though the point is that it stops the transmission to women, as you state."
6932,"Its difficult enough to convince someone to vaccinate their child for the child's benefit, let alone to benefit overall public health."
6933,"You're not wrong, but that's not a strong selling point when it comes to medical care. Herd immunity is a benefit of vaccinations but most people are probably thinking only about themselves when getting their flu shots. "
6934,"Couple reasons for that specifically.

First it's to avoid any mention of the vaccine and sex together, because there is a large portion of the population who will refuse to get the vaccine if you do because ""my girl won't have sex till marriage"" and ""sex shouldn't be risk free, that means girls will have more sex"".

These are the same idiots pushing to make abortion illegal and pushing for abstinence only sex ""education"".

Boys don't face that pressure because boys having sex before marriage is totally normal.

The other reason is to attach the bogeyman of cancer to the vaccine.

It's basically to try and get people to think of it as having nothing to do with sex and rather just to prevent cancer."
6935,">But why isn't it also publicized as a vaccine for some forms of throat cancer, or is that an entirely different and unprotected strain of HPV?

Epidemiologically, oropharyngeal cancer and cancer-causing HPV strains aren't well correlated:

>Studies have found that about 7% of people in the United States have oral HPV, but only 1% of people have the type of oral HPV that is found in oropharyngeal cancers (HPV type 16). Oral HPV is about three times more common in men than in women.

The studies also simply aren't in place to make those claims:

>The HPV vaccine also could prevent oropharyngeal cancers because the vaccine prevents infection with HPV types that can cause oropharyngeal cancers, but studies have not been done to show if the HPV vaccine prevents oropharyngeal cancers.

https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/basic_info/hpv_oropharyngeal.htm"
6936,">What I was getting at is that it's harder to market it to men when it's not a common cause of cancer in that population

This isn't true. HPV-related oral cancer is common in men. While not as common as cervical cancer, it is second to cervical cancer in terms of HPV-related cancer incidence. The rate is relatively high for men: [in 2008, there were 5,658 cases (5.2 per 100,000 men), compared with 10,966 cases of cervical cancer (9.0 per 100,000 women)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3037092/)."

I'm also not a statistician, however I took a look at the published report, and while the P values for the post-vaccinations look pretty good, the pre-vaccination P values do not. I believe that means it's hard to make the claim that there was a 61% reduction, because you can't make the claim that the pre-vaccination numbers are statistically significant.

6987,"2 or 3 people over 100 000 people will die from cervical cancer according to the CDC, and that rate is going down.

The debate on Gardasil is not whether it is good or bad (why would it be bad...) but really it is a cold cut benefits/costs analysis.  we don't have unlimited amounts of money and if the gov pays millions and millions it means those millions don't get spent on something else.  

lets recap:

0.6 % of all women will get cervical cancer, and 70% of those are caused by HPV.  Vaccine costs well over 300$ per dose to the gov.  which means to prevent one case of cancer you must vaccinate over what 200-300 people roughly. 

this is what you must calculate, but you know, that's none of my business I suppose.  have fun when you bankrupt your health care system and then people with no insurance or money cannot get treated for simple diseases or tooth aches or broken arms.

The vaccines have been shown to provide protection against persistent cervical HPV 16/18 infections for up to 8 years, which is the maximum time of research follow-up thus far. More will be known about the total duration of protection as research continues (7).

HPV vaccination has also been found to prevent nearly 100 percent of the precancerous cervical cell changes that would have been caused by HPV 16/18. The data so far show duration of production for up to 6.4 years with Cervarix and for up to 5 years for Gardasil—in women who were not infected with HPV at the time of vaccination (7–10)."""

Just get them frozen off. Your immune system will do the rest, over time. It may take a year or two for them to go away completely. I also had them at your age, but they went away with regular freezing. "

7132,"The HPV Vaccine is one of the clearest and obvious examples of through scientific understanding from the atomic level, up through human cancer.  We understand the chain of causality from the viral DNA to human cancer well enough to make not getting the vaccine seem very improper.  

The very mechanism of the virus to sustain itself is to disable your DNA repair machinery - which incidentally is one of the few 'checkpoints' in your body preventing cancer.  By getting the vaccine you save can reserve an entire mechanism to ward off cancer.  Or said another way, once infected with the virus, you lose an entire mechanism to ward off cancer.

In fact, in the lab, we often mimic an HPV infection in order to 'make cancerous' an otherwise healthy cell line.  If you want to take a healthy human cell and compare it with a cancerous variety of that same cell, we will infect a portion of the healthy population with the major component of HPV.  It's bad stuff. Get vaccinated."

7140,"EVERYONE SHOULD BE VACCINATED. Sorry, just wanted to get your attention. To begin, I am a pathologist who trained under one of the huge guru pathologists who has participated in several international clinical trials regarding both major HPV vaccines. (Pathologists read Pap smears; thus we follow this stuff as closely as the OB/GYNs) 

1.  While it is best to get vaccinated before so-called ""sexual debut"" getting the vaccine later still prevents you from SUBSEQUENT infections. Meaning if you've already had a sexual partner (or more!) you may have contracted and cleared a strain of HPV. However you could still contract another strain at any time in the future you decide to have sex. So the vaccine prevents complications from that later infection. 

2. Boys, girls, men, and women should and MUST get the vaccine. Why? Herd immunity.  The same reason there are regular pertussis outbreaks: non-boosted adults become carriers and spread the virus to non-vaccinated children. If we only vaccinate half the population it simply doesn't work on a population level. Unfortunately the US is a perfect example of this right now. Vaccination rates are so low that we can see a marked decrease in vaccine efficacy here compared to countries where HPV vaccination is mandated.

See, vaccines are good things. I grew up on stories from my mother about when she was a little girl and the polio vaccine was invented. He entire town had to turn out to receive it en masse. She grew up with friends who either got polio and died or lived in those iron lungs or whatever - sounded pretty gd gruesome. Growing up I only knew one guy with polio, he was from the phillipines and I guess that meant he didn't get vaccinated? He had to wear leg braces, his legs were shriveled and unusable. 

Oh yeah and my mom died of cancer, just not cervical cancer. So when I heard HPV can cause cervical cancer AND there was a vaccine for it? My kids are lucky I didn't just dart them with the vaccine the next time I saw them.

7177,"The [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/genital-warts.htm) states that you don't have to tell a partner once you've cleared up because there's no indication that they benefit from the knowledge once you're cleared. 

Also: having HPV warts is not the end of your sex life. Tell partners for sure until you clear up (and encourage everyone you know to get the vaccine) but anyone who makes you feel bad for having it is a shithole who doesn't deserve to have sex with you. (Politely declining doesn't make them a shithole.)"
7178,"At 18, hopefully most of the girls you will potentially have sex with have been vaccinated. Tell your partners (it's the right thing to do), but also remind them that there is a vaccine they likely can get or have already gotten. 

Also, the type of hpv that generally causes warts, is not the same as the one that causes cancer generally.

>[The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types of HPV that can cause cancers.](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm)

So it's not like any girls you have sex with need worry about getting cervical cancer from the type of hpv you are infected with (likely). Also, just try to be aware of when/if you are having an outbreak and avoid sex during those times. It's very likely your immune system will eventually 'beat' the virus and get rid of any symptoms. So you'll likely be able to tell a potential partner 'i haven't had a symptom in x years, though I do carry the virus'. So even if they aren't vaccinated, the chances of them getting it are unlikely and even less likely that they'll get the type that could cause cancer.

In short, at your age the girls will likely be vaccinated, but still tell them (ethics) and also tell them why it's not such a scary thing."

7212,I'm glad I'm not the only one. I found it hard to believe that the vaccine caused genital warts.
7213,"You have my complete sympathies for your diagnosis and I hope you recover swiftly. 

Essentially, HPV is NOT the sole cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer can develop like any other via mutation, HPV just increases the likelihood of it."
7214,"There are many strains of HPV beyond the ones that the vaccine covers. The vaccine covers the major cancer causers, but there are other strains that can also cause cancer that aren't prevented by the vaccine."
7215,"Cervical cancer is MOSTLY caused by HPV (we believe) but not all. Unfortunately despite the vaccine you still had cervical cancer, hopefully you've been completely treated and are doing well. Every time we get vaccinated there is a chance it won't take for some reason and we can still get the infection. This is why it is so damn important to give to everyone so we can get what is called herd immunity, so it protects everyone (those that refuse and those that it doesn't ""take"").

"
7216,"Well, two things.  First, the vaccine protects against 2 of the 4 *known* strains that are associated with cervical cancer.  Second, you can get cervical cancer without ever having been exposed to HPV.

But you are correct in that for any vaccination, there is a small number of people who have no response.  That's why for things like pertussis, polio, smallpox, etc., we rely on herd immunity.

I don't know if there are any genetic markers correlated with cervical cancer the way there are with breast cancer."
7217,"Many strains of HPV, Gardasil covers strains 6, 11, 16 and 18.  Strains 6 and 11 cause 90% of genital warts.  Strains 16 and 18 cause 70% of cervical cancer.  You happened to get one of the other strains that cause 30% of the cancers."
7218,"HPV is a vaccine for a virus while, when contracted, has a high probability of inducing cervical cancer. Cancer itself is not vaccinated against. 

Getting cervical cancer even after getting the vaccine has a large genetic component - if you are ~~decent~~ deficient in genes that prevent cancer from forming. If you are interested in learning more, they are called TNFs - tumor necrosis factor. This is just one family of many cytokines that contribute to cancer prevention. 

In other words, your genetics determine your baseline probability to develop cancer at some point in your life but the HPV vaccine will decrease that probably by a fixed amount by reducing your body's exposure to the virus that causes one specific cancer. Even with the vaccine, it's entirely possible to develop cervical cancer anyway. "
7219,"Vaccines are not 100%.  They lower your chances of getting the cancer, but don't completely protect you.  Just like how not smoking lowers your chances of lung cancer, but plenty of people who've never smoked still get lung cancer.  There is no cure-all for any cancer."
7220,"HPV causes cervical cancer, but it's not the case that all cervical cancers come from HPV."

PS: you're stunning! And I'll have to try your recipe I cook a lot of italian dishes."
7225,"No vaccine is perfectly safe for everyone. This is one of the things that is not discussed by the anti-vaccination people or the vaccination people. The essence is that some people will be severely harmed by some vaccines but the overall health benefit to society is so overwhelming that this is considered an acceptable price to pay. Of course, the odds of these adverse reactions are so low compared to the benefits of most vaccinations that the risk-reward assessment is absurdly in favor of vaccination."

"
7229,"It's actually 2 types of hpv that cause warts, and 2 kinds that cause cancer. 

This is for the hpv4, not the hpv2. There are 2 types of vaccines last time I checked. No one gives the hpv2 tho. That kind is only indicated for females, where as the hpv4 is for both males and females. It just makes more sense for clinics to just carry the hpv4.

[According to this data](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/579869) sourced from two journal articles, vaccination of 12 year old girls is $43.6k/QALY.  For 13-18 year old girls, its $97.3k/QALY (possibly too expensive).  It is ridiculously expensive for those over 18 though.  $150k+/QALY.  that should not be covered by the government or the majority of private insurance plans."

My recommendation is that you get the vaccine. It's NOT going to harm you. But it might block one of the subtypes. Maybe if you've had dozens of partners and are in your 50's, OK, it's a waste of money. But in your 30's? Why not. 

BTW, it's not contraindicated, so at least in the USA, doctors are legally allowed to give you the vaccine at your request. However, insurance companies may not cover it, and it's a fairly expensive vaccine. 

Don't take this as medical advice. Just logic."
7291,"Well, the vaccine has only been out 8 years (in the USA). So we have 8 year data, but honestly, that's a lame strawman argument. Gardasil prevents HPV. HPV causes cancer. What are we looking for? Whether it perfectly prevents all HPV, well that's an Appeal to Perfection, that is not appropriate. Maybe we'll discover that you need a booster at year 20. That's what science is going to do. But we're not going to find that because you get the vaccine (and both of you should get it, and if your girlfriend refuses, you really should), something is going to fall off of you. It's safe.

>Texas tried to ban HPV vaccine for young folks.  

I think what you mean is a significant number of Texans tried to keep the vaccine from being mandatory, not ban it completely. Some of them fell into the religious category. Some were misinformed and believed the vaccine had serious adverse side effects. Others were upset that Perry mandated it rather than let the State Congress pass it. (Congress quickly overturned the mandate anyway.)  

At the time Perry's former chief of staff Mike Toomey was a lobbyist for the Merck, the company that manufacturers the vaccine. So another group of people were against the mandate because they felt it was crony capitalism as it financially benefited Perry and his supporters.

7300,"probably... no. I only have basic knowledge of vaccines, but I think it basically means that the immune system is 'trained' by a vaccine so that it can kill/get rid off a specific disease that enters your body later on.  If that's not too simplified, it means the virus will not survive in vaccined people's bodies, so they can't be silent carriers. Most adult unvaccined people already are silent carryers, mainly because a lot of strains of the virus don't show symptoms in the first place. And some strains cause cervical cancer in women but obviously can't in men, (but they can still cause oral/colon cancer I believe) so a lot of men are silent carriers too.

The good thing is that if many people are vaccinated, there will be less carriers so the disease will also spread less to people who are not vaccinated (herd immunity, when so many people are immune that a disease can't really spread anymore even though a part of the population is still not immune)"
7301,">Does this make these women silent carriers now? Like they can still infect others but show no signs of the disease?

No. Women who receive quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) are immune to HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18. When they encounter it, they do not become infected and are not carriers. 

On the other hand, both men and women who are not vaccinated can be silent carriers of all four strains of HPV, showing no symptoms but effectively transmitting the virus to sexual partners. Especially true for men regarding strains 16 and 18 which cause cervical cancer. However research has begun to show that these two strains can lead to other forms of cancer in men such as penile and throat cancer later in life. 

"
7302,No. Genital warts develop fairly quickly after infection with HPV. This drop means a proportion of women have avoided infection with HPV 6 or 11 because of the vaccine.
7303,They controlled with other STIs. The rate of other STIs went up while the rate of genital warts went down which indicates that it's most likely not just awareness and people being more careful.
7304,They do. 
7305,Not possible without a pre-existing condition that has nothing to do with the vaccine. 
7306,What do you mean? And have you had both? 
7307,Can I ask why you say HPV is the worst disease there is?
7308,"You mean, there wasn't a correlated reduction in those that weren't eligible for the vaccine? Fuck me sideways! The vaccine is ineffective! "
7309,The vaccines that are given to women/girls (Guardasil) is the same one that boys/guys can receive. Anything saying that there is a difference or that only females can get the HPV vaccine is a myth. 
7310,"If you're in the age range for the vaccine you should probably get it anyways, it can prevent oral cancer and (if you're not straight and are the receptive partner) colon cancer."
7311,"The HPV/warts leads to cervical cancer.  in men It's not as important so the stats on it don't matter, but we can assume that since the women are carrying less, that men are getting and spreading it less."
7312,"No evidence of that yet. The clinical trials measured incidence of cancers (actually, precancerous lesions) regardless of cause. Both the vaccines significantly reduce that endpoint. If the vaccines were giving space for another type to become aggressive, that overall rate wouldn't be reduced. In fact some of the other HPV types are genetically similar to 16 or 18 so if anything there is reason to think it may help those other types too (at least the similar ones)."

7322,"I thought the statistics were the opposite: 75-80% of all adults have HPV. I read that statistic a few years ago, but I think I'd better check again because perhaps it's changed now.

*Edited to say that I found the stat: ""It is estimated that as many as 75 percent of the reproductive-age population has been infected with one or more types of genital HPV and up to 5.5 million new infections occur each year. The good news: In the vast majority of cases, the virus causes no symptoms or health problems.""
From: http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/hpv-information"
7323,"Those are symptomatic infections. The rest are only estimates because men aren't even tested. Even women are only tested for high-risk strains, only on their cervix, and usually only if they do present with symptoms. "
7324,"This advice doesn't work for HPV. 

HPV can stay dormant for a decade. "
7325,"HPV is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact in the general genital area, so condoms are often not sufficient. Transmission is most often between people who do not have any visible symptoms and are unaware they are infected. 

There is currently no test to tell if a man has HPV, unless he currently has an outbreak of genital warts. If he is carrying a strain that doesn't cause warts, or is between outbreaks, it is undetectable. In a woman, it is detectable by a pap smear only if it has caused cell abnormalities in the cervix, or if it is a strain that causes warts and she has a current outbreak. 

In other words, knowing someone's sexual history and using protection is still pretty unlikely to protect you completely from HPV. That's why this vaccine is a huge help in preventing the spread of the strains of the virus most likely to cause warts and cancer. "
7326,61% drop in female cases of genital warts due to the free HPV vaccine.
7327,"You realize that you are propagating erroneous information that will (not on this site, but somewhere) lead to people not getting vaccinated?

Please, continue to display your complete and utter ignorance to the world. Fingers crossed, you never fornicate or reproduce and pass on your poor judgment to other human beings. "

Depending on your age, sex and where you live, your government may provide it for free. (For example, Canadian women who are in middle school or high school can get it at no cost)."
7340,"I had the vaccine done when I was 19, I went to a clinic specifically for vaccinations and just walked in and asked the lady at the front desk about it. Had to go 3 times over a period of months, wasn't too bad. "

I'd think those mini clinics in Target and other stores would also offer them (maybe some of the pharmacies as well, although I'd call to check).  "
7342,"The vaccine is administered via 3 shots.  I don't think my insurance covered much of the cost, so I had to pay over $100 per shot.  The shots are also pretty painful--closer to tetanus shot soreness than flu shot soreness.  

But I won't get genital warts, cervical cancer, anal cancer, mouth cancer, or throat cancer from HPV!  (HPV infects endothelial cells that line a lot of your mucosal membranes, and all those sites are targets for HPV for both genders.  I believe cervical cancer is more discussed because the tumors are less likely to be detected early because we don't have neurons on the cervix to notice a large lump. "
7343,"It's a 3 part vaccine, 0 months, 1 month and 6 months.  It also has to remain refrigerated, so unless your doctor has it on hand, they'll have to get the pharmacist to order it.  You also need someone to administer it to you.  Your doctor can do this or you can get this done at a clinic."

7345,"Freezing off the warts is aesthetic and does not clear up the virus.  I would still encourage individuals who know they have or have had HPV to disclose to current and future partners.

7364,"I'm a year into treatment. I've done freezing (failed), acid (works much better) and laser (by far the best, but expensive). I got tested for HIV because the doctor couldn't figure out why my immune system wasn't taking care of them. Turns out I have a very persistent strain"
7365,"Why? Genital warts are very common, almost everyone gets HPV at least once in their their life, not everyone develops warts. It's just an annoying skin condition nothing more. "

However there was never any reason why the vaccine would be bad to take if you have had sex, at worst it would do nothing."
7372,[removed]
7373,"Totally fine to get it after you've had sex.  They recommend early vaccinations so to get you before you risk exposure. Some doctors might feel it's unnecessary after a certain age for 2 reasons: 1 they might assume you'll have a reduction in sexual partners and 2 with genital warts I think your body can develop an immunity after you've had them and had them treated.

Thing is, these things can remain dormant for long periods of time and to top it off, you can't be 100% sure you're clear of it after exposure.

If you want the vaccine, go get it.  If your doctor is like ""naaaaaaaah"" go to another clinic."

7375,"You can read the indications here:

http://www.merck.com/product/usa/pi_circulars/g/gardasil/gardasil_pi.pdf

I doubt it will say anything like that. The main thing is that it is only indicated for women aged between 9 and 26 years. It has not been proven to be beneficial to women over 26 years old. Also it is contraindicated in for those with known hypersensitivity (allergy) to yeast. It is also not recommended in pregnant women or immunocomprimised individuals. "
7376,"False.  The manufacturers an only legally claim efficacy on the population that they tested, women between the ages of 14 (I think) and 28, who got the vaccine prior to sexual contact.  That doesn't mean its non-efficacious for anyone outside that range, t just means they didn't test it, so they can't know, so they can't claim it.  My doctor gave it to me when I was 32, and sexually active, and other doctors are giving it to teenage boys even though they weren't part of the studied population.  The one stipulation I'll give there is that because they can't claim efficacy, your insurance might not pay for it if you're not in the population because it will be considered an ""off label"" use of the drug.  Mine did without question though, it probably just depends on your policy.  Either way, the retail price tag is $330 for the total of three injections, excluding the injection fee."
7377,That is a lie.
7378,"I've worked in an OB/Gyn in the US for 5 years and I have NEVER heard that. I've even had doctors recommend it to patients who have tested positive for HPV, but not necessarily for the strains the vaccination protects against. Since the patient has obviously already participated in ""risky sexual behavior"" it puts then more at risk for other strains of the virus."
7379,"It's recommended to people before they have sex, so that they can never possibly get HPV.  It is not *only* recommended for people who haven't had sex."
7380,"So, this advice comes from the fact that the vaccine doesn't help you if you already have any of the strains it prevents against. If you've already had sex, it means you may have already had exposure, since these strains are relatively common. The crucial caveat is that getting the vaccine doesn't hurt at all, and usually people don't know if they have HPV or not, let alone which strains. I'm not an expert on medical billing, but it might be cheaper to just get the vaccine rather than spend money on HPV strain tests and then see if you need it or not. "

7384,So there's a pro to still being a virgin at 17?
7385,I got it after having sex. Nothing bad so far
7386,It's recommended in the sense as it'll be most beneficial to virgins who haven't been exposed to the virus yet but it's still great for those who have had sex and may have been exposed as it will still protect against strains you haven't gotten. 
7387,"The HPV vaccine is prophylactic meaning that it is used to prevent the disease rather than cure it if you already have it. The vaccine is made of the HPV L1 protein which can self assemble into virion like particles. Basically it is an empty shell of the virus (no DNA inside so it cannot replicate) which causes an immune response to the L1 protein/virion like particle. So to answer your question, it is generally suggested that children/teens get the vaccine before they become sexually active, as that is the most common form of transmission of HPV. "
7388,Maybe because chances are you already have hpv if you have sex?
7389,"that's a crock, nothing to do with virginity. "
7390,"No, this vaccine covers 4 strains of the virus. Even if you have one of them, you should still get it to cover the others.

The 4 that are covered are the most common, but there are others. I suspect in the next 5 years, the other strains will become more common and we will get updated vaccines."
7391,It is recommended for people who have had sex as well. Even if you have genital warts it is still of benefit because you are likely only infected with 1 strain and so you will be protected from future infections of the other strains including those that cause cervical cancer. 
7392,"It is supposed to be most effective if taken before you have sex. Otherwise, if you've had sex and been exposed, it's not going to do much for you"
7393,you can get it up to a certain age. after that it's not effective. sex or no sex

7397,"Yes, it's true. It's not a therapeutical vaccine. HPV is very common, spreads easily and low-risk strains are not tested for in everyday health care because they're harmless. So once someone has had sex, there's no way to tell whether they're infected with those two strains or not. If they are, the vaccine is useless. In case you want to get it anyway and take your chances, it's OK. I got it after developing warts because of an unsupported claim that it'll help prevent future outbreaks and I'm fine.

So glad I got the vaccine!"
7419,Was the reaction as bad as cancer?
7420,"Yes, as it prevents against you being a carrier and transmitting the disease to girls. Also: Throat cancer in men. See Peter Kent.

No: Because the cost is ridiculous. I was told $700 by my doctor, not covered by my insurance (yay America!) [This site has it at around $500](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancercauses/othercarcinogens/infectiousagents/hpv/humanpapillomavirusandhpvvaccinesfaq/hpv-faq-vaccine-cost)"

7423,Yes! I got it in my 20s. It's just three simple shots.

Interesting to note though, guidelines have changed for PAPs recently. Individuals ages 21 to 65 with history of negative PAP smears are not required to obtain yearly PAPs, rather every 3 years with normal annual pelvic exam. Chlamydia and Gonorrhea testing is recommended at yearly exams up to age 25.    "
7440,"Guy here, just got my first dose. It is completely possible for men to contract the disease, but there are often no symptoms other than rash/warts/occasional stinging sensations. The more important reason for men to get it is to protect any future female partners.

Talk to your doctor about it. It's usually recommended for men 26 and younger, but iirc, ""men who have sex with men"" (that's Gardasil's wording, not mine. I would've just said gay) have a higher likelihood of either contracting the disease, or transferring it to their partner. I can't remember which."
7441,I think the your student health center can probably point you in the best direction - likely Planned Parenthood or a local GYN. Good for you for educating yourself on the importance of the vaccine!!
7442,"""there is no evidence to link CFS to the HPV vaccine"" ...."
7443,Well both are important. There are many different strains of HPV and at any given time anyone could be infected with a strain. In normal healthy individuals this will resolve over time. Within one year your PAP could show both HPV + and subsequently HPV- without specific treatment due to your ability to fight it off. Studies have shown though that smoking is a major cause of resistant HPV.

You're the only one in this thread who's actually cited the CDC's findings as to where many others are using older or common research of ""well, once you have it, you have it forever.""  Not entirely true, most people clear the virus in a maximum of 3 years (usually takes about 4-5 months after final treatment).  Treatment itself does not clear the virus but for many, the reason the virus stays in your skin and continues to grow as a wart is because your immune system hasn't been notified of the viral load's presence.  It isn't smart enough to tell the difference between normal genital skin cells from infected genital skin cells.  

Once cryo, laser, podofilox, aldara or other treatments are used and the skin is attacked, the immune system sweeps in in the surrounding area to ""keep guard"" as the damaged skin repairs itself.  Maybe not the first, second, third or fourth time, but once the immune system finally catches the ""scent"" of the infected cells, it can spread the word to the rest of the immune system and finally begin actually clearing the virus.   This is why one must be persistent with their treatment over and over again until the warts stop coming back for good.

The thing is, even after clearing the virus, your immune system does not retain said immunity for that viral DNA forever.  You can catch the virus again (same strain or a new one or multiple strains) given how prevalent the virus itself is.  IIRC, the chances of being exposed to HPV (not just HPV that causes warts but all HPV) is 1/2 amongst sexually active adults now in the US (many of whom are probably asymptomatic).  

With vaccines like Gardisil out there now, I think the negative stigma surrounding HPV and warts will begin to subside.    "

Unfortunately that is a bigger deal than it seems.

Had this study shown that after giving the vaccine there was a 61% increase in HPV infections it would likely not have been published. 

The trouble is that it muddies the waters, the design of this study seems fine, all the science seems copacetic but do we know about the other studies that didn't show positive results for Gardasil?

As an individual, if everybody gets vaccinated except for me, I would stand to enjoy all the benefits of a vaccinated society without having to assume any of the risks associated with vaccines. (I am not sure what the vaccine rate would have be before this is no longer true.)

The known risks are rare, but real. The DTaP vaccine for example, causes 1 in 14,000 children to have seizures and 1 in 16,000 to have very high temperatures (over 105). 

Over the last 30 years, approximately 3700 families have been compensated for vaccine related injuries, and about half of those suffered brain damage. "
7487,"Yes. My brother suffered from seizures as a result of his vaccines in elementary school. The doctors linked it to an allergy, though they wanted to diagnose him as epileptic. My parents fought against that, it sure as hell wasn't epilepsy.

I still plan on getting the vaccines i need to leave the country, and I'm looking to get the HPV vaccine asap. I plan on fully vaccinating my kids. 

Something people seem to confuse is that, just because I'm not vaccinated, doesn't mean I'm anti vaccines. I can't for medical reasons. Like you said, some people just can't get vaccinated. And that's ok, because that's what herd immunity is for (for the most part). "

 But the vaccines have been marketed towards girls and most government programs have focused on vaccinating girls of a specific age group.  This is because women are disproportionately affected by HPV.

7525,"> If the vaccines were giving space for another type to become aggressive, that overall rate wouldn't be reduced.

Yes, it would - I'm referring to the hypothesis that overall incidence would be reduced, but the resulting cancers would be less treatable. I saw the hypothesis several times around the time of the introduction of the vaccine - and no, not by antivaxxers - but never saw any results or conclusion regarding the hypothesis.

The reason for the hypothesis was that it was allegedly already known that the other HPV subtypes are responsible for other cancers that would be even more concerning than the ones caused by HPV 6/11/16/18. I'm not an expert in this stuff though, so don't take my word for it. I just wanted to clarify that what I quoted from your post has nothing to do with the hypothesis I mentioned, seeing as I specifically am *not* talking about the somewhat similar subtypes 6/11/16/18 which are indeed all covered by the vaccine (albeit to various degrees of success IIRC)."

You would definitely want to let future partners know; the virus can still spread even if you're symptom-free. Virtually everyone has HPV but most strains are harmless.  I know all this because I did a TON of research when I went in for my annual pap exam and they found pre-cancerous cells in my cervix from HPV (even though I did all 3 rounds of the shot about 5 years ago!).  Luckily my body shed the virus/cells and I'm healthy now but that 12 months of waiting until my next exam was just awful.  Best of luck to you!

7556,Strains that cause warts do not cause cervical cancer. I think its pretty much impossible to know if a guy has the stain that causes cancer. However women can be vaccinated against it now. 
7557,"I thought we were talking about warts here. Also, the main reason why women get cervical cancer is not HPV on its own. It's a weak immune system and not attending regular screenings. As someone who got vaccinated after developing symptoms, I'm definitely not advocating against the vaccine but not everybody can afford it. "
7558,"They are extremely rarely caused by high-risk strains. 99 percent of them are caused by low-risk strains, meaning they're benign. Itching? Yes, in some individuals, they itch when they start growing. So do mosquito bites. Doesn't mean they are a risk to one's health. You like fearmongering, don't you?"
7559,Extremely rarely. And you know it. Is fearmongering really necessary? You are more likely to get hit by a car on the street than get Bowenoid warts or give a newborn Laryngeal papillomatosis. 
7560,"What you're talking about are not warts. Warts are extremely rarely cancerous. What you have in mind are different strains of HPV, called high-risk, that prefer mucous membranes. "
7561,so why do many reputable sources say your body clears the virus in 2 years?
7562,Most people clear the virus eventually. Only a small minority have it for life.
7563,"Well, it prevents against three strains. FYI, there are types of warts it doesn't protect against, those are the types least likely to cause cancer. So you might not have even had one of the thee cancer causing types."
7564,"Not the most likely thing to happen, but I guess..."

7567,"Following up: I talked with the woman I'm seeing about it and it went great! 

I told her considering we were moving towards sex soon we should talk about it. I asked when she was last tested. Then I told her when I was and that I have non-cervical cancer causing HPV. I then told her the facts..most sexually active people get it, last time I had symptoms, etc. Also pointed out that it is so common most doctors don't even recommend disclosing about it, but I wanted to be honest and build a foundation of trust. She was very accepting, thankful, and I feel we have grown closer because of it.

Just thought I'd share (: best of luck"
7568,It definitely depends whether it's a one night stand or something special. But even if it's something special the moment that sex initiates is usually filled with body language and not words. Just remember condom. It eliminates risk which is the most important thing here. And stay cool man
7569,Hoes don't get the shot soooo these hoes aint loyal and dirty
7570,Still got it from some unloyal harlot
7571,"Sorry to hear that, man. Keep at it. On a side note, I bought a freezing kit and froze them off myself. I wouldn't recommend it for the average person, due to the risk, but it worked well for me. "
7572,Skin condition?   What are signs besides warts?
7573,"What?  I thought it was incurable?  I was told the only treatment is through a doctor, I don't know what that treatment is or its effectiveness, but I do know it may be a very long time before I can afford to see a doctor again. Trying to get better with Spanish so maybe I can go see a doctor in Mexico eventually.

7580,"Except for the cost :/ I'm a guy and when I was first 'able' to get it (ie my doc was giving it to males) it would have cost around 1k overall. And as a college kid, that's not really something I can just pony up for."

7582,"Not sure if you are from outside the US, but the US vaccination schedules come from the CDC and they have never had a ""only virgins"" recommendation."
7583,"Weird, in the UK every girl gets the HPV vaccine at the age of about 13. Is it really optional in the US?"
7584,As someone who had HPV it was recommended to get it because I was in a sexually active relationship. Wound up getting the vaccine so I could be protected against the other strands. Of course I had the cancerous and warts strand. Thank god for science and medicine because I wouldn't be where I am today. 
7585,"Also, if you take it and have have HPV, it might increase your chances of cervical cancer iirc"
7586,[removed]
7587,"You're mistaken, and any woman (24 +) who came of age when this vaccine first hit the market will tell you so. You see, if you've had sex, or even so much as have had reached 3rd base, there is a 90 +% chance that you have some strain of HPV. It was actually VERY common when pediatricians/ general physicians started administering this vaccine to disclose to young women that it might not be worth getting the shot if they have already had sex/ engaged in sexual activity. I.E.A girl's answer to the ""are you sexually active?"" question often was determinative of whether or not the doctor would recommend the vaccine to her. I remember my friends and I all freaking out (we were 17 at the time, and newly sexual active) when we all had our Junior year physicals because we knew that our mom's would ask us why we didn't get the shot haha. I guess they still recommend it regardless of sexual activity now on the off chance that you didn't contract a strain the vaccine covers. Still though, not entirely untrue that doctors once recommended against the vaccine if you were already sexually active. "
7588,It's not. 
7589,"Yeah, there's a lot to be said for getting fewer genital warts and cancers."
7590,"In this case, the information is correct."
7591,"Ah bummer, I'm 28. "
7592,"> It has not been proven to be beneficial to women over 26 years old.

Better to say, women over 26 weren't included in clinical trials. The vaccine doesn't necessarily stop being effective at that age."
7593,"No, it's not."
7594,Yes exactly. I had HPV and still got the vaccine so I was covered from the other strands. 
7595,"You can still get HPV since the vaccine only protects against certain strains. However, it is worth it to get the shots. The cost of treating cervical cancer or even getting PAP smears every few months due to suspect results is significant for a woman."

7598,"How old are you? I'm 24 and just got 3 shots for the HPV vaccine approved for men last year, up to age 26 it can be recommended depending on risk factors. Being a gay man was my risk factor, but if you claimed a lot of promiscuous sex maybe it could be recommended as well?"
7599,"You realize HPV is (as far as I know) the only viral STD that you don't have for life right? Your immune system gets rid of it usually in 2-5 years. 5 years ago I got HPV in the beginning of college, and it went away after a couple years."
7600,"My mother prevented me from getting this when I was young.  She said Christian girls didn't need it.  

I regret letting her decide that for me."
7601,I am in the same boat. Except I actually asked my doctor about the vaccine before I got warts and he told me not to bother because it wasn't recommended (for boys/warts) at the time. Big mistake :(
7602,That sucks... I feel lucky enough to be born in this time span
7603,I'm with ya pal
7604,"If you haven't showed any symptoms get tested. I was tested at 48, for all STDs because I made the mistake of getting involved with somebody who was promiscuous to say the least, and just before my 49th birthday birthday I was pronounced free and clear of all STDs and got my HPV vaccine.  "
7605,why?
7606,"The pertussis vaccine isn't enduring anyway.  You have to get boosters of it. (Which, I assume, is one of the reasons it's bundled with the tetanus shot in the TDAP)"
7607,The vaccine provides partial protection against at least 12 other strains.
7608,"ON top of that, many (many) women of a certain age who have had sex with more than one person will test positive for HPV but will not have signs or symptoms of warts. It freaks a lot of women out, thinking they're going to get cervical cancer because of the commercials for these vaccines saying flat out, ""This vaccine is for cervical cancer"".

 I tested positive for HPV 8 years ago, never showed symptoms of anything and tested negative again several times since then. I wish people knew where to get good information on these normal body function issues. "
7609,"In Australia though, general warts rates have dropped dramatically. They vaccine both girls and boys"

7614,That's definitely not true. The general public haven't been given the polio vaccine for decades and it's not because of anti-vaxxers. Maybe you're thinking of the host of other diseases that should be vaccinated against like measles mumps rubela and whooping cough.
7615,[removed]
7616,"Maybe not. The polio vaccine hasn't been a standard vaccine in the US for a few decades if I remember correctly. Diseases like mumps, measles and whooping cough though are the ones that seem to be making a comeback."
7617,"Can you explain how it is coming back if so many people are vaccinated against it? I understand people who don't have the vaccine could acquire it, but you saying ""Polio is coming back"" doesn't make sense."
7618,"The only countries with endemic polio left are Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria. "
7619,"It's not coming back anymore than polyester leisure suits. Yeah they exist, but it's no Ebola. "
7620,"Polio doesn't exist in the first world because of vaccination and first world living.

Polio exists in the third world because of lack of vaccination and interruption of vaccination programs.

Where you have a lack of refrigeration, the injection/shot/jab can't be used. The oral polio vaccine is used instead. The oral polio vaccine is a live vaccine that is shed in faeces. Where you have civilian upheaval in partially vaccinated populations, polio can spread through vaccination and lack thereof plus lack of sanitation.

7623,"Not sure of this is the reaction that the above person is talking about, but some people can get seizures from the vaccine, therefore it's recommended that all recipients wait 15 minutes after the vaccine before leaving the office to make sure they don't have a seizure from the vaccine and don't get proper treatment."
7624,"I got the shots when I was in high school around when they first came out.  About 10 minutes after the first shot I broke out into cold sweats and blacked out. For the next two shots the doctors wouldn't let me out of the office for at least 30 minutes after the shots. Some people have  seizures and supposedly a couple of people have slipped into comas afterwards. I've also been reading that a lot of people develop chronic migraines after the shots. I have no idea how much is actually linked to the shots (or even true) or not. I still recommend most people get them but there have been various reactions. Like any sort of medication/shot, just keep an eye on things because you never know if you'll have a bad reaction."
7625,Example: I just got the vaccine this year and it made me pass out. It had me foaming at the mouth. Totally worth it though.
7626,"Only reaction I got was an *extremely* sore arm in the following days after each shot. My arm (mostly in the region where the shot was injected) felt like I had done a 24-hour non-stop boxing session and it hurt to even just let it hang down. Other than that, I had no symptoms. I would recommend getting the shot in the arm you normally use less (your less-dominant hand).

EDIT: Apparently people recommend getting the shot *in* your dominant arm because it's best to keep your arm moving, but to be honest, the pain was too much for me and I'd rather not ruin my good arm for those days. So really it's up to the patient. "
7627,I also had the series shortly after it came out as did many of my friends/classmates.  It was known to be a more painful vaccine to receive than most and I definitely felt that way when I got it.  Luckily that was my biggest issue with it. 
7628,She was probably just embarrassed.
7629,"My guess based on the latest scientific evidence would be that, after getting the vaccine, that daughter contracted Giantslutitus.  It occurs in approximately 3000% of HPV vaccine recipients."
7630,"/u/Natryn did say *this vaccine* specifically.  A few people do have bad reactions to Gardasil, just as they can have to any vaccine.  The good that these vaccines can do far outstrips any short-term reactions people may have to them though.

Said mom should be more careful about thinking that her daughter having a bad reaction means everyone will, however.  The worst I got from Gardasil is bruising at the injection site. "
7631,16 was too young for the measles vaccine...?  
7632,"Agreed - if you think vaccines can hurt you, you hate science.  Hail Science! Down with the non-Believers!"

7635,"I know right?  And I love going down on gf's in the past but this has always been a fear of mine.  At 30 (I think 'or male'), I'm not elligible because I wasn't part of the group they tested on (women age something up to 28).  Because they can't guarantee the results without a sample, they don't promote it for anything other than the test group.  And thus the insurance won't pay for something the manufacture isn't promoting it for, even though there's no reason for it to nor be effective."
7636,"My state's Medicaid covers it 100%, reminds me that I need to get my second shot. "
7637,"I just got all three shots for free from my primary care doc. It is considered preventative care, so it should be free for everyone. Check again."
7638,"Good to know, thanks!

Do any Ontarians know if this vaccine is covered under OHIP?

Edit: Nevermind.. 

>The HPV vaccine is approved for males up to 26 years old. Right now, the HPV vaccine isn’t offered free of charge to boys through a school program, but they can buy it with a prescription from their doctor. 

---
>Individuals who are not eligible for the publicly funded vaccine or who do not wish to receive the vaccine in a school based clinic are able to access the vaccine through their family physicians for a fee. The cost of the vaccine is not covered by OHIP. Only the doctor’s fee to give the injection is covered by OHIP. Costs may vary and are estimated to be approximately $150 per dose; $450 for all three doses. Many private insurance companies are covering the cost of the vaccine. Individuals should confirm with their insurer prior to purchasing the vaccine from the pharmacy to determine amount of coverage, if any. "
7639,"Yea, I got mine for free. I was 25. 

Made me feel funny for like 6 hours and then I was fine. Pretty cool shit and I'm glad to be (hopefully) immune to most forms of HPV."

Plus the source of the studies was the AU gov't. And it was reviewed by an ethics board. To fudge the results I would think of something this massive would require getting say the numbers of 2-4 million patient encounters and only publishing 1.2 of the desired results. Which I would like to think is something that the other scientists in the study and the ethics board would cry foul about. "
7674,"While I agree in that non-publication bias is an issue in general, it's not relevant in this paper, because it was published. 

Part of this problem comes from the public/media. 10 studies are conducted, 6 with positive results, 3 with non-significant differences, and 1 that give an atheoretical example of a case in which the vaccines raised the incidence of the disease. A simple meta-analysis of all the relevant studies will support the case for the program or the vaccine.

7677,"Exactly. At the very least the data of failed/unpublished studies should be made available for inquiry. The complete data should be made available for published studies as well. If certain data sets are omitted for various reasons (as they often are) that information should be made available for closer inspection. Data is often omitted for valid reasons, but its not unheard of  for data to be omitted so the researchers can achieve a specific conclusion. I'm not inferring anything specific about this study, I just can't help play devil's advocate when it comes to Pharma patting themselves on the back. The raw data doesn't seem to be available for this study... nothing abnormal about that. I just fail to understand why in todays information age providing the data for public critique isn't standard protocol.

According to a Merck press release, in the second quarter of 2007, it had been approved in 80 countries,"" - so there was no preventative HPV vaccine approved before that (or the article is wrong).  There were clinical trials before that, of course, but it wasn't approved yet in 2003/2004, in Canada or anywhere else.  It was approved for use in Canada in July 2006, so far as I can tell.

Well, if you are sexual with multiple partners during lifetime, then there is a likelihood you have already been infected.  It is a common virus.  Most people do not have symptoms.  The immune system attacks the virus and eliminates the infection.  The issue is what happens after that.  Does the virus remain dormant to reactivate when immune system is compromised or does the virus remain active in some people?  Cancer is not always coming with HPV.  It is often asymptomatic."
7707,"Yes, some health insurance won't cover it. And I believe Medicaid and CHIP (state Medicaid for kids in Texas) only offer mandatory vaccines, not optional or recommended ones. "
7708,"Ah. Just wanted to make sure people didn't think there were separate ones. I always thought guys should get the HPV vaccine since guys are more likely to be transmitters of it. A lot of guys who messed around in the 70s are getting cancers (especially oral/throat cancer) from HPV they got years ago. I mean, c'mon. The less cancer the better. "
7709,"I guess that is a theoretical possibility. I'm not aware of any research comparing prognoses by HPV type: anecdotally, I've heard physicians call out type 18 as causing difficult lesions. Maybe that also applies to other types in that family not in the vaccines, like 45.

My statement was based on the endpoint used in clinical trials, high grade cervical dysplasias regardless of HPV type, within 3 or 4 years of entering the trial. What I should have said is that prevention of the types in the vaccine has not allowed other types to become more prevalent. It's not just the trials that have shown this, an NHANES study last year from the CDC also has."

7711,"I don't mean to be rude, as it seems that you've tried to defend what you're talking about. However, is there any more reliable sources that you could cite? Anti-vaccination websites do not present an unbiased, reasonable data on these sources.

Peer-reviewed journals do take up the issue of mortality. Any real source will consider the risk/reward of of vaccines like this, but in cases such as this, the risk of being one in 10,000 or 100,000 that has serious adverse effects outweighs the risk of cervical cancer."

Actual. Real. Science.

Even with sanevax's numbers, HPV vaccination is less dangerous than polio, yet prevents a horribly unnecessary death from cancer. Hmm...choices, choices."

7718,"No it isn't because HPV is so common and you can get it even if you wear a condom. You don't even need to have intercourse to get it. 

The majority of sexually active individuals have it. Something that is changing thanks to a vaccine. 

Generally speaking the body absorbs the virus. You'll have it and never know, however, there are instances where it leads to precancerous conditions or even cancer. It's all depends on the type. 


There is no way to know if someone has it if the disease is not active, you can test and test for years and nothing shows until maybe ten years later. 

Your advice just isn't practical for HPV in particular but it is good advice for other diseases. HPV doesn't really fit the bill for irresponsible sex. "

7724,"Insurance is unlikely to cover it as its not inherently clinically indicated as it would be if you were 26 or younger, but if your physician/clinician felt you were medically an appropriate candidate for it,  s/he can absolutely choose to administer it. You just may pay out of pocket. "
7725,I'm a 36 year old male and got the full three shots last year. So yes you can I just asked my GP and he gave them to me. I had to pay though and they are not cheep something like $174 each. I'm also a virgin so that probably helped. 
7726,"The vaccine loses its effectiveness the closer to 26 you get, and it is a three part process, once every two or three months.  Past the age of 26 it really has no effect at preventing HPV.  This is why it is encouraged for those around the age of puberty to get the shots.

7728,"It's a vaccination against some forms of HPV. HPV can be transferred many ways. If you've ever gotten warts from the gym shower or dorm shower floor, that's one kind of HPV (though probably not one of the ones vaccinated against). Sexual contact is the most common way to transfer it.

7736,"When I was a nurse, one of the ways we would check men for visible/near-visible infections was to soak paper towels in vinegar and have them wrap it around their penis.  After letting their penis soak in vinegar for a bit, it could show small warts (by making them turn white).  In some countries they also do this with women to identify warts on the labia and cervix, but not typically in the US -- where pap smears are typically used."

7741,"Actually it's that they don't REQUIRE women under 21 to take it, but over 21 they do. They also require it if they'll be prescribing birth control or doing an std test. It's just that they take your word for it if you're a virgin if you're under 21. Once you're 21 they think you're full of shit. "

7746,"I did try treatments, not burning, which weren't successful.  I decided to let them run their course, it took about 18 months and they all went away.  Just because they are gone, I wouldn't consider myself HPV negative, just in remission.  If I don't experience future outbreaks I would entertain that the virus may be gone, but would still disclose because there is no way to know for sure.   Does that answer your question? "

7750,"It is not fear mongering to say that they CAN cause complications. It is spreading misinformation to say something is harmless that CAN cause complications. Of the STI's out there it is one of the least harmful, but it is still an sti, and it does still have the capacity to cause harm to a person.  There is some major confirmation bias and false attribution in your statement. Car accident rates have NOTHING to do with sti complications."
7751,"For one, it's definitely still debated by reputable sources because nobody can actually assert that something is ""gone"", only that ""we can't detect anything"". Secondly, there exists no source that says ""all people can clear any strain of the virus in 2 years"". 2 years may be the *average* time in which *most* people can fight down *some* strains to an undetectable range, but what's the spread on that statistic? What percent of people carry it well over that line, or are there certain strains that can stick around for a while? I've definitely read of there existing some cases where transmission occurred more than 2 years after getting it. 

Plain and simple, the possibility of transmission makes it totally unethical to not inform future partners about having once carried it. Personally, I think there's a lot of rationalizing going on for those who are very insecure and fearful for how it affects their dating prospects, and they *want* to believe they can safely keep it a secret.

7781,Can't just say something like that without explaining how.
7782,"Not ""only recommended for people who haven't had sex yet"" but this is the targeted demographic. It's why no one gets this vaccine after age 26 --- because the virus has such a high prevalence. Preferably, the vaccine should be administered before sexual activity begins. Also of note is that oropharyngeal cancers in men caused by HPV are trending upwards and will be more common than HPV-induced cervical cancer within the next few years. "

7808,"[Maybe they're a tad over 26 years old?](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-hcp.htm)

>>HPV vaccines are licensed for females and males through age 26 years.  Vaccination would have the greatest benefit when administered to girls and boys, aged 11 or 12 years.
As in trials in younger women, a clinical trial of quadrivalent vaccine in women >26 years found the vaccine to be safe. This study also showed that the vaccine was effective in women without evidence of existing or past infection with HPV vaccine types. However, the study demonstrated limited or no protection against disease in the overall study population. Neither vaccine is licensed in the United States for use in women over the age of 26 years.  Although women over age 26 years are not recommended to receive HPV vaccination, they should have cervical cancer screening as currently recommended."

7812,"HPV doesn't mean you will definitely get cervical cancer, it just increases your likelihood.

The vaccine is for preventing cervical cancer, it does do this. But just because you get HPV doesn't mean you will get cervical cancer (just like smoking doesn't mean you will definitely get lung cancer).

Like others said downthread, make sure to get your proper checkups etc."
7813,"The types the cause warts aren't the same as the types that cause cancer and it can take 20 years or more for the cancer to develop. Even if you get a strain that causes cancer you probably won't get cancer. Also, the main purpose of the vaccine is to prevent the cervical cancer, not the warts.

Warts add texture anyway, it's like the ribbed fleshlight."
7814,"Yes, which is why the percentage of individuals who have (or have had) HPV is so high.

However, as others have posted, the virus usually disappears completely after a couple of years, and then you would not transfer the virus."

7824,"I think you're confusing polio with smallpox.

7826,"Wrong. Polio still happens in many areas of the world, and people still need to be vaccinated against, and there are ongoing vaccination campaigns in those areas, but those opposed to vaccination are stopping them. "
7827,"Actually, conservative Muslims preventing vaccines in Niger and Nigeria said the vaccine was forbidden by religion and was a trick and guess what happened? Polio is still endemic in many parts of the world, and the anti-vaxers in those places are making eradication more difficult."

Which is to say, at several ages, doses of polio vaccine are currently given to children in the US, and indeed the situation is similar in almost all countries.

Even though pretty much the entire western world (and most of the rest of the world as well) has been 100% polio free for well over a decade, there's an ongoing risk\* of reinfection from wild-type virus, so vaccinations for polio aren't going anywhere.

\* (and likely, always will be, even if the entire world goes disease-free)"
7829,"Sure, but it's also making a comeback in the mainland US, far away from those regions, because of anti-vaxxers. Armed conflicts may be stirring up the disease, but anti-vaxxers are causing it to spread and thrive."

7833,"Herd immunity works by vaccinating everyone, even though the vaccination isn't 100% effective the people that get it won't be able to spread it to others.

When small groups of people don't vaccinate and get the disease, the disease can spread very, very quickly, and mutate to make the vaccine completely useless against it. This makes the anti-vaxxer movement very, very dangerous because it's not just them that are going to get these diseases, it's damn near everyone if the anti-vaxxer group grows too large.

A vaccine only works against a very specific strain of a disease, most vaccination shots we get contain many different vaccines against many different strains of a certain disease, but covering all the bases is impossible without a lot more resources, and a hell of a lot more shots. New strains can also pop up due to mutation, making any previous vaccines useless.

Keeping people from getting a disease prevents it from mutating to a new strain, making current vaccines useful. It's a bit of a loop, that when broken gets out of control quickly."
7834,"Polio is still endemic enough in some areas to be a risk to unvaccinated children. In the US we don't even vaccinate against polio anymore. It's children in India, Pakistan, the Middle East, etc. who are at risk. "

7837,Why would people have a different reaction to this vaccine than to others?
7838,"Hmmm, interesting... I don't think they ever warned me about that when I got the shots, or ever made me wait in the office afterwards. They just warned me about the usual soreness, redness, and itchiness around the injection site.

I wonder if my doctor just sucked, or if it was because I got it very shortly after it became widely available to the public? I think I got it when I was in my sophomore year of high school, around 2008 or so."
7839,"I actually had a somewhat similar reaction! After my first shot I got up to leave my doc's office and suddenly got this black cloud looming at the edge of my vision and felt dizzy. My doctor noticed my face and blinking and got me to lay down. Luckily I didn't pass out, and I didn't react the same for the next two shots.

Honestly though, if all I have to endure is some discomfort and disorientation for a few minutes it is *so worth it* to be protected for the rest of my life against shit no one wants."

Her daughter might have had a rash for all we know. Parents can be overprotective.

I don't care if her daughter had a bad reaction, she shouldn't recommend that others avoid the vaccine because of it. Reactions happen. (Shit, have you seen a smallpox vaccine recipient?)"
7843,I think the kid got measles when he was a baby (too young for vaccine) and then when he was 16 something related to the measles cropped up (or something)
7844,"Delayed problem, he was under 1 but he could quite easily get sspe which would only turn up at 16"
7845,"I definitely will. Though my doctor was less than enthusiastic about giving the vaccine to a guy (I was actually the one who brought it up, and he kind of brushed it aside). 

According to [this CDC link](http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2010/09/The-Affordable-Care-Act-and-Immunization.html), it looks like the ACA covers the shot through the age of 19, but after that you're no longer eligible.

7850,"Canadian here, had to pay for my HPV shots, they were like $300 a pop. I think they would have been free if I'd had them in school but I was afraid of having to get a needle without my mom back then.

Also it's apparently $25 to remove a wart from your hand, according to my doc. Feet are free, hands ain't."
7851,"I suspect you pay for vaccines in lots of places, even those with government healthcare, if you are not in the group that health officials recommend for the vaccine.

But yes, in the US, the government doesn't pay for health care, so yes, theoretically you could end up paying for a vaccine. However, it's not as bad as it may sound:

* Most people have a health insurance plan. Insurers are [required](http://www.hhs.gov/healthcare/facts/factsheets/2010/09/The-Affordable-Care-Act-and-Immunization.html) to pay for certain vaccines. Even if not required, insurers are typically pretty enthusiastic about preventive care since it saves them money.
* For those who have trouble affording health insurance, there is now a subsidy plan where the government gives you money to buy insurance.
* For children, basically free healthcare is available, even if their parents can't afford to pay their health insurance, in the form of [Medicaid](http://www.medicaid.gov/). (This is also available to others, such as those who are disabled and can't work.)
* The CDC has a [Vaccines for Children](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/index.html) program that ""provides vaccines at no cost to children who might not otherwise be vaccinated because of inability to pay"".
* Generally, vaccines aren't as expensive as this one. The HPV one is called Gardasil, and since it is pretty new, as far as I know only available from Merck, which drives up the cost Typically, if you pay the full price for a vaccination, it's [$30 to $100](http://www.target.com/pharmacy/clinic-services)."

7859,I'm a 28 year old heterosexual man. Any idea why it isn't recommended for me?
7860,"> The **primary** age group recommended for vaccination according to NACI is females aged 9 to 13.

What this means is that typically a female child/teenager's gyno/Primary care physician will recommend they get the vaccine, and it likely won't be brought up to male children, which is what I would like to see change."
7861,"Yes, and I am in fact one of those people doing said research.

I appreciate trusting officials to make decisions, but there are cases where things can and should be changed"
7862,"They can *only* officially recommend it for those who fit into the same category as those in the clinical trials, which is women aged 14 - 28. There is zero expectation for it to be harmful to males or people outside of that age range, and no biological reason that the vaccine would interact differently with their body. It's just about who've they tested, and who they haven't. When weighing the risk of taking a vaccine already tested to be safe amongst a large portion of the population, versus the risk of obtaining a potentially oncogenic virus that there exists no publicly available way to test for its presence in male partners, and very limited/imperfect tests for females, I think the choice is pretty clear. "
7863,"If it wasn't, the FDA wouldn't recommend it. "
7864,"It can't be stopped. Not yet, anyway. But it can be slowly made less widespread. You have to decide for yourself. You could already be a carrier. The more partners, the more possible strains. Or you could have been lucky so far and not contracted any of the strains the vaccine protects from. Impossible to determine as of now. I already had symptoms when I got vaccinated. I took a chance. I already knew both sides of the story and decided it was worth 180 euros. You might never have health issues due to HPV without it. Or you might avoid them with it. Or you might get it but still get sick. It's up to you..."

HPV is considered the common cold of the sexual world, but I'm still not going to subject someone to that unless they plan on having a meaningful relationship with me. Otherwise, if it's a short fling, they won't want to deal with that. And I wouldn't want that on my conscious, as harmless as genital warts can be."

7882,"I stated that I thought the science is good, and it probably is. That wasn't my point. 

It's the decision to publish that is the issue in the pharma research world. By and large pharma companies don't fake research, if people believe that they are misguided, what they do is setup studies favorably for their new drug to give their new treatment every chance of producing favorable results and perhaps more importantly withholding studies that don't support their drug.

If I flipped a coin 10 times and only told you about the 5 times it came up heads you would say, ""Wow, in 100% of cases where a coin is flipped it came up heads! That gives me a lot of confidence that if I flip a coin it will come up heads."" 

That is the largest current issue with drug studies, the ability to selectively publish; these are companies who exist to produce value for their stockholders and it does not behoove their stockholders to publish studies that find no improvement over standard treatment with their new drug, so they do not publish those studies. Then when a doctor is trying to find the best medicine for his patients he is accessing a body of research that is incomplete."

The reason that I mention it is that it is relevant in every study that a company has de facto control over whether the study is published or not. In this case we got good science published, awesome, but that's just because Gardasil happens to be a good drug. I repeat that had this study cast Gardasil in a very negative light it wouldn't have been published, that's a bad thing and for this study Merck had the ability to do that. 

I agree that media portrayals of these things can cause problems."

And to be fair, there is a huge pro-vaccine bias among health care workers and researchers. Most of the health care workers I spoke to were not aware of the known risks. One could just as easily argue that many vaccine injuries are misdiagnosed because of the widespread belief in the absolute safety of vaccines. 

Likewise, were researchers to publish results that were controversial, they would be entering a political shit storm. Researchers need the freedom to make mistakes. They shouldn't have to worry about being crucified by the press if they release results that raise questions about vaccine safety. I don't think many scientists want their work paraded around by Jenny McCarthy; nor do they want their early, tentative research held up as a reason for parents to stop vaccinating children. One can easily imagine an atmosphere where scientists ""play it safe"". 

That's why I prefer to stick to the numbers as written rather than speculate about potential biases. "
7890,"sure the studies aren't hidden, but they don't tell you the dangers, and they advertise it as perfectly safe, with very rare side effects that actually weren't rare."

7892,"I got warts once. Had them removed. Oh well I was in a monogamous relationship. Probably got it from her. My mom starts nagging me about getting this vaccine because my little sister just got it. I kept telling her no, but would not dare tell her I most likely had HPV already. So I asked my doctor and he basically said it wouldn't hurt. It would protect against the other strains I didn't already carry, and that once my body cleared the virus I would be protected from future outbreaks if I came in contact with another girl who had HPV.

TLDR ask your doctor."
7893,"It's a vaccine, so I assume not."
7894,"It will work on preventing other HPV infections (assuming the person already infected just has one strain). And even then, it could potentially prevent reinfection of the same type of wart.  It's too difficult to test for such things though, as it would be unethical to ask someone to not treat a genital wart for six months (3 shots with 3 months in between IIRC).

How I see it though is that the immune system will get the antibodies it needs to prevent future infections. Skin cells that already have the virus won't benefit, but maybe the infection won't spread as much?"
7895,"Well if you only have one of the 4 strains that is in the vaccine cocktail, currently, the vaccine will prevent the other three. Unfortunately, it won't get rid of the strain you already have. "

7924,"I know that some of my religious family is very against the idea of this particular vaccine being available to young people (or at all because you shouldn't have sex outside of marriage, and both parties should lose their virginity to their spouse), its possible that there is pressure on doctors to not advertise this based on the political climate of the area. If the doc doesn't suggest it, I would still ask about it. "
7925,"Fair enough.  I'm over 30, single, and if this is something I should be getting I'll make a Dr's appointment.  "
7926,Insurance won't cover it.
7927,"Your insurance may not cover it if you're out of the recommended ages since there's no good evidence it would do very much, but you would still be free to pay for it out of pocket if your doctor was cool with it.  I think it's a couple hundred bucks from when I checked before they started covering it for guys (I was debating whether to just pay for it and then they started covering it because the FDA approved it for men).  You just have to get the first shot while under the age limit and your insurance should pay for the whole series.  FYI it does depend on your doctor, I would give it to any patient that asked if they had a good rationale but the standard response is that you have to be within the age range.  Generally though if you have a reasonable reason you could probably convince most doctors.  Like if you told them you're dating someone new and found out that they have genital warts and are afraid you'll get them but don't want to dump them, or if you told them you haven't had a lot of sex partners before but are planning on going on a string of one night stands or something (because if you've already had a lot of partners you've probably already come in contact with those strains of HPV so the vaccine doesn't necessarily do anything-so you have to not have had a lot of partners to really benefit). "
7928,"> I don't think they would stop you from getting vaccinated, but I'm not sure if they would give you the series(?)

We aren't anti vaccine and either is their pediatrician.. But he def is not for flu shot and a few others. In the end though its all a personal choice.

The person they think they have to disclose to, could be a carrier as well and expose them to more strains. I need to know that whoever I'm about to engage in sex with, is HPV literate and is aware that strains are likely going to be exchanged whether they like it or not. "
7948,I'm sorry but all cancers happen due to compromised immunity so you couldn't have had a perfectly healthy immune system.

7968,I'm guessing the cost is 'sexist' because HPV has been linked with cervical cancer. The impact on women of vaccination is considered to be greater than on men (although clearly beneficial to both).

7985,">In children, the mode of transmission of HPV infection is not as straightforward (see Box 1). Sexual transmission is recognized as a possibility in children, but other possible modes of transmission have been documented (Adams, 2001; de Jesus et al., 2003; Hadlich & Kohl, 1998).

>Vertical transmission of the HPV virus from infected mother to her infant can occur (de Jesus et al., 2003; Frazier, 1998; Hadlich & Kohl, 1998). Adams' (2001) classification scale for evaluating medical findings of suspected sexual abuse lists ano-genital warts/condyloma in a child younger than 2 years of age as a nonspecific finding for sexual abuse—perinatal transmission must be considered. Vertical transmission can occur through the bloodstream prior to birth, or at the time of birth, as the infant passes through the infected birth canal (Frazier, 1998). Delivery via caesarean section does not eliminate the possibility of vertical transmission of HPV; there are reports of congenital condyloma after caesarean section without premature rupture of membranes (Syrjanen & Puranen, 2000). Syrjanen and Puranen state that HPV transmission can occur in utero through semen, ascending infection from the mother's genital tract, or transplacentally. Vertical transmission of the HPV virus does not mean that warts must be present at birth or shortly after birth. HPV is a latent virus and can reside in the skin and mucous membranes without causing warts. The warts may not appear until months or even years after birth (Frazier).

>It is important to understand that the absence of visible ano-genital warts in the mother during pregnancy does not eliminate the possibility of vertical transmission to the child (Frazier, 1998). HPV can cause subclinical infection, meaning the virus can be present on the cervix or in the vagina without causing warts (Frazier).

>Ano-genital warts (HPV) also can be transmitted via autoinoculation (Cohen, 1997; Syrjanen & Puranen, 2000). Children with a common wart on their hands or elsewhere on their body can transmit the virus by touching their warts and then touching their own genitals.

>HPV can be transmitted nonsexually from direct contact with caretaker contaminated with genital HPV or common warts (Cohen, 1997; Syrjanen & Puranen, 2000). For example, caretakers with genital warts who touch or scratch their genitals and then without washing their hands change a baby's diaper or assist a child with toileting/bathing may transmit the virus to the child's genitals. A caretaker with common warts of the hands could transmit HPV in the same manner. HPV transmission via contact with contaminated objects or surfaces is possible (Syrjanen & Puranen). Evidence exists that HPV can be transmitted on small water droplets called foamites (Frazier, 1998). Foamites have been found in the underwear of people with HPV, and Savin (2001) proposes that foamites may be a source of initial infection or reinfection with HPV. Re-innoculation may occur in people who do not change their underwear frequently (Savin).

tl;dr from the mother in birth related processes, from contaminated articles of clothing, or from simple contact (hand to genitals, hand to something the child touches, child's hand to genitals)."

8002,"HPv is a virus, not a disease."
8003,"Only particular (high-risk) strains can increase the risk of cancer. Most strains are harmless. Even the strains that cause genital warts are considered 'harmless'. The warts generally don't hurt or itch, can be very small and even be practically invisible (many people don't know they have them), and they will go away by themselves untreated. "
8004,"It's what people who know they are infected want to believe. There's little research concerning low-risk HPV because it's basically harmless. Most studies deal with high-risk HPV. Today's technology might not be enough to detect a latent infection. Women with infections that seemed cleared got symptoms again more often with new partners. However, even women who claimed not to have new partners had symptoms emerge again after years. So whether most people clear it or not, doesn't really matter as long as there isn't a possibility to test for overall HPV presence. How is one supposed to know whether they are one of the ""most"" or one of the unlucky ones with a dormant infection?

8009,"That's old news, it's now recommended for people up to 40, and beyond if they so desire. "
8010,"Vaccines train the immune system by introducing antigens, which are (usually) a polypeptide, sometimes full proteins.  Your cells respond and are better equipped to recognize them in the future, and act fast enough that the new infection is destroyed before it can spread enough to cause symptoms.

For any infection you might have 20 different antibody-antigen reactions.  When the ""correct"" HPV strain says hi, all 20 respond and you have a fast response.  For a different strain, maybe only 4-8 fit, and you get a partial response.  What this means for the organism can vary.  Maybe you get symptoms maybe you don't.  Maybe they go away faster or are less severe. Flu vaccine works this way.  We have solid protection against some strains but weak against others.  But a day in bed beats 4 days in bed so even partial protection is wonderful.
"
8011,"The two HPV vaccines available have been proven to be more than 95% effective at preventing 2 or 4 strains of HPV (95%+ is the standard for ""full protection""). Cervarix prevents HPV-16 and -18. Gardisil prevents HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18. Both vaccines (especially Gardisil) provide partial protection against other strains. Partial protection refers to anything below 95%.

>**Results:** Vaccination reduced the incidence of HPV-31/45 infection by 40.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.9% to 59.0%) and of CIN1–3/AIS by 43.6% (95% CI, 12.9% to 64.1%), respectively. The reduction in HPV-31/33/45/52/58 infection and CIN1–3/AIS was 25.0% (95% CI, 5.0% to 40.9%) and 29.2% (95% CI, 8.3% to 45.5%), respectively. Efficacy for CIN2–3/AIS associated with the 10 nonvaccine HPV types was 32.5% (95% CI, 6.0% to 51.9%). Reductions were most notable for HPV-31.

8052,"Women aren't tested for the low-risk strains either. Only for high-risk, only on their cervix, and usually only if they already present with symptoms. "
8053,"I took a second to compose a more in-depth answer:

Most HPV infections in young men and women last no more than one or two years. Your body will usually clear it on its own. But there is some research that suggests that the virus can hide deep in the mucosa for several years, undetectable. 

An HPV-negative test might mean two different things: the virus has been cleared, or the level of infection is so low that tests cannot detect it. 

Therefore, HPV might flare up several years after an infection, when the immune system weakens. More research is needed to find out the real stats on latent infections, but it could be very high and we lack the tests to detect it."
8054,"According to Darron R. Brown, MD, Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine

“Clearance implies that the individual is no longer infected and does not need to worry about possible long-term sequelae of the infection. Proving that HPV is absolutely gone is, of course, impossible. An alternative hypothesis is that HPV can exist in a low-level persistent state and can reactivate later in life and cause disease.""

8056,"Much less of a problem these days. Industry declares all of their trials on clinicaltrials.gov. before results are available, and posts results there when they are. The companies I've worked for now have policies that all studies will be published."
8057,"Eh, it's a good point but it is driving me bonkers because it doesn't really apply to this study but studies in general. I completely understand the point. I suppose it has to be brought up in places like this to educate people. "
8058,"If it's a critical trial that has received a lot of attentions in the medical field you can be sure that it will be published, regardless of the result. All ""publicly and privately supported clinical studies of human participants conducted around the world"" will have an entry in the clinicaltrial.gov database. In addition, a large clinical study does not happen in the vacuum. Doctors serve as investigators; review boards approve the protocol, patient advocates watch closely; competitors pay attention. If there is a study that promises a definitive answer on a clinical question, there is virtually no way for a company to hold back the bad results once the trial concludes. People are going to wonder what happened. Staying silent is arguably the worst thing for a pharmaceutical company to do even if the trial fails. 
"
8059,"Oh yea my bad. It's a program of the NIH, not CDC."
8060,I wonder if they've screened those cells for HPV already. Because I would imagine that's standard procedure for cervical cancer. Were you cleared after the cancerous tissue was removed? 
8061,"If you read the article that you cited . . .

""To be sure, the vaccine court has been friendly to some plaintiffs. About $970 million has been awarded in its two decades of existence, and 12,890 cases have been filed. The court has relaxed standards about which witnesses and evidence can be admitted, because its judges -- called special masters -- are better equipped to navigate dubious science than a jury.

And injured parties can still sue vaccine makers in civil court if they reject the vaccine court's decision, if the court dismisses the claim or if the claim is stalled in the court for more than 240 days. Rep. Henry Waxman, who introduced the 1986 bill, hails those limits to the liability shield. ""Vaccines are products that are completely different from any others. We need to encourage companies to develop vaccines in order to protect the public health,"" he says. ""The manufacturers have long fought for total immunity from lawsuits, but I have fought back hard to ensure that the law preserves access to courts in cases of true negligence or misconduct.""

To clarify, for a drug to get approved, it not only needs to demonstrate safety, it needs to demonstrate efficacy that outweighs the risks. 26 is the age where the company that made the drug / the FDA decided that the 1 in X chance of allergic reaction / weird side effect / etc outweighs the possibility that the vaccine will help somebody."

I treat it and then tell them to call their insurance to see if they will pay for the zoster vaccine, although this is only indicated for people 60+. Most insurances will still pay for younger people to get it. Age group recommendations just exist so health providers will screen at these ages for people who need certain vaccines."

8087,They can give you the shingles vaccine but insurance doesn't cover it till you're 60 so it'd be over $200.
8088,">She said I had to be 26 or younger.

For some utterly bizarre reason the recommendation is for under 27's, regardless of sexual history, despite the fact that it's sexual history that's relevant not age.  Someone who has had 1 sexual partner since they were 16 and is now 40 and onto their second partner is at as much risk if not more than someone who is 16.1 and is now onto their second sexual partner.  

The thinking is that by 27 virtually everyone is exposed already and the vaccine won't do any good.  Which seems to be based on a statistical analysis of sexual partners, not based on an individual patients history.  "
8089,"Same here (for hpv, not shingles). Went to the doc at 27 and asked about it. She basically said I was a year too late (in a nicer tone). I have never brought it up again since, since I just figured it was for ages 26 and under. I just turned 33 and am in a longterm monogamous relationship, but if I can still get the vaccine now? I am calling my doctor tomorrow and making an appointment. "
8090,"You most likely do not need the shingles vaccine right now. Since you had chicken pox, you already have immunity to the virus. Shingles occurs when your immune system weakens, causing the virus to affect you again. Usually, this only happens when you get older and your immune system weakens. Getting the vaccine now isn't likely to do anything since your immune system is functioning fine."
8091,"They want this early as youth and young adults tend to have more partners and therefore have greater exposure. In Ontario, it's given out in grade 8 ""before"" sexual activity onset "
8092,"the issue is insurance. insurance will cover it up to 26. this means if you're over 26, many providers won't give it to you. even if you offer to pay the full price on the spot. this is especially likely to be true of ""nurse in a box"" providers at drug stores. an actual doctor has more discretion."

8102,"Q: Who should get HPV vaccine?
A: All kids who are 11 or 12 years old should get the three dose series of HPV vaccine. Teen boys and girls who did not get the vaccine when they were younger should get it now. Young women can get HPV vaccine through age 26, and young men can get vaccinated through age 21. The vaccine is also recommended for gay and bisexual young men (or any young man who has sex with men) and also for young men with compromised immune systems (including HIV) through age 26, if they did not get HPV vaccine when they were younger.

That's quoted from the CDC website. It's not that you can't get it, or that they would stop you (probably). What it more than likely comes down to is that insurance will not cover it unless you fall into the prescribed age limits."
8103,[deleted]

8116,"Absolutely!  I think this is where we run into problems around really common STI's like HSV and HPV, is that instead of dealing with it as an issue associated with  life and living, we treat it as an issue that is highly stigmatized.   It was staggering to sit down and think about the figures behind, let's take HPV-1 for an example.  As a thirty something I have had quite literally dozens of kissing experiences, stats say that about 62% of adolescence and that 85% of adults have been infected by HSV-1, not one person in my life has ever said to me ""hey look, before we kiss, you should know I have HSV-1"".  Not because none of my partners had it, as the stats would suggest probably most of them had it.

8121,"until you're sterile. warts are just warts, its not a big deal at all."
8122,"Tea tree oil may work, but be very careful with it, the skin down there is a lot more sensative and if you have any on the penis itself it's better not to do it because you'll get pretty sever chemical burns if you use full strength solution. If you do have to do it, make sure you dilute it."
8123,"Tea trea oil. It works, trust me."
8124,"Uh, sorry. Don't know. I didn't have them so close to mucous membranes and I didn't have to use ACV, because we still have quite available prices in health care here. It's usually people from other countries, who can't afford to see professionals, who use it. And they swear it works. "
8125,What do you mean by you don't have the money to live a healthy lifestyle? Do you mean 'I can't afford amentities and basic health care' or do you mean 'the macdonalds menu is cheaper than buying vegetables'?
8126,Where do you live?
8127,Where do you live? Here in Miami there are walkins that would test and talk and explain it to you for free with no appointment. I don't know what they would prescribe or how much follow ups would be but you could at least get informed. Maybe find a clinic and just ask for information on any local places you could go for cheap testing???
8128,"The really blows! 

I had the shots after I was infected with genital warts, at age 20. They were cleared from my system after using Aldera and I've never had another problem. "
8129,Female. Idk I just called the county health department and that was the price.
8130,It's preventive health. I called the number on the back of my card and asked.
8131,I'm a lady and got it before insurance covered it- three shots at $150 per shot. Worth every penny though! 
8132,I think it depends where you are!
8133,I got it for free and I'm a man.
8134,Only the hot girls get in for free. Like at the clubs.
8135,"It also causes a substantial proportion of penile, anal and oropharyngeal cancers too"
8136,"Also associated with Anal cancer and penile cancer. Besides, if you treat only the males, the females are obviously not going to contract it. Easier to treat the vector."
8137,"I believe men can be carriers though, so men getting the shoot can help prevent women from getting it and thus prevent those cervical cancers. I'm a guy and my insurance is getting billed $200-$250 per shot. "
8138,"My guess is that because the clinical research was on women even if it benefits men it is considered an off-label use and that lets the insurance companies deny the claim. 

I once had a scrip for a fairly expensive pill that had some wonderful benefits for people with MS fatigue syndrome but the studies were not on those patients. My doctor had to fill out a form documenting for the insurance company that mine was for one of the uses which were approved by the FDA. "
8139,"Yet if 100% if men where vaccinated and zero% of women, have the same result of reducing cancer?

It seems like the benefit to give the vaccine to a man is equally beneficial to the woman.  But I'm sure there are some nuances to distribution that make it more complicated."
8140,"I've already gotten it, I figured the money was still worth it.  It simply wasn't the policy within healthcare at the time. Hopefully that policy will change if it hasn't already."
8141,darn! sorry to hear that! where were you? mind me asking?
8142,It's much more effective to vaccinate the same number of men rather than the same number of women. 
8143,"Already commented on, but women would get the HPV from males. If you prevent it in males, you thusly prevent it in everyone they contact (male or female) . Males are susceptible to penile cancer from hpv as well as anal cancer. "
8144,And vaccinating men decreases the number of carriers.  So there still is no excuse of excluding men.
8145,"I'm aware of this, however HPV is also the main cause of penile cancer and a major contributor to anal carcinoma. It's not just women we are concerned about here. 
In all honesty it would be easier to just vaccinate males as they are the vector for HPV. If you prevent it in males, you thusly prevent it in females (female to female transmission is almost 0). It would actually be more cost effective and smarter way to manage.
I got it so any future partners wouldn't be effected. I felt i owed it to them!
"
8146,[The HPV vaccine is also effective against HPV-associated throat cancer.](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/hpv-vaccine-shown-to-protect-against-oral-form-of-infection)
8147,Ah so I presume your parents would pay for it were you sufficiently concerned. 
8148,Do they usually check you for the various hpv strains before administering the vaccine?
8149,HPV infections end up disappearing pretty quick most of the time anyhow.
8150,2 out of more than a dozen is not plenty. 16 and 18 extremely rarely cause external warts. Those prefer the mucous membranes where they cause cancerous lesions. 
8151,"The thought is that, by age 26, those people who would benefit from the vaccine (i.e. those with multiple sexual partners) would've already been exposed to the the virus. This would sort of defeat the purpose of administering the vaccine. 

As to why the specific age of 26 was chosen, I'm not exactly sure but I know that this was the upper limit of the age range in the HPV vaccine studies. 

Edit: The likelihood that someone with multiple sexual partners has been exposed to HPV by age 26 is so high that it doesn't make sense (from a public health perspective) to administer the vaccine. Plain and simple. Many people who are infected with HPV clear the virus on their own and have no sequelae. "
8152,"Nope, still recommended

Note the lack of exclusion criteria for the age group"
8153,"There are multiple strains of HPV, even if you have had sex and have been exposed to one, the vaccine will protect you from the others, so they do still recommend it."
8154,"No where in there does is not recommend the vaccine for sexually active individuals. You should do more ""research""."
8155,"I read the wiki page. When am I qualified to say I've done ""a LOT""?"
8156,Nothing in that document supports anything you're claiming.

I'm just a dog."
8182,"I agree. As a 35 year old woman, this vaccine was not available when I was in the age range to receive it. I also was  diagnosed with HPV and carcinoma in SITU on my cervix.  The bad news was delivered at my 2nd check up after finding out I was pregnant. I could hear my doctor and another doctor outside my exam room door, discussing whether or not I would have full blown cervical cancer if I carried my child to term. After a lot of thought and discussion with my husband, we decided to continue with the pregnancy. Everything ended up turning out fine for us. After my daughter was born, they froze off the top layer of my cervix. Ten years later, and all subsequent check-ups have been normal. Well, I guess normal, I have not been able to conceive since, but I am healthy. I do have a friend who lost his wife to cervical cancer, she neglected pap smears and she paid for it with her life, leaving behind a 4 year old son as well. HPV can have life-changing or even life-ending consequences for a few, it's not to be taken lightly. I know my daughter will be receiving the vaccine."
8183,"i dont think she's saying you should avoid the vaccine, but for the majority of people who do hpv, things turn out okay. getting hpv is normal (if you consider something that happens to 80-90% of people ""normal""). youngins should still get vaxxed, but hpv is neither something to be cavalier about nor something that should merit panic attacks"

8185,"I don't think the people in that area have the luxury of looking at it like that.

8186,"Moreover, the Taliban has been given additional incentive to consider the vaccinations a military threat against them and act with force."
8187,It's a little bit everyone fault. No one's hands are totally clean here.
8188,"> The CIA used vaccinations to plot an assassination,

The CIA use lots of shit to plot assassinations.  I don't see the Pakistanis riling people up against owning cell phones or installing plumbing or watching satellite TV.

This has nothing to do with the CIA and everything to do with religious fear-mongering in a domain wackaloons like to keep under their thumb - public health.

> I mean, if you were a taliban leader, would you allow healthcare workers to distribute vaccines, knowing that the CIA sometimes hires them to gather intel for assassinating America's enemies including yourself?

Are you asking what I would do if I was a megalomanical war lord intent on controlling my neighbors through superstition and threats of brutality?  Yeah, if I was the kind of guy that chopped off someone's limbs to make a point, I suppose I might be more concerned with the CIA getting a DNA sample (evil wizard magick!) than watching everyone around me paralyzed and asphyxiated by polio.  You've got me there."
8189,"Because those strains are limited by who can get polio, and infections causing mutation are mostly occurring outside areas where people have been vaccinated so far, except in a few isolated cases. Say you drop a drop of water on your kitchen counter, and another about 3 feet away. This is like the small groups that for whatever reason absolutely cannot be vaccinated. They would have to be exposed to polio before they can get it, but once they are, they can. Luckily we nearly eradicated polio in most developed nations.

Get a spray bottle and begin spraying at those two drops of water. This is the anti-vaxxers. Enough sprays and eventually the gap between the drops is almost non-existent. Then the amount of people who can be infected by polio is large enough that if one can get infected, all can. This is what vaccinating as many people can be vaccinated hopes to prevent. "
8190,"Because a virus mutates faster when it has a lot of hosts to infect, the less hosts, the slower the mutation, the longer the vaccines work, the less people get diseases."
8191,That's not how it works either. Not getting vaccinated puts others at risk too.
8192,"Except they aren't - anti-vaxxers aren't the ones at risk, the ones at risk are their children, and any other children they come into contact with who *can't* receive vaccines because of allergies or immunosuppression. 

If it were just the anti-vax crowd putting themselves in danger then well sure, let them. "
8193,"Well, them, and the children and infants too young for the vaccine, like the one month old infant I'm nursing at this moment. We're all vaccinated as much as we can be. Won't help if someone takes their ten year old overseas and comes back with a disease he should have been protected against. And maybe they happen to be in the waiting room when I take her in for her well visit next week.  Which is why my pediatrician doesn't take people who are anti-vaccine as patients.

Edit: if my understanding is incorrect, I'd be really comforted to find out."
8194,Vaccines work on [heard immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity).. i.e. everyone needs to be vaccinated for it to fully be effective. 
8195,"Look up ""herd immunity."" A vaccine isn't a cure. If one person doesn't vaccinate, they put *all* of us at risk."
8196,"Not OP, but it depends on the FDA. They go slow, so 1-5 years is more likely."
8197,The FDA accepted it for review in Feb 2014 and I think the typical timelines or review  is something like 8-10 months. I'm not sure what the process or timeline is like after that point. 
8198,"So, it would be the same adverse reaction to any standard vaccine, too? I'd think that would have been discovered by the time someone had the Gardasil vaccine. Or does it have different components?"
8199,"My mom was waiting for me in the car. << I had told her it wouldn't take long and like 30 mins later I got in the car saying 'Yeah, sorry it took so long nearly passed out.' She freaked a little.

That sucks about the migraines. =/ I had some before my shots, but I have had some with more frequency after. Though I think it's just a coincidence for me, and mine sound 1000x less worse than yours. Like, crippling for a few hours then dull thudding and I'm fine, and they're not too often."

8203,"oh, i'm sorry i read that wrong :\"
8204,Perhaps they had oversight or something. 
8205,"The CDC recommendation for males has been out since 2011, and it's been approved for use in males since 2009....

This isn't a time dependent thing. This stems from the fact that an HPV vaccine, that is just as effective and beneficial to males, is being passed off and marketed as a cervical cancer vaccine. 

GP's aren't going to start pushing for it until the language surrounding the vaccine is changed"
8206,"Its very disheartening. 

NACI can recommend the vaccine to males all they want. The fact is when you use that type of language in the recommendation and don't **promote** vaccination of both male and female children the vaccine gets looked on as physicians as a *female* vaccine.

It took Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, getting HPV caused head and neck cancer before I even saw the idea of males getting the vaccine approached in the media."

Yes of course they're made by scientists... Scientists who are in a position of power in government or on a committee, which may commonly be referred to as an ""official""--someone relating to an authority or public body and its duties, actions, and responsibilities."
8208,"It is not absolutely safe. It does have side effects in some people. Like any drug. The official ones are listed in the patient information leaflet or on the FDA website. The unofficial ones are unsupported claims from either survivors or families of young people (I've only read about girls) who, according to them, suffered serious side effects or died. "
8209,I mean it's possible it wasn't approved yet 5 years ago. Having a bad day? 
8210,Nope I thought the same thing
8211,"That's an interesting hypothesis, but has not been established at all to be the case, which the author notes in the paper. 

They also note, ""The association between age and presumptive reactivation is difficult to measure by means of cross-sectional observational designs, because there is no molecular marker available to distinguish newly acquired infection from persistently detectable or reactivated latent infection.""... Essentially, they're assuming that the infections they see in older women are reactivation from when they were younger, but they can't know. 

It certainly merits further study and I agree that we should probably be more precise and say, ""The virus reaches undetectable levels and is likely cleared in many people in a couple years."" 

However, based on what I read there, I don't believe you can say for certain that a) it's definitely persistent for life or b) becoming immunocompromised will result in detectable infection again. It's a possibility. Maybe.

I got all 3 rounds of the shot 5 years ago, and 2 years ago at my annual gynecological visit they found precancerous cells in my cervix.

8229,How is that shady?
8230,"You do realize that once the vaccination has expired, and you don't get a new one, you are getting hit hard? It's actually better to go just through the standard kids deceases and your body will actually defend itself, totally on its own. Not relying on inocculations every time.

People like me? You don't know me. You've only read one post that shows an opinion I have.
So don't lump me into a group without even having all the facts about me. If you don't like my
opinion, fine, judge that opinion.

"
8231,"So wouldnt you agree more Science is needed to be able to accurately detect the disease for starters?

I feel like detection is at least as important for any disease than just mass manufacturing expensive vaccines. "
8232,"That makes sense, the pharmacist didn't tell me that. "
8233,"It's not really a vaccine, more of a booster shot. You already have resistance to shingles because you had Chicken Pox. They're caused by the same virus (Varicella Zoster), with shingles occurring in adults. It goes into dormancy inside your nervous system until your immune system is weakened, then it manifests itself as shingles. It's essentially immune to your body's defense while in your nervous system, since if your body killed the cells it's waiting in, it would essentially paralyze you.

It's recommended for people over 60 because that's about the time people start to have their immune systems drop off and reemergence of the virus is more likely."
8234,"Pure regulated laziness, very annoying"
8235,"Individual circumstances should be considered, but it's not surprising that a fundamentally statistical field like epidemiology uses statistics to make vaccination recommendations. "
8236,"And a lot of people go through a midlife crisis, possibly resulting in different sexual morals. The bars around here are full of 40 year old horny men and women who are either swingers or divorced.

The moments of promiscuity in people's lives aren't easily predictable anyway."
8237,"Yes, you can. I took the vaccine when I was 28 years old - and I'm a male.

The thing is that vaccines are not tested well above 26. Meaning - they are totally safe, but their efficacy is unproven because they didn't test such age groups. Also - if I remember correctly, it's not like the vaccine has worse effect for older people - it's just that it gets harder to test it, because more and more people have HPV with age.

In other words - yes, go and take the vaccine. And don't get back to the previous doctor."
8238,Why? Isn't it actually pointless if you and your partner remain monogamous?
8239,"The vaccine isn't recommended after 26 as you are thought to be outside of your risk window. At 26 the likelihood is high that you are already exposed or are in a monogamous relationship, thus the benefit of the vaccine is reduced. Basically if you haven't got it by now, the chances of you getting it are small. Now that may not hold true for some Redditors, but as you said you are in a longterm monogamous relationship I would think this argument is sound. 

Whether you insist on the vaccine or not, your insurance is not going to cover it and it will be an expensive series (~$400)
"
8240,Since then I've moved to different places almost yearly. Why were you recommended the shingles vaccine? I now work in a hospital so I figure I might encounter chicken pox again from the child of someone who is opposed to vaccinations. So if I can get poked in the arm and not worry about that disease again then I'll be happy to have one less thing to worry about. 
8241,"Did he have chicken pox though? If you've had chicken pox you are very unlikely to get shingles. And if you haven't, the chicken pox vaccine is still more appropriate when you're young(ish). "
8242,"But not too young for the chicken pox vaccine, which would have prevented your shingles most likely. You asked for the wrong vaccine! "
8243,"That's the age it has been tested up to in clinical trials.  I looked into drug trials of the vaccine and they only wanted people under 27.  I believe it also has to do with statistics, by age 27 you are likely to have been exposed to HPV.  

I got screwed.  When the shot first came out, it was only for women though I met the age criteria.  By the time they approved it for men, I was older than 27 and had contracted HPV.  My Bad Luck Brian story."
8244,"Anyone will do it if you pay upfront. But it'll be like $500 because insurance won't cover it, and it's unlikely to offer much protection at this point. Hence why everyone is telling him ""no"", but he could press the issue and they would give him it. "
8245,In my state if you've had 3 clean yearly std tests by age 24 you only need one every 3 years after that. Seems reasonable. 
8246,Saw that. I disagree. Thanks. Like I said I'll look into it more. Chill. 
8247,A terrible answer? More like just one you don't like. What I have put into my body is my choice. I just had a pap smear again too! Still normal results and all healthy. :) yay! I've never not had a normal pap smear. :) 
8248,"I have never had the flu shot in my life or the HPV.  

Anti vaccines means you are against vaccines, which I am not. My child in fact just got the polio vaccine recently. However.. I don't get EVERY vaccine offered. That doesn't make me anti vaccine. :)"
8249,Actions speak louder than words...

8251,[deleted]
8252,It is if it's only used in research. That means it's not available to the general public which in turn means it's not available to men unless they are in a research setting. And it's moot not mute. 
8253,"My experience around disclosure surrounding really common STD's like HPV and HSV is that this type of mentality around disclosure has inherent risks outside of transmitting diseases.  The reality is that when you're engaging in sexual encounters with others is that you not only have your morals and ethics to take into consideration, but you have theirs as well.  So while not disclosing because ""for better or worse, if your partners have had other sex partners, they, like you, are likely to have had HPV in the past, whether they know it or not"" or ""with some partners, the issue becomes emotional, largely due to mis-information and unwarranted stigma attached to the infection"", disclosure is a personal choice, but it is not just YOUR personal choice.  Not disclosing to partners who believe they have a right to be informed and believe they have a right to have sex with partners who are honest and forthright will raise large concerns around trust, deceit, betrayal, honesty, ect. I'm not saying you're wrong, but just some food for thought. 

Edit:  The person you accredited isn't the same person who wrote the blog.  He goes on to say further in the blog that the virus isn't transmittable if warts aren't present which is complete misinformation   ""The virus can still rub off a person's skin even when he or she has no warts that you can see"" https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/3837/"
8254,Tell that to this guy/gal that's accusing me of being a troll because I asked her how s/he is planning to stop the spread of skin-to-skin STIs :-D Her/his idea is to tell  high-school children they are going to get horrible diseases because of them
8255,"So, everybody who disagrees with you is a troll. You don't really understand the definition of the word, do you? It's just really popular so it's OK to throw it around freely. Allright. I'll just wait for your proposal for the method of stopping the spread of skin-to-skin STIs."
8256,"We're talking about health related harm. The surgery had nothing to do with warts and warts can't be held responsible for my asshole of an employer firing me because I was sick. The only harm I felt was because of people like you. Reading things like those you write was emotional torture. I was scared and desperate, while in reality there was nothing wrong with me, I just had some extra skin on my genitals. Huge advocates of avoiding catching it are delusional and know nothing about how HPV works. The only way to avoid it completely is abstinence or the strictest way of monogamy. I want people to know the facts and not the irrational BS. "

They will either clear the virus (normal immune response) within 2 years or the virus will remain and potentially cause problems.  The vaccine would not help in either case.

There is. The risk that HPV would cause cervical cancer in women than it would penile cancer in men is much greater, hence the insurance industry's coverage of the vaccine for women. Personally, I think they should cover both men and women, owing to the obvious reciprocal nature of how the disease is spread. "
8338,"Yes, but because of the nature of the virus, these types of cancer aren't as prevalent. Think of it like a sort of 30 Second Rule, except instead of not being able to eat a cookie that fell on the floor because of icky germs, you have upped your likelihood of developing cancer on the body part that had been exposed to an infected partner's bodily fluid... Er... Does that make any sense? A heterosexual woman's cervix is the place most likely to be affected by this ""phenomenon,"" as well as her vagina. But a homosexual male's rectum & anus are also at an increased risk for developing cancer, but not in such a high proportion (for a couple of reasons: obviously the biggest being there are FAR more heterosexual females than homosexual males). Penile cancer is VERY rare; I'm not sure whether the presence of foreskin makes a difference (because of an increase in the likelihood that their positive partner's bodily fluid would be held against their genitals for an increased period of time) but it would make sense. And, since there is no HPV test for males, until a large enough number of males develop penile cancer to form a correlation, we won't know. Hopefully that statistic-hunt won't be necessary, though, and people will just get vaccinated, and **get informed**: it's amazing how little I knew about HPV before I lucked out and caught me one of them cancerous strands! Most people still think it's just genital warts. If only, huh?"

It also discounts 40% of the male population that considers themselves straight yet has had a sexual encounter with another male. That wouldn't eliminate those HPV cases/ vectors. Thus allowing a pool for transmission to females. 
However if you vaccinate all the males, that pool is in fact eliminated. The physical requirements for lesbians to transmit HPV just really isn't an issue (female to female rates are almost zero). "

8419,"... that's not semantics, that's basic reading comprehension. 

being sexually active doesn't mean you've caught everything it could protect you against. For example you might have had sex with another virgin and had very low odds of catching anything.

It's recommended before you're sexually active and when you're young because that's the ideal time to get it when it provides the most potential benefit.  

That does not negate that it can still provide benefit if you're older and already sexually active.

If I say ""I recommend trying out that new restaurant tonight"" I'm not implying that it will be terrible every other night.

>**Should the vaccines be given to people who are already infected with HPV?**

>Although Gardasil and Cervarix have been found to be generally safe when given to people who are already infected with HPV, the vaccines do not treat infection and they provide maximum benefit if a person receives them before he or she is sexually active (17).

>It is possible that someone infected with HPV will still get residual benefit from vaccination, even if he or she has already been infected with one or more of the types included in the vaccines. However, this possibility is still under investigation.

>At present, there is no generally available test to show whether an individual has been exposed to HPV. The currently approved HPV DNA test shows only whether a person has a current HPV infection, and it identifies the HPV type. But it does not provide information on past infections."

It was actually based in the idea that I had enough courage to discuss this with partners, so I should.  Believe me, I have been all over the map as to where my responsibility starts and ends with my partners, and have thoroughly gone through all of the reasons why I could not disclose, but at the end I was always left with the reality that I know this information about myself and I feel like I have a responsibility to tell future partners.  I did extensive research on all of this.  I'm very aware how harmless HPV is.  I always compared it to, well, I wouldn't not hold someone's hand who had a finger wart.  It was just a decision I had to make for my self, and I encourage others to also.  Not because of the morality, but because I would want to encourage others to be empowered by their sexuality.  I haven't had issues with casual or committed relationship by exercising disclosure.  I actually believe that if I was to be rejected because of how someone stigmatizes something that really falls on their ignorance.  I hope you don't feel I was harsh, I feel I may have come across a little dogmatic in my replies, and I'm sorry for that.  That's not my position.  I understand why someone would not disclose, I would like to at times also, my conscience just wouldn't let me.  "

I live in the Bible Belt. Can you tell?

It's choosing to be ignorant and ignoring the fact that our kids are people in their own right and only they can make choices about their sexual behaviors. It's our job as parents to make we make decisions when they are young that will benefit them as adults. 

I have 4 sons. I never hesitated to give them the HPV vaccine, not only for their benefit but the benefit of anyone they ever have sexual contact with. And I made sure they understood what it was and why they are receiving it.

Its been difficult for them to be heard, since in our society we are very much pro-vaccination. But our national television took the time to contact all of these girls (we are a small country) and talk to some established and respected doctors, and the correlation seems to be accepted now. - We did not blow out of proportion the less than 0.1% who seem to develop side effects. - But since the parents did not even know there could be any severe sideeffects, frustration is understandable.

But yeah if you give it to girls for free chances are you are hiking up the prices on the boys vaccines. Cut it in half to 150 bucks a pop and life is better for both genders and its still relatively cheap for a vaccine that lasts as long as it does. 

But honestly the VFC will help pay for the vaccine for boys if you can't afford it but medically the vaccine is medically more effective on women than men and the argument could be made that because of that the vaccine is better spent on women and thats why it's free for them. 

Money is hard to keep a handle on. The people who make vaccines aren't a charity. Costs money to research and develop and study and test and collect materials and pay workers to distribute and manage and then payout to families that sue for a faulty vaccine and all that. So expecting a free vaccine is just crazy. Someone's gotta pay for it otherwise all those workers aren't going home with a paycheck.

The HPV vaccine is still in early trial stages in terms of epidemiology. We don't know if it works yet, because those girls who have had the vaccine are not yet eligible for screening. We won't know if it has a major impact on the rate of cervical cancer for another 30 or so years.

Taking this in to account, it's understandable that it's not been rolled out to all just yet. Cervical cancer was once one of the most common causes of cancer related deaths in women in the UK, due to the screening programme it no longer is. Comparatively, anal cancer has a low rate of cases. This doesn't mean it's not important, but it's not so much an epidemiological issue. 

Once its effectiveness has been determined, then it should absolutely be rolled out to everyone, both for herd immunity and to avoid other cancers.

It's not so much discrimination as much cost vs benefit. As cervical cancer is such a big issue in women, it has the greatest effect when given to women. Or may have. At the moment we have no idea what effect the vaccine has had."
8535,Absolutely agree: if HPV causes cancer and other issues in females it will almost certainly be shown to do the same for males. Males may not have a cervix but biology is biology.
8536,"Odd, I had mine covered by my insurance (started the shots as a 26 y.o. guy). I do think my doctor helped me out by choosing it a certain way so it was preventative and completely free."
8537,"I got the shot. Was awkward though because my father is hugely against the HPV vaccines. But not in the anti-vax mentality, just this ome vaccine. All those unsubstantiated claims are apparently substantiated in his eyes.

Anyone have any advice I could use to try and get him to reason? Cause this is literally a vaccine for cancer god dammit."
8538,"I was living in Wales, UK and was given two HPV shots at the age of around 22 for free.  (Not sure how useful it is at that age tbh, but it was offered by a nurse, I did not request it) before I could get the third, I moved back to my hometown in England, and told them I needed the third job. Despite being unemployed (and in receipt of welfare at the time) I was told I would have to buy a private prescription of £180 to get the third shot because I was in England now. Needless to say, I couldn't afford it, and have still not had the shot."
8539,I had it when I was 13 in Ontario... On my immunization record its under publicly funded immunizations... Just head over here to the promise land :p
8540,I got it for free at school last year
8541,"ITT: People who's understanding of the word ""should"" is grossly inadequate."
8542,"I don't think the benefit to boys at this point can be said to exceed the risks of the vaccine.  there are many cases of side-effects, sometimes permanent."
8543,"Ive had a horrible few years living with it once, i didn't know there was a vaccine..."
8544,"Mom is right because herd immunity. The vaccine might not work on certain women, but they may be protected because their sexual partner has been vaccinated."
8545,"Although the rates and consequences are worse for girls, health should always be equitable when it can be - I am happy for taxes to help boys become vaccinated. "
8546,It sad to say it bit people in my town are very against getting the vaccine. :/
8547,"Agree.. if you want to give a vaccine away to save people from getting disease, make it free to both, or neither.  Giving it free to one does nothing.  I know HPV only affects women but let's increase our immunization to it rather than only give the vaccine to a half of the population. "
8548,"In males it causes throat and tongue cancer, so yeah, free for boys, too.
"
8549,"Well, that's bull finkle."
8550,Equality.
8551,"If there are cancers we can eradicate with vaccinations, you'd think we'd jump on it."
8552,Virgin male here. I took the cheapest route of protection. 
8553,NOTHING IS FREE YOU COMMIES!!!
8554,"Why does any vaccine cost money?
"
8555,"Not sure what the argument for this is, since even if you don't care about male people getting HPV, which you should, policy makers trying to cover your asses, dudes who have it can spread it to unvaccinated girls, harming GIRLS! "
8556,"I live in BC, and was given this shot FOR FREE in not only grade 6, but the second one as well in grade 9. It should ABSOLUTELY be free for both genders, as both genders can carry it. "
8557,But muh equality
8558,This thread should be higher than that Donald Trump BS.
8559,that male privilege amirite
8560,Mine was free...
8561,In Australia we get it as part of our childhood immunisation program. All for free.
8562,How was the insurance? It was a free option for me (US Teen)
8563,"I don't understand how the vaccine isn't already free... I guess the government doesn't feel it's necessary?

I'd just send my son in dressed up in a hello kitty outfit to get the vaccine. "
8564,Young Australian male here. Got free HPV vaccination last year.
8565,Mandatory too
8566,I paid 700$ for all three shots in my country. Free for girls. 
8567,"I decided to get the vaccine at 24 as I am considered 'low risk' still. It's not funded at my age in my country.

I waited because it's 3 shots and no data was available about its effectiveness in the long term at that time (obviously).

The data looks really good now and I decided to get it before I started dating seriously again. All up the whole course is going to cost me just under $500 NZD. 

It's fucking expensive. I don't mind taking the hit for the sake of my health as HPV is prolific. What frustrates me is that it is not targeted at boys at the same time as the girls. It's common fucking sense. Yes we women suffer the cancers caused by HPV at a far greater rate but I feel the vaccines effectiveness would be better than it currently is (and it's pretty fucking good) if boys were targeted the same as women.

If I have sons that is one gift I am giving their future partners. "
8568,"lol at ""free."" 

I want airline travel to be free, and ski passes, and pizza!

By that I mean that someone else should pay for it, so ""free to me,"" which is what I think Fiona Brinkman (the B.C. mother) means."
8569,"There's an old joke. ""If men could get pregnant birth control and abortions would be free."" Well, when HPV is  transmitted to men via cunnilingus it results in brain cancer. Still, the vaccine isn't free for men."
8570,"This is a matter of health care economics.  HPV vaccines for all males is not a good value for the money.  Don't believe me?  Check the research.  The risk of HPV cancers is not spread evenly.  Females develop HPV related cancers more often and the cancers are generally worse.  Males who develop cancer from HPV are typically sub-group (MSM who develop anal cancers, for example) and not the whole of the male population.

Utility of vaccine decreases with age, though even that is not equal for males and females.  Females are cost-effective to vaccinate up to age 26 or so.  Males are not really cost-effective during late teens.  MSM are a larger concern because of the higher cancer risk, but only before they are exposed to the various strains of HPV (common vaccines protect against 4 or 9 strains).

It seems discriminatory that females are given preference, but it this scheme is best for public health.   Non-sexually active feels benefit the most from the vaccine.  Value is pretty high for all women, even those in their early 20s.  Not so much for guys."
8571,How are doctors and pharmaceutical executives going to take multiple vacations on luxury yachts if we start giving shit away for free? Honestly.
8572,I completely agree.
8573,World news lol wtf
8574,"I had to vaccinate my daughter during a gap in insurance.   My choice was $500, or No Vaccine and risk her health.

I paid the $500 and didn't even flinch.  if I had to pay $300 for each of my kids for this, I would.  It SUCKS ASS having to, but I still would.

Kids> Money"
8575,Completely agree! Why should anyone have to pay for it while someone else gets it for free? it's an extremely important vaccine
8576,ITT: people that don't understand how epidemiology works. 
8577,"TRIGGERED!!! How dare you say that boys should get something that girls get, don't you know how sexist that makes you seem? So anti-feminist."
8578,[removed]
8579,"Right now the major roadblock to universal HPV vaccination is social conservatives who fear it will make their daughters sexually active earlier.  Those same people seem to be a little less angry when it is their sons getting laid.

That in and of itself is a good reason for free vaccines for boys."
8580,"Is HPV that serious for boys?

Edit: The reason it can be serious for girls is that it's a big cervical cancer risk factor, for anyone unaware. "
8581,"This title is every single SJW on the internet in 10-20 years.

""Why is it free for girls and not for boys!?""

""Because people like you, who like to bitch, wouldn't let up about false female inequality 15 years ago!"""
8582,Ugh this article belongs in /r/titlegore. i was scared the article would be as bad
8583,Does it kill boys like it kills girls?
8584,"This is a stupid question so forgive me, but I'm being honest:

As far as I know HPV causes cervical cancer in women but has no symptoms in men.
Why then do gay men matter in this debate?"
8585,Men don't usually get cervical cancer.
8586,Grade 6??
8587,"I believe the issue isn't exactly the same as many think.   The problem is that the FDA approved studies were focused on females.  The insurance companies use FDA onlabel usage as the primary criteria for preventative measures.   If you're a virgin and 27, female,  you're clearly going to receive the same exact preventative nature from a triple dose of Gard9,  BUT the FDA's studies only go to 26,  so you're SOL even though technically...   So without proper indication studies at the FDA level,  insurers aren't going to pay.   This is a similar problem in many arenas,  psych care for example,  not a DSM specific diagnosis?  No insurance coverage.  I've seen cases of unresolved medical problems that fall outside of ICD9 purview (weird idiopathic things with no real cause or specific  criteria) even though CLEARLY there is a physical reality to their problem,  the cause and symptom being unknown and not a primary care criteria,  weren't covered.   This includes the ultrasounds, xrays and other such that uncovered nothing.   It is weird.  ICD10 addresses a lot of this though so,  it'll prolly not find itself as much of an issue.    There's so much weirdness with insurance coverage specifications,  it is hard to really understand.  But for HPV vacc.  this is the usual problem.   

Another example is that I take wellbutrin,  because it helps a lot with ADD in conjunction with the  Vyvanse I take.   I'm not depressed,  never have been,  but my medical records show this is why I take it,  otherwise the offlabel use is not covered by my insurance even THOUGH it works very well... "

8589,"I paid almost $600 for that fucking thing, 3 x $200 shots.

Oh and when I asked for it, the doc said ""but you're not a woman?""

...I didn't know that HPV could only affect women. /s

"
8590,Can't he just identify as a girl for the sake of getting the shot for free? Technically they can't even question this without discriminating.
8591,"ALWAYS question ANYTHING that is ""free""."
8592,"I agree.  Not everyone is going to vaccinate their daughters because they think it will  make them sluts (ingnorant of them), so if the boys can be easily vaccinated, **it will** help prevent the spread of the virus."
8593,"Well, women get cervix cancer.  With men it's not so bad. It's only PENIS CANCER!!!! FUCKING RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!"
8594,Let's see if the right throws a massive tantrum about how the vaccine given to young teenaged boys will lead to them being sluts later in life.
8595,"Whether hpv vaccines should be free or not is not up for this citizen to decide. Making an effort to vaccinate girls for free is already a big thing and probably very v efficient maneuver. 

For the top commentator who had a cervical neoplasia: great to hear you're fine."

8600,ITT: people have no idea that the HPV vaccine has not once been proven to stop cervical cancer. There is literally zero research documenting the claim.
8601,"Free?

It should be OUTLAWED. A very bad medicine furthered by very bad science. 

Interesting to note that Merck ONLY tested this garbage ON MALES before it was unleashed on the world too, isn't it?"
8602,"That vaccine (isn't worth it imo) does have a high success rate. It's one of the proven dangerous vaccines bc a high percentage of people have high side effects. The initial hpv test by cdc was very vague, and testing for hpv was rare. However, the inoculation of throat cancers for men and anal/ cervical cancer for women is successful in trails sponsored by the manufacturer. 100% of people enjoy Budweiser according to Budweiser, also. Most independent studies were inconclusive, or taken to trail by the company and suppressed.   

This has been heavily edited."
8603,"Too bad the HPV vaccine cause multiple life treating diseases and have killed hundreds of young girls. 
Even one of the founders of gardasil announced that this vaccine is a joke and 'completely unnecessary'. "
8604,"Everything _should_ be free. If you're ever paying for something, then its likely you're participating in capitalism which only exists because of a series of serious flaws within the human condition and civilization. It's a broken system for garbage life forms, but its what we have and it'll never go away so pay to innocculate your dumb ugly child or maybe don't, they're going to die anyway and they will live a fruitless life that makes no positive lasting impact on the world, even to those they live or are immediately in their lives."

8606,"I'm glad you are ok! My mom also had cervical cancer from HPV. So, I've been through it with her. Hers was stage 3b and she has been cancer free for 6 years now. Best if luck to you! "
8607,"You're absolutely correct - People seem to forget that while many males don't show symptoms, they still contract the virus and spread it to others. I'm glad you understand the concept of herd immunity! ;)"
8608,[removed]
8609,I got the vaccination (covered by my insurance under preventative care) and my girlfriend has been okay. She had two forms of HPV (speculation by her obgyn) and had to get part of her cervix cut out. She went back in July and was fine. So 6 months cancer free! Wish more people had it as easy as me.
8610,"It should be noted that in addition to this, HPV *can* cause serious health problem in boys and men as well.  My uncle's current cancer came from having HPV for so long and not knowing about it."
8611,"If you don't mind me asking, how far progressed was your cancer, and what type of treatment did you receive? I was just called back saying that my Pap smear was abnormal and they had detected a lesion, but to just follow back up in a year. I've been very anxious about it. Glad to hear you are doing well now. 
"
8612,How do you know you have it?
8613,"If women get the vaccine, then straight males are protected. Per the article, the government recently announced it will give the vaccine for free to vulnerable males --- which includes gays. 

Doubling the cost to cover 100% might not yield much in return. "
8614,Nothing is free
8615,"Damn, glad you are okay.  Also, guys can get oral HPV and that leads to throat cancer. 

*edited* clearly i mean ""can"" and not ""cant"" otherwise I wouldnt have followed it with, ""and that leads to throat cancer""."
8616,should be free and mandatory.
8617,And free prime beef and lobsters!
8618,Males do not develop cancer from HPV at the same rates as females.  Females need to be protected.  And probably MSM.  Not all males.
8619,"If the government pays for it, it is not free, they are stealing it from you."
8620,"My doctor gave me the referral.

Pretty expensive"
8621,"Get a new doctor. 

35F. Got the vaccine at 32. My doctor wrote the script and did a cervical biopsy. Biopsy came back clear, vaccine was given. Doctor said ""anyone sexually active is at risk unless both people are a) 100% monogamous and b) haven't been exposed.""

And remember: hpv can affect throats too. "
8622,If you're sexually active you have (very likely) been exposed and receiving the vaccine is useless. Which is why it's so important that everyone receive it early on. 
8623,Same for me. I would think that because my mom got cervical cancer from HPV and I'm a female that they would make an exception but nope. 
8624,"Same boat, and my doctor actually recommended I get it.... although it wasn't cheap."
8625,"I got it myself. I'm above 30.

I paid for it myself, which is fair enough."
8626,"A major part of the decision to have a cut off age is because you've likely already been exposed to at least one, if not several strains at this point. So your body has already fought them off and will be able to fight off future strains more easily. 
I'm not a medical expert, but that is what my doctor explained to me as a reason why I couldn't get it even though I had similar concerns as you do. Granted there's also the assumption that an older population is more likely to be monogamous, but that's minor compared to the above consideration. "
8627,"I got the shots from my doctor (no referral?). Generally it is better to get it before you are sexually active because you may already have a form of it by the time youre in your late twenties.

I think i was 26/27 when I got it. Cost me nearly $600 out of pocket"
8628,this is america.  someones pockets are much more important than your health.  Now shut up and deal with it /s
8629,"Go to plan parenthood. You'll have to pay for it out of pocket, but it's doable. Insurance won't cover it because their trial set stopped with males over 26.

I couldn't even get it done out of pocket with my physician because his practice, for whatever reason, didn't allow it."
8630,Doesn't really matter to you. It matters to the girls you'll be having sex with. Guess who isn't on your insurance plan? 
8631,"Oddly enough, I've never had to have a referral for it. I've had instances where my insurance didn't cover it, but that was a minor scuffle with some paperwork. 

I've had two of the three shots, and I've never had sex, making the shot for me as every bit effective as it is for a 12-year-old, and they're free!

-Male living in the US."
8632,The reason is more likely that you probably already have it. If you are sexually active you have likely contracted at least one of the strains already. 
8633,You're probably seropositive anyways. 
8634,"If you are an adult who has had sex with other adults, its likely too late for you to be vaccinated. You are likely already exposed and have antibodies against the virus that you are either incubating somewhere or have cleared. 

There are like 70 strains of HPV and the vaccine protects against 4.

"
8635,"You already have HPV, bro"
8636,"The reason why they don't is because the only real symptom men get is genital warts... which is still fucked up. 

How come I have to go to the doctor every time I get a strange rash and whip out my willy for her to go, ""oh.... it's just contact dermatitis"" 

THANKS FOR CLEARIN THAT UP FOR ME DOC... GLAD I DONT HAVE DICK WARTS "
8637,"Surely this is a gender equality issue and as such it will make all the Canadian feminists take a break from protesting the creation of men's centres on college campuses to demand equal access to vaccines...

I won't hold my breath. 

But you get bet your ass that if they gave it only to boys that it would be proof of ""male privilege""..."
8638,its straightforward to you because you have no medical training
8639,"That's not really how you would handle something like this. What matters is the return on investment. Right now 50% of the population gets the vaccine. So by going to 100%, you would double the cost. But how much will be gained by doubling the cost (i.e. what is the return on investment)?  Women need it to prevent cervical and/or ovarian cancer so there is a big payoff for that. And when women get the vaccine, it greatly reduces the odds of men getting HPV of which the genital warts is perhaps the most common issue. 

So is doubling the cost worth the returns you will get? That's the question and we would need that information to really form an opinion on this. "
8640,OK so what should be cut from the budget to pay for the free vaccine 
8641,"I would reach a different conclusion. Since it is an STD that spreads between men and women, it sound pretty simple to just vaccinate the other sex."
8642,The medicine shouldn't be free for boys because then nobody would make it anymore and nobody would get the vaccine.  Just keep it free for girls.  Women's health is important.
8643,"He'd probably be right if everyone was straight, there was no immigration, and no one traveled overseas for work or vacation. "
8644,"Are there any examples of this happening in reverse, where boys are all given it and thus there is herd immunity so the girls don't get any.  Somehow I don't think that would fly so well.
"
8645,Imagine if only men got a vaccine that women could also benefit from.
8646,"Did someone legitimately say herd immunity to a sexually transmitted disease? Its not even respiratory . what are talking about here? The flu? That guy or girl, can eat a dick."
8647,I got the vaccine when I was early 20's for free in the USA...
8648,Free vaccines for corporations?
8649,You ever heard 'if men could get pregnant abortion would be free and common'?  This seems to disagree...
8650,"Why? I was under the impression that HPV isn't really an issue to men's health (but men are carriers and in turn transfer it too women) and that the vaccine is not effective against the strain that commonly affects males. Therefore, the benefit does not justify the cost.

EDIT: My god. I'm trying to understand the topic. I have (admittedly) little knowledge and was trying to discuss a topic to learn more about it.  My current comment is what I currently remember about HPV - and therefore why I currently see no need for a change on this topic. If anybody would actually inform me of my factual shortcomings that would be appreciated as I an genuinely interested in understand the topic."
8651,"Clearly if all boys say they're involved in gay sex, they can get the vaccine. Problem solved."
8652,Doesn't HPV cause genital warts? Why wouldn't we be giving this to both sexes anyway? 
8653,"All the girls in my class got the vaccination and I didn't, they say that if the girls are protected then ill be protected. Well, what happens when I have sex with someone from a different province that didn't vaccinate all their girls?

I was literally told that boys don't get HPV so were not gonna get vaccinated. I'm really fucking pissed off reading this article now."
8654,"It's cheaper than cancer. 

Think for a moment. We could realistically eradicate several viruses within a generation or two. We haven't because savings aren't the same as revenue. You stop something, you save a lot. It's difficult to quantify that which was not spent. "
8655,"Well, it could dramatically reduce the number of gay/bi men who get HPV."
8656,High risk HPVs also cause head and neck cancer the prevalence of which increasing at an extremely fast rate and the majority of this cancer burden is carried by men.  Low risk HPVs can also cause genital warts in both genders.   And while men can't get cervical cancer they can certainly spread the viruses responsible just as easily as unvaccinated women. 
8657,"I pay taxes as anyone else does, and I should have the equal right not to carry HPV because of that.  Sure, I could never get ovarian cancer, but I can easily end up with HPV, not know I'm carrying it (warts varietal is not the same as ovarian cancer one) and give it to a girl that I'm in love with who is not Canadian. She could die or lose the ability to reproduce because of a rather sexist law.  Of course when we were in gr 7-8 the girls were all mad that we didn't have to get shots and they did, but if I could tbt I would have demanded one."
8658,"doesnt really matter, vaccines should be free, period. you shouldnt charge people to prevent diseases, unless you are under the pocket of big pharma."
8659,"Yes, and Canada already provides all required childhood vaccines at no cost. Vaccines required in adulthood are also provided at no cost, while optional ones are provided for those at high risk for free, as well. "
8660,"The problem with your question is that it is very difficult, if not impossible, to get an answer. HPV is undetectable in men, at least until they develop actual symptoms (which the vast majority do not). It is partly for this reason that virtually everyone will get it at some point in their lives."
8661,"Males tend to carry the vaccine and spread it to women. In women, it can cause cervical cancer and infertility. Men can also get throat cancer from HPV. Everyone can get genital warts and rectal cancer from it. HPV can go undetected for years because it doesn't always show symptoms, though it is one of the reasons why women have to get a PAP smear. It is also the most widely spread STI (in the US anyway, not sure about Canada). My guess is,  vaccinating boys and girls would pretty much eliminate infections. -source: I'm a health/sexual health journalist."
8662,"It's hard to say because there are no approved methods of testing for HPV for men. This is absolutely ridiculous since it affects both sexes with equally bad consequences at the end but science and medicine work on the basis of facts.

It seems the issue stems from not wanting to make a difference because the factors stack up. We do not know enough, and it requires an investment. In any case, once people realise how much of an issue this is, vaccinations probably will be handed."
8663,"If it just means fewer men get cancer, why fucking bother, right? It's not like anything of value will be harmed."
8664,It's only expensive because we let it be expensive. 
8665,How the fuck is this up voted so much?
8666,"The cost of the vaccine us minimal compared to the cost of medical care to treat cancer. Besides, why vaccinate half the population? Its like spraying the bushes when your house is on fire."
8667,I'm assuming this vaccine works like most others meaning it requires herd immunity to really be effective. So probably a very large difference compared to only 50% of population getting it.

8670,"I know this site is mostly male and they will want to turn this into ""well if girls get it free,then so should boys"" but your question is an extremely valid and important question to the topic. 

If you give it to all women, wouldn't the chance of men contracting geniltal warts or whatever drop significnatly? So how much is gained by doubling the cost to cover everyone?



I also don't have an opinion on this issue until I see what the 'return on investment' would be. "
8671,"There is never a cause, no matter how noble it seams, that justifies violence and theft."
8672,"Yes, it would be interesting in how far it would benefit boys. Especially since they can't get ovarian cancer... Plus the vaccine only protects against very few of these viruses. Young people would probably be safer if they used real protection instead of relying on vaccines like this."

And if a man develops a relationship with an older woman who aged out of the vaccinations, what then?  My oldest was in the first rounds of the vaccines. If at 25 he starts a sexual relationship with a woman that is 30 and never given the opportunity to be vaccinated and she carries HPV then he would be at risk if never receiving the shot(s). 

Again, not all females out there are choosing to get vaccinated or have had the opportunity to be vaccinated because they age out at 26. 

This attitude I'm seeing is what boggles.

Reddit loves to hate anti-vaxxers when it comes to measels or smallpox or flu, but a lot of comments in this thread have been lukewarm about whether this vaccine should be made more available to boys. their reasoning has been that the effects of HPV are usually worse for girls so it doesn't make sense to run up the costs of the program by covering boys. 

While its true that women face greater risks from HPV, having 50% of the population unprotected creates a massive reservoir for different strains of the virus which can increase the risk of even vaccinated women being infected (since no vaccine is perfect) or in which a resistant variant could arise (ignoring that the virus does indeed increase health risks in men/boys too)"
8850,Are you suggesting that pre-pubescent children should be interviewed for the purpose of attempting to figure out whether they are gay or not?
8851,"By that logic why not just only vaccinate all males for free then instead of females? If all males are vaccinated then they won't pass it on to anyone (if the assumption here is that it is males who are the ones spreading the disease), and vaccinating one half of the population is more cost effective then vaccinating one half (females) plus some (gay males).

Regarding the hpv centres for the girls with side effects, Im not sure I can find a translated article, but perhaps you can use google translate :/ - here is one about the long waiting lists, because more than what was originally thought came forward claiming side effects: http://www.mx.dk/nyheder/danmark/story/22213165 and http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/2015-06-09-syge-piger-paa-lange-ventelister-paa-hpv-centre

Personally, Im for the vaccine, because regardless of these side effects (and I do feel for those girls who have them) we have to remember that cervical cancer is a terrible disease that kills young women. But that doesnt mean we shouldnt try to figure out how to prevent serious side effects, or improve on the vaccine.
"
8853,And yet men still *can* get cancer (throat or anal) from HPV so shouldn't they be entitled to the same kind of vaccinated protection that women are? 
8854,"The amount of people with HPV is really high, I agree. However the amount of people that had a strand where genital warts are present is just a fraction of a percent "
8855,There's also a really good chance that it'll revert to subclinical in a year or two
8856,"Do you know anyone with bad HPV?

My friend gets warts on his junk, his fiancee just left him and he might have penis cancer; yes, *penis cancer*. Sounds pretty dramatic to me."

8866,">  If it was the other way around they'd be doing the same thing.

Yeah if it was the other way around they'd be saving costs... but are you serious?

If there was a vaccine being made available for free to boys only there'd be a massive public outcry, marching in the streets, people may even have gotten hurt.

But other way around, hardly a footnote."
8867,"100% agree with you. 

There are a bunch of reasons why I can see it being free for women:

First, HPV is by far most commonly transmitted through sexual activity. Second, if women are protected then straight men have are protected. Third, the effects of HPV on women are significantly worse for women. Fourth, the government is giving the vaccine free to gay men. Fifth, money is limited and unless you are arguing that we give EVERY GOD DAMN drug for free, a government has to look at the return on investment -- how much more benefit (the return) does the country get for doubling the cost (investment). 


I'm glad /r/worldnews redditors don't work in public policy. "
8868,"It's not a sensible public health decision when the vaccination rates for both sexes are 40% in priority age groups. For what you're suggesting to work you have to vaccinate almost everyone that isn't a heterosexual man, and that currently isn't the case. "
8869,"Except vaccinations are not 100% effective and those who emigrate to the country or cannot have the vaccine due to a pre-existing condition are still unprotected. Herd immunity is powerful, it's why EVERYONE was given the rubella vaccine, although the primary group at risk is pregnant women, giving it to everyone is more effective.

Also how are we supposed to reliably vaccinate gay men without forcing them to out themselves in a country where homophobia is still very much present? Sound easier to just give it to all men."
8870,">if every woman (and gay man) is vaccinated and immune,

That would be nice, yes.

I mean, it's never going to happen for a variety of reasons, but I guess we can just pretend."
8871,"No!!! It's these fucking womyn making all these decisions and risking our lives and our beloved penises...

Seriously, though. Herd immunity comes up in every anti-vax post. The principle applies here. I don't get the flu shot every year. (Immunocompromised) Neither do a lot of people, actually. But because some people are getting the flu shot - the people who are the most vulnerable for it, especially - the spread of it is not as bad as it could be! 

If you vaccinate every person with a vagina and a uterus, well, there you go. Anyone they have sex with is safe. "
8872,[deleted]
8873,Herd immunity is always good.  And I don't want throat and neck cancers
8874,"No shit, the point is to give it to them well before they become sexually active. Like when they are 6. Pretty sure the younger you go, the safer you are with regards to the chances of a human being sexually active. Does that sound rational to you? If not why so?"

8918,"My father has been with only my mother for 30 years and he recently was diagnosed with cancer in his throat. He has never smoked a day in his life, eats healthy, and enjoys all forms of exercise in the outdoors. It turned out that he had contracted HPV probably decades ago, and over time it turned into squamous skin cancer and throat cancer that could have killed him. He still has a lot of trouble eating many different kinds of food, because of his physical pain in his throat but also because the chemo changed his taste buds dramatically.
I believe the virus is encouraged for girls, especially young ones becoming sexually active, more because it can cause serious damage to reproductive organs, but the damage can be deadly for males as well. My father has had to go through extensive invasive treatments and I'm glad he's okay now but still the thought lingers. This is an incredibly common and very transferable virus that has the ability to be benign or deadly, which is twice as dangerous. Unknowingly spreading a virus that can turn into a fatal situation. 
Long story short, it is too obvious that everyone should be given this vaccine. "
8919,my doctor told me penile cancer too. and genital warts. so it's good for men. 
8920,"It does.    It protects against HPV strains that are seen with frequency linked to oral and throat cancers.   It may not confer perfect protection,  but that is the case for women  and cervical cancer as well."
8921,"Older men can also (rarely) get penile cancer from HPV. Circumcision advocates often cite prevention of penile cancer as a reason to circumcise infant boys, but if we have a *fucking vaccine* that seems like a better option to prevent it since it's not surgical and doesn't have the ethical problems of amputating little kids bits."
8922,We should go on a pussy eating strike until the vaccine is free. 
8923,"It's a good question.  There seems to *some* limited evidence, in the literature, that receiving the HPV vaccine can confer some amount of retro-active protection.  

But even if it did not, I would still recommend getting the vaccine.  Remember, the vaccine is effective against a number of HPV strains. So it can protect you against acquiring the strains of HPV (in the future) that you haven't gotten yet."
8924,"I encourage you to get the vaccine. As others have stated, there are multiple strains of HPV. If you have one type, you can still be completely protected from the others if you get the vaccine.

As for ""curing"" HPV if you have it, there's no proven way to do so. There is a small amount of anecdotal evidence that suggests getting the vaccine after contracting HPV may inhibit warts from developing further, or recurring after they've been removed. (That's how my doctor described it to me at least)"
8925,"Being a ""prude compared to most people"" does not mean you are safe...I have two friends who have HPV and both had 3 partners or less (one friend had only had 1 partner). There are a huge percentage (IIRC around 80%) of sexually active people who are carrying some strand of HPV. "

IIRC it is not the same as the skin wart ones, because there is no way to test if men have been exposed to it.

The ""cutoff"" for getting the vaccine is supposedly 26 years. Not because it is less effective chemically, but because of the chances of prior exposure.

He kept forgetting to mail my referral for a pap smear when I hit 18 (more like actively not doing it at all I think). Really, the only thing that jerk was good for was giving me my anxiety meds like candy.

I'm so happy with my current doc though, he started me on Gardasil with zero issues and was super happy that I asked for it at all and told me to call him whenever I might want to start birth control again and he'll send off a script to my pharmacy. He even did my first pelvic exam himself when I told him how hard it was to find an Obgyn that didn't have an 8+ month waiting period.

I've probably already been exposed to HPV, but have never had warts and this will protect me.

It reduces the risk of penile cancer, and oral cancer, and anal cancer in men who receive anal sex. These are relatively uncommon, so I don't think I'm saving my life or anything. But it's cheaper than a new phone and will give me (and future partners) some protection."
8943,"and still, if someone wants the vaccine they shouldn't be stopped from getting it unless there are health risks."

8950,[deleted]
8951,I think with HPV they're reluctant to get most people vaccinated because there's a fear that people already infected and receive the vaccine will lead to development of resistant strains. Most cases are subclinical. That's why they have age cutoffs. The medical community decided to specify that young women should receive it because of the cancer risk that they face. It's a pretty new vaccine so I'm sure it will be allowed to extend to young men after some time.

Further up there were some comments already stating that the likelihood for cancer for women due to HPV is higher then for males. Making it a more worthwhile investment then male only. If its 300€ per vacination that's going to be a lot of money in total and there are a lot of sicknesses that could be treated.

8955,"It has nothing to do with profits, it has to do with using taxpayer money to help the most amount of people. Since there's almost no risk of ""men who don't have sex with men"" getting HPV when women are vaccinated, it doesn't make sense to pay twice as much to vaccinate them all. If you are about to engage in risky sex then you can get the vaccine for free. I don't understand why this guy's getting downvoted so much when it's obvious from the perspective of cost-benefit analysis that it would make no sense to vaccinate everybody.  "

8960,"> HPV infection can cause men to develop anal, penile, and oropharynx cancer.

Based on this: http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-and-men.htm

> Although HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, HPV-related cancers are not common in men.

> Certain men are more likely to develop HPV-related cancers:

>   * Men with weak immune systems (including those with HIV) who get infected with HPV are more likely to develop HPV-related health problems.
>   * Men who receive anal sex are more likely to get anal HPV and develop anal cancer.

From what I've seen in this comment thread, the men in those 2 at-risk categories have access to the vaccine for free.  Outside of that group, it sounds like the CDC doesn't feel this is a common enough issue to warrant a national campaign.

"
8961,"I understand that, but given the fact that it is now offered to women (and at rick men), it doesn't seem like there needs to be an additional gov't backed cost. Those who are significantly at risk are able to protect themselves.

Additionally, HPV is much, much hard to transfer (you don't get HPV from simply being in close proximity to an infected individual) and significantly less lethal than things like Polio, TB, and even the common flu - all of which have strongly recommended/required vaccines. 

In my opinion, this is an issue more along the lines of using a condom.  If you want to have protection with a new partner, require your male partner to wear a condom. Yes, female condoms are available, but they can be harder to find and potentially more expensive (I know many places provide free or cheap condoms for both sexes, but it's not convenient for everyone to go to one of those places).

Throat cancer and anal cancers happen for everyone. And regardless, the vaccination rates in the 13-17 age group (where the first dose is recommended) is about the same at 40% for both sexes, meaning increased vaccination rates among boys or girls would reduce the risk of transmission for both."

Right.  But, of course, the entire point of kids getting the vaccine young is to get it before sexual activity occurs.  If you wait until they've started having sex, the risk is higher."
8970,It tends to be asymptomatic in *everyone* and greatly increases the risk of cancer at any site it infects.
8971,"Hi there, gay male checking in.

I contracted HPV and developed anal warts. After consulting a colon and rectal specialist and doing some tests, we discovered that they had become pre-cancerous. I had to have an expensive, extremely painful rectal surgery at the age of 22, that left me permanently scarred, unable to use the bathroom without shitting blood for months, and ashamed of my sexuality.

Because warts are a nuisance, right?

Sorry to sound a bit harsh, but it never would have happened if I had just gotten the vaccine. (I'm actually getting the full round of HPV vaccines now, as there are other strains that it protects against. There is also some anecdotal evidence that the vaccine can inhibit recurrence of warts if you've already been exposed.)

And yes, these warts can become cancerous on the penis as well. Furthermore, the concept of herd immunity applies to the HPV vaccine. All boys who plan on becoming sexually active should opt to get this vaccine because it protects themselves as well as any potential partners they may have. I'm tired of seeing the excuse you made - it belittles an actual problem that males face...it's a really shitty argument to make.

In males, there is no way to test for HPV unless you're showing visible symptoms (taking a sample of the wart tissue). Many males can be carriers and unknowingly spread it. This is another example of how homosexual males are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to sexual health planning. If boys don't get the vaccine young, they become ineligible after a certain age. This isn't a scenario that is considered by most people, but is definitely a real issue.

EDIT: To the people messaging me, saying that I *deserved* to contract HPV because of my unsafe and promiscuous behaviors, thanks for making those assumptions! I appreciate that, but I would like to point out that you can contract HPV even if your partner is wearing a condom."

8976,"HPV is significantly more likely to lead to cancer in females (cervical cancer specifically) but is also the majority contributor to cases of penile and anus cancers, and a significant contributor to the number of throat cancers in both sexes. Going by current US numbers about 6-7 times as many women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year as there are discovered cases of penile cancer.

But either way you look at it vaccinating people of both sexes will impede the spread of HPV to people of either sex, and potentially stop thousands more cancer cases per year. And as it currently stands the vaccination rate is roughly even between sexes regardless of the cost disparity. "

9022,">First, HPV is by far most commonly transmitted through sexual activity.

I'm not sure how I understand how this is a reason for why it's free for women.

>Second, if women are protected then straight men have are protected.

This only makes sense if all or the vast majority of women are protected, and if the vaccination is 100% effective, neither of which are the case. And if either isn't the case, vaccinating a larger number of men as well helps people of both genders. Currently roughly 40% of people of both genders in the 13-17 age range are vaccinated.

> Third, the effects of HPV on women are significantly worse for women.

At roughly 20,000 new HPV caused cancer cases in women, and 12,000 new HPV caused cancer cases in men, the majority of cases for both genders are from a combination of throat, anal, and various other cancers that both genders suffer from. The discrepancy mainly comes from the ~2,000 HPV caused penile cancer cases to the ~10,000 HPV caused cervical cancer cases. It's also worth noting that for most of these men have lower survival rates, including in the case of penile vs. cervical cancer. The main difference is HPV more commonly resulting in genital warts for women.

>Fourth, the government is giving the vaccine free to gay men. 

The government is, depending on state, giving the vaccine away for free to women aged 13 to 17-25 and men considered in high risk in the same age range. In many cases a gay boy wanting to get vaccinated would either legally or logistically required to tell their parents about their sexuality, or at the very least have figured their sexuality out by this age, which is not a given. 

>Fifth, money is limited and unless you are arguing that we give EVERY GOD DAMN drug for free, a government has to look at the return on investment -- how much more benefit (the return) does the country get for doubling the cost (investment).

You mean how every other developed country on earth makes vaccines considered important to at the very least children for free? And considering all the factors above, and the fact that vaccination rates are on par by gender as it is, meaning the cost doesn't seem to be a major factor in the vaccination rates, and at 40% (far below what it needs to be for female only vaccination to be effective for establishing herd immunity), why does it make sense for only girls to get the vaccine for free?"
9023,"That's not how the vaccination systems work. Cost-effectiveness is a main drive don't you realize? or are you asking for the private industry to provide the vaccines for free? If that's The case then by all means, fuck those guys and their profits, health shouldn't be sold for profit. But! If you're asking the public sector to provide them for free then I'm sorry that's not how it works, decision aren't based on a notion of ""equality"" but on evidence. The public vaccination programs that states around the world manage are based around cost-effectiveness. There's no reasonable scientific cost-effective reason to provide free vaccination to boys, for girls is demonstrably a must. Al least right know. It has absolutely nothing to do with ""equality"", that is complete nonsense and shows a lack of understanding of how those health systems work. The benefits of vaccinating boys does not outweigh the costs. It's as simple as that. It's the whole point of vaccination as a whole!!! Cost vs. benefits. 

"
9024,"Well, then pay for it.

I am somewhat sad that you do not understand how utility affects public health care decisions, but that does not change anything."
9025,"Perhaps the vaccine is less effective if given at 6, or is slightly dangerous to give that young, in the same way that you can't get the MMR before age 2 even though, of course, sometimes infants get measles, mumps, or rubella.

Very few children are sexually active at the age of 11 or 12, and I'd wager that most of those who are are, in fact, being raped - meaning that they might have been in danger of same at age 5 or 6 as well. Vaccinating at age 12 is perfectly reasonable."
9026,"My numbers were slightly off.  Most cases of HPV related cancer are cervix, vagina, and vulva.  Penis and mouth cancer are very rare.  Bumhole cancer is up there too, but it still only makes up a small percentage of HPV related cancers."
9027,"Almost certainly biological. It's a good question though, I'd like to see confirmation either way. Your original comment just came off like a joke, is all."
9028,"No, it isn't. This site is 100% anti-tumblr, there is a giant subreddit for making fun of it. One person voicing a different opinion than the usual stuff that gets posted here does not mean this site is suddenly tumblr."
9029,"Not cost effective.  Some things are limited to a sex or groups within a sex.  Males are lucky here as they are unlikely to be affected.

The vaccine should be available to those who are not high risk for serious side effects or complications, but that does not mean it should be subsidized for everyone."
9030,And where does the government get money?
9031,Much less commonly. That's why it isn't free currently. Do you think doctors just hate men?
9032,"Not really. If all girls are vaccinated, then they're not at risk. Afaik HPV doesn't do anything in males (or most females, but it is a common cause of cervical cancer)."
9033,"If women are vaccinated, they can't pass it on to men. Both get protected at a reduced cost."

9041,"There is no ""free.""

In time, hopefully the cost to manufacture/purchase the vaccine will lower, and the amount of people offered the vaccine can grow. But in the short term, there is growing pains. Its not a personal attack, its not a gendered issue, its really about what will make the biggest difference today. That doesn't mean that it will never change, just that, at this moment, this is what we can do."
9070,"The thing is with this drug that to be mostly effective it has to be given at a young age, hence why the school programs are mostly set around age 12 globally. You don't know who is gay or straight at that age, and really it shouldn't matter. Cost analysis project that it is actually cheaper to do mass vaccination than it is to treat HPV related outcomes (such as anal and oralesophageal cancers in men who have sex with men) are on the rise. 

PEI and Alberta have already done and proven these analysis in the Canadian context, and Australia and Norway have also incorporated boys into their school based funded program. 

I actually wrote a paper examining this in the Canadian context a few months ago and the main hold up in BC is politics. The investment is a good one, it is non-discriminatory and it is beneficial for the wellbeing of all Canadians as a long term health measure. Also if we could get the entire vaccination rate above 90% we could almost eliminate the 4 (soon to be 5) strains of HPV that cause the most harm from our population. That's worth it. "
9071,"Indeed. By only vaccinating women and gay men, the spread from gay<->gay stops, the spread from bi men<-> women stops and the spread from women -> straight men stops.

The only way straight men would be able to have it is if they have sex with an unvaccinated person. Herd immunity should stop the virus.

9080,For herd immunity it is generally accepted that you need at least 80% of a population to be vaccinated for it to work. 
9081,"And then you have the issue where this is real life, and the actual vaccination rates are ~40% for both eligible males and females. Also, no, that's not how herd immunity works. While there is cross-transmission between the homosexual and heterosexual populations, that is not responsible for a significant portion of transmission within the homosexual population, nor is it necessary to sustain the disease."

9083,"> If all females are vaccinated, then it becomes impossible for males to get it from intercourse from females

Except not all women will ever be vaccinated, and that while the vaccine is highly effective for some strains (90%+ IIRC) for select non-targeted strains there is effectiveness but much lower (60%). So it will hardly make it impossible for males to get it."
9084,"Like I said I can understand that money runs everything, but that doesn't just throw my comment out of the window. It's more ridiculous that money even comes before health in this modern day.

As for the sexism part, maybe it wasn't the best word to use but I still think that's it's fucking ridiculous. At the end of the day an illness is an illness. Whether or not it can be worse in females, it's still a BAD illness and some have actually lost their genitals because of HPV ( males ). So it doesn't matter.

Again, I'm pissed off. Maybe some stuff can be argued but everything boils down to: ""It's wrong to put money first. It's wrong to treat a BAD illness as more important in the opposite sex."" And if you think that it's fine then there is something incredibly wrong with this world. "

Now I'm getting a bit confused. The article, originally posted, is about the Canadian healthcare system. So are you saying that gay/bisexual men who engage in anal sex get the HPV vaccine for free in Canada, America, or both? I'm kinda leaning toward none of the above.


I think most of the vitriol involved in this is the sense that the health of men is not a priority, let alone a concern, ever. Not to mention the obvious preferential treatment based on sex. The risk of cancer that men face may be lower than women; however, I feel the concerns of men are still valid, especially as their lives may potentially be on the line.

9125,Don't bother....there's a circlejerk going on here driven by he male redditors that feel oppressed by such a government policy that On the surface appears to be benefiting only women. Your whole post was 100%.  We have limited resources to spend and there probably isn't enough gained in vaccinating at no cost 100% of the population when you can get similar results by vaccinations at no cost 50% of the population 
9126,"Only about 40% of either gender is vaccinated, so men don't have anything close to a herd immunity. Every guy vaccinated helps both genders unless we have almost complete vaccination rates in one gender. "
9127,"> I'm not sure how I understand how this is a reason for why it's free for women.


Each step I listed was painting a picture of the WHOLE situation. They weren't meant to be taken as individual points.  So in this case, it matters how it's transmitted because as I later said in my 2nd & 4th point), if women and gays are given the vaccine for free, then straight men have little chance of getting it.  Can the resources (billions of dollars, money is limited resource) better be used elsewhere? 


>This only makes sense if all or the vast majority of women are protected, and if the vaccination is 100% effective, neither of which are the case. And if either isn't the case, vaccinating a larger number of men as well helps people of both genders. Currently roughly 40% of people of both genders in the 13-17 age range are vaccinated.

Are you mandating the vaccine for everyone or even just for girls? If not, of course it won't be 100% but giving it for free to girls will greatly increase the number of women that get the vaccine and thus will greatly reduce the number of men that are exposed to HPV.  This post is about Canada but I didn't find the vaccine rates for Canada but in the US, [60% of girls 13-17 and 40% of boys 13-17](http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/07/30/cdc-hpv-vaccine-rates-are-up-but-not-high-enough) have the vaccine. If Canada is providing it free to women, you can expect to be much higher than 60%.  In fact this [report](http://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2013/10/04/ontario_asked_to_publicly_fund_hpv_vaccine_for_boys.html) indicates that vaccination rates for girls are 70% in 2012 and it was 59% in 2009. So now in 2015, it's likely a good deal higher than 70%.  



>At roughly 20,000 new HPV caused cancer cases in women, and 12,000 new HPV caused cancer cases in men, the majority of cases for both genders are from a combination of throat, anal, and various other cancers that both genders suffer from


The OP is about Canada. What is the US policy on HPV vaccines? Costs? 60% of girls 13-17 and 40% of boys 13-17 have had the vaccine in the US. So despite girls having 50% higher vaccine rate, they still have 66% higher rates of cancer. Clearly women are far more likely to get cancer than men. If my math checks out, girls are 2.5x more likely to get an HPV cancer than men. 

>In many cases a gay boy wanting to get vaccinated would either legally or logistically required to tell their parents about their sexuality, or at the very least have figured their sexuality out by this age, which is not a given. 

Gay men are at most 2% of the population. It will not have a huge impact on the overall effect of such a policy. Gay men can get the vaccine up to the age of 26 for free so they have plenty of time to get it. 


>You mean how every other developed country on earth makes vaccines considered important to at the very least children for free? And considering all the factors above, and the fact that vaccination rates are on par by gender as it is, meaning the cost doesn't seem to be a major factor in the vaccination rates, and at 40% (far below what it needs to be for female only vaccination to be effective for establishing herd immunity), why does it make sense for only girls to get the vaccine for free?

WTF are you going on about??? What country even mandates an HPV vaccine? Which country mandates or provides it for free to boys? Perhaps zero.  [Here](http://www.hpvaction.org/gender-neutral-vaccination.html) is a group advocating for free HPV vaccinations to both boys and girls and this is what it says: ""*Despite HPV’s impact on the health of both sexes, most countries’ HPV immunization programmes are exclusively for females. In the UK, girls aged 12/13 have been vaccinated routinely, mostly via a school-based programme, since 2008. Only the United States, Austria, Canada and Australia recommend vaccination for males as well. In 2013, Australia became the first country to implement a comprehensive vaccination programme for all boys aged 12/13.*""   

So only Australia recently included a vaccanation program for boys and only a handful of countries that include Canada even reccommend it for males. So no, most developed countries aren't providing it for free to boys.

>Cost analysis project that it is actually cheaper to do mass vaccination than it is to treat HPV related outcomes (such as anal and oralesophageal cancers in men who have sex with men) are on the rise.

>PEI and Alberta have already done and proven these analysis in the Canadian context, and Australia and Norway have also incorporated boys into their school based funded program. 

Have a source on PEI & Alberta? Did they actually show a savings? 

I know Australia recently incorporated boys into the program...not sure if it's also free like Canada for girls or if they are just including boy in the message.  


If what you are saying is true and well documented, then its a matter of time for that to be implemented in many countries. This is all very recent so it's no surprise that governments and their public policy people are gathering information before taking such a huge expensive step. 

 "
9163,"Hey...logic and reason!  If women and gay men get the vaccine, the straight men should be protected. The chances of a straight man getting HPV will be low and even if they get it, it usually doesn't affect men like it affects women.

9164,"> women -> straight men stops.

Except no one has achieved a high enough vaccination rate it girls.

It does....but then again...for the 1 millionth time i've said it in this thread, money is limited and unless you are arguing that we give EVERY GOD DAMN drug for free, a government has to look at the return on investment -- how much more benefit (the return) does the country get for doubling the cost (investment)

Although HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection, HPV-related cancers are not common in men.Certain men are more likely to develop HPV-related cancers:Men with weak immune systems (including those with HIV) who get infected with HPV are more likely to develop HPV-related health problems.Men who receive anal sex are more likely to get anal HPV and develop anal cancer.

So, it is possible, just much more rare (two out of three cases of cervical cancer are due to HPV, iirc). Bear in mind that before vaccination was a thing, most sexually active people got HPV. So apparently policy makers decided the risk in men wasn't great enough for free vaccination. $300 is a lot just for a vaccination, though."

9227,Same. Paid around $300 for mine because I was in University when they started giving them in schools. Would've been nice if it was even partially covered by insurance but nope.

9229,But this is for 11 year olds. How many 11 year old boys know for sure that they are gay and are willing to tell the world that they are? 
9230,Yeah if they're out at the age of 9-12.
9231,">Because it simply does not affect men and women in the same ways. Much the same way that estrogen treatments are not given to golden age men.


I'm pretty sure men don't need estrogen treatment, testosterone sure, but estrogen? Unless they're transgendered. Where were you going with that?


Anyway, thanks for being clear if nothing else. In short, fuck the needs of men. Gay, straight, bi, not a concern, par for the course unfortunately."
9232,Is that really correct? I've always heard the number was closer to 10%.
9233,"> No, there are roughly 20,000 new HPV caused cancer cases for women each year and 12,000 for men.

So....... correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't that mean that women are around twice as likely to suffer the effects of HPV than men? And are therefore a higher risk group?"
9234,"You can still get it from kissing, don't worry :)."
9235,"Correct, and correct.

Men are carriers of strains with no symptoms whatsoever. This was the prevailing thought when HPV was rolled out to girls. Again with the idea that older people (over 20 years old) have likely been exposed and it isn't worth it doing anything for them, since we can't test for it in men anyway.

Now we learn that these strains cause specific cancers later in life, in men.

So even from an altruistic standpoint, if you have available funds and an accommodating doctor, you can go get the vaccine if you are a man to at least try not to infect your poor women who would seem to be the victims here, and diminish your chances of getting specific cancers.

But it sucks because you'll probably die of lung cancer, heart attack or a car crash anyway.

Should just be a covered treatment."
9236,"*They should study MS0s who wash everything with polyhexanide, like me.*"
9237,"You track mortality rates from HPV and whichever demographic has the highest you target with programs. Pretty straightforward, I would think, unless multiple demographics are very close.

Anyways, 300 dollars for your health is not outrageously prohibitive unless you're living below the poverty line. I plan to get the HPV vaccine asap, especially after hearing some of the discussion in here."
9238,"If I was told that, I probably would have never had unprotected sex.

Instead, we had the ""Anonymous Question Box"" where students could write questions on an index card, drop it in a box, and the teacher would read them aloud the next day.

He had to toss out half the stack everyday due to all the smart ass questions. I thought I was hilarious when I asked him if girls had as many holes as a golf course.  "
9239,"You'll also get chlamydia, and die. "
9240,"Of course, but what are the kids going to reach for after you tell them they could get dick cancer? Condoms. They'll buy them by the armloads. They'll even use them when taking a piss in fear of the toilet seat.

Just a heads up, [KAREX seems to be doing pretty well today](http://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?ticker=KAREX:MK). Buy low and sell high and all that mess."

9250,"> Also, this is Canada, which means that every single person should have equal access to health care no matter their race, sex, or age

That's not how public policy works. Like at all. There are often lots of programs that 'discriminate' against certain groups. LOTS of programs.

9253,Umm that link contains an article saying the committee recommends vaccination for everyone at age 11 or 12. It also goes on to recommend women and men not vaccinated at that age to be vaccinated if they are under 26. So... Apparently your articles agree with the OP.

9257,"I think you are missing the point when there is a vaccine available to only 50% of the population for free when the other half has to pay $300, when most people live week to week $300 is saving for a month without no emergencies or financial hiccups. I can do it no prob, but average joe making 1/2 of what I make and has probably a mortgage, a kid, and other things to worry about now wants to get a vaccine for him and his little boy finds out its $600 he'll have to say hopefully a couple months down the road by then he'll surely forget and the child won't care because its a child."
9258,"I swear, this thread was just one big circle jerk ""why do women get this for free and not us oppressed men!"".  Everyone is downvoting the posts with logic and reason and upvoting all the reactionary comments like ""this is discrimination!"". 

There are a bunch of reasons why I can see it being free for women:

First, HPV is by far most commonly transmitted through sexual activity. Second, if women are protected then straight men have are protected. Third, the effects of HPV on women are significantly worse for women. Fourth, the government is giving the vaccine free to gay men. Fifth, **money is limited and unless you are arguing that we give EVERY GOD DAMN drug for free, a government has to look at the return on investment** -- how much more benefit (the return) does the country get for doubling the cost (investment). 


I'm glad /r/worldnews redditors don't work in public policy. "
9259,"Cancers.

I'm glad when talking about this we can say men get cancers, but females are at risk of Cervical Cancer.

Perhaps if you google a bit deeper beyond the HPV info for dummies, and read some studies, you could shape your opinion based on evidence and data. "
9260,And vaccinating women and gay men dramatically reduces the chances of men getting it too.
9261,Gardisil is also the evolved form of Gardevoir
9262,How does vaccine efficacy effect which group should be subsidized if the efficacy does not vary from one group to the other?

9266,"It depends on the virus. When you get a cold, once your immune system wipes it out, it's gone. (Your immune system remembers, but the virus itself is eradicated.) On the other hand, the herpesviridae (which includes e.g. the chickenpox) live inside your nerve cells forever and there's no known way to remove them. HPV seems to be somewhere in between, as far as I'm aware, but I don't know the details."
9267,"> 20,000 new cancer cases for women vs 12,000 for men.

Those are US cases. The OP is about Canada. What is the US policy on HPV vaccines? Costs?  60% of girls 13-17 and 40% of boys  13-17 have had the vaccine in the US. So despite girls having 50% higher vaccine rate, they still have 66% higher rates of cancer.  Clearly women are far more likely to get cancer than men. If my math checks out, girls are 2.5x more likely to get an HPV cancer than men. 

>I suspect the reason is less cost and more inertia. My prediction is that vaccination rates for men will increase as public policy adjusts

The subsidized price is $300 for boys in Canada. Let's assume the cost is $500.  So if you were to provide it free to all males in the US, that would be 160m x $500 = $80 billion on top of the $80 billion to provide it for free for women and gays. If women and gays get the vaccine, the chances of straight men getting it are slim. Can those $80 billion be better spend on some other program that provides much better return on investment? "
9268,"There are many things in society that we pay taxes for but never benefit from.  

There is still no justification for why we should double the cost of this vaccine just because someone sarcastically posts ""another gay disease"" on reddit.  We need facts and reasons, not emotional pleas and poor critical thinking skills."
9269,That's why they'll vaccinate gay men up to the age of 26.

9271,"> I'm pretty sure men don't need estrogen treatment, testosterone sure, but estrogen? Unless they're transgendered. Where were you going with that?

And this is what the CA gov't is saying about not at-risk men, ""You don't need it, so we're not going to pay for it."" That's how medicine works - you only take what is necessary.

> In short, fuck the needs of men. Gay, straight, bi, not a concern, par for the course unfortunately.

You can twist my words however you want, but that's not what I am saying.  Being gay, bi, or straight is a big issue because it directly affects the likelihood of an individual being affected.  Gays and bi's are at a high-enough risk to justify covering them - straights are not.


"
9272,Yeah it's a lot closer to %3-4
9273,"The actual number we have is 3-4%, however, personally I think it's higher."
9274,"Not around twice as likely. Doubling it to 24000 for men gives a 20% difference. That's not a good margin of error. It's 1.6 times, or 5/3. Closer to 1 and a half than double. "

oh just 14.5% of america... or only 45 million people.... lets divide that by 2 to give us our male population, grand total 22.5 million people that cannot afford this vaccine out of pocket indefinitely because of cost. Does that not seem like a problem to anyone!"
9277,"> Anyways, 300 dollars for your health is not outrageously prohibitive unless you're living below the poverty line.

"
9279,You can get HPV even with condoms. glhf
9280,"""For those who are sexually active, condoms **may lower the risk of HPV infection**. To be most effective, they should be used with every sex act, from start to finish. Condoms may also lower the risk of developing HPV-related diseases, such as genital warts and cervical cancer. But HPV can infect areas that are not covered by a condom - so condoms may not fully protect against HPV.""

9281,"Don't patronize me. I didn't whine. I saw I was being downvoted so I said that if people disagree with what I said (which is that penis cancer is extremely rare), then they should do some research. 

There's no circlejerk, but what happens is people read medical advice on the internet and then panic because the information is not accurate or incomplete. It doesn't help for people to say things like ""HPV can result in your penis being amputated"" because now you're going to have 15 year olds on here in a panic that their dicks are going to fall off if they get HPV. This is definitely an issue that we need to address and figure out, but scaring the shit out of uninformed people is counter productive.

edit: also, I didn't ""make any cogent point at all""? The poster above me asked a question. I responded. How is that not contributing to the conversation?"
9282,"No, you didn't. I don't see you saying anything about it being rare in your comment. The government isn't going to subsidize vaccination for extremely rare cases of cancer in boys. So, that logic to argue for the vaccination to be covered is not good. I can get on board with subsidizing it if we are saying that if males do not carry it, females will not contract it and end up with cervical cancer which is much more common."
9283,"No, but almost one in 5 is very statistically significant."
9284,This is certainly a concern as well.
9285,Source?
9286,"I didn't ask for those things, and no one has the right to force me to pay for them. That is theft.

The militia is the replacement for the military, the militia is the whole body of the people, any person willing and able to take up arms to protect freedom is a member of the militia. "
9287,"Very simple. Let's say you are a young woman who could not be vaccinated against HPV. You are at risk so long as you screw men who weren't vaccinated. You are much less at risk if you stick to men who were vaccinated (or women, but is it very transmissible that way?)

Therefore, herd immunity is a thing and you're being silly, amus."
9288,"Ah. Because one study of a drug might be wrong, it's all a big conspiracy.

Yuppers, better have women die of cervical cancer, just in case it isn't 100% safe because, you know, the Illuminati."
9289,"Not relevant, it's about a completely different drug. Come back when you have a peer review study that suggests significant negative side effects from the HPV vaccine."
9290,At decreasing effectiveness. You know why they have huge campaigns in the schools to get girls vaccinated early right? Its because its necessary in order to get an appreciable amount vaccinated. Boys are excluded from this even if they are in a higher risk group.
9291,Hm. Didn't know that. Thanks!
9292,"Of course it seems like a problem, but if each vaccine is worth 300 dollars I think you can understand that saving 6 billion dollars (using your numbers) sounds attractive given that generally the major life altering problems caused by HPV affects women."
9293,"Yeah. No shit. Condoms lower the risk of anything condoms lower the risk for, such as STD's and Pregnancy.

This isn't news."
9294,"You denounced the comment as being typical of a certain trend rather than arguing specific points. Your argument didn't seem to be ""this person is wrong and here is why"" it seemed to be ""this person is wrong, just like everyone like them"" which is not a logical argument.

As far as your now explained point, I would say it could just as easily cause those 15 year olds to do research into HPV and make an informed decision themselves. Saying that it's *just* fear mongering (and not explaining further) seems like it could just have the opposite effect and cause them to not give a shit at all."
9295,"Look again, I commented twice. I never said that I think the government should subsidize it, sorry if there was confusion. But I do think all boys and girls need to be educated on HPV and everything it can cause"
9296,"Not in this specific comment chain, but in another comment in reply to Raidicus they did."
9297,"I wouldn't argue that, just the terminology /u/dmoore2694 used."
9298,"It is implied because you took up residency there.  Go find your own land to lay claim that isn't already part of a Nation.  If you don't pay taxes then YOU'RE committing theft of land and infrastructure you had no role in making.

Except a militia will never be able to compete with an army funded by a government due to unity of purpose, and resources.  It is an inferior product that attempts to denigrate it's betters so it may compete, where it could not naturally."
9299,Don't be daft. I know what herd immunity is and this converstion has nothing to do with it.
9300,"I find your comment a cheap response. Conspiracy as you think it means is wrong. It was a way for abusers to discredit whistleblowers and scientist who didn't accept the official narrative. Also, the illuminati is an old group long past. While the vaccine does work, it has loads of side effects. If the company invested a little more, they could fine tune it. Also, its very unethical to hide side effects and aggressively attack anyone that challenges a product. Reviews help make products better. It's hard to boycott a necessity to pressure a company to be better. "
9301,"It shows that the researchers behind the shit are bought. They are evaluated by the same corrupt system. Do you need shit in your hand to know something is wrong, or is the smell of poo enough to know something stinky is going on? If someone pays you for an answer so they can start making money, you most likely are going to give them the answer they want.

Well not you specifically, but if money is more important than ethics then you give answers that pay, if you don't, they'll just find someone who will. If you challenge them, you'll get sued or killed."
9302,This is a prime example of why many people believe healthcare shouldn't be a business to begin with.
9303,"so why not save even more by treating both? i saw another poster say 1/3 of hpv related cancer cases are men, sure not the majority but still a large enough number to matter?

EDIT If we saved $6b then it should be no problem instituting the vaccine for males because we saved so much that you could literally buy 20 million doses and donate them to  that cannot afford them. So now you are saying preventative care that is supposed to be affordable and accessible is only that to a certain class of people, those above the poverty line. 

EDIT EDIT: if you don't understand how you are saving more $ by vaccinating all then you aren't looking at the big picture, if we can get rid of a risk of cancer in group A and in group B even though the cancer effects group B more frequently why should we ignore group A? in the long run you are saving a lot of OR time which is about 1600-4500/hr, hospital recovery time (about 1200/night). Before you walked out the door to get your cancerous genital warts removed you already racked up $10k in bills, with no way to pay them back because you or your parents couldn't afford the shot. So now you become bankrupt because a $300 shot was just too expensive. So now the hospital eats the cost and now your credit is wrecked, good luck getting a house, car, loan, in the next 7 years.  So now that the hospital eats the cost it is then forwarded on to the state who then pays for it with those hard earned tax dollars we are so frivolous about. how about instead spend the tax money on $300 shots"

I'm for vaccines, but I think people should be better educated, and companies should have better products before releasing them... yea if you tell people there is a chance they will get screwed by the vaccine, they won't take it. It's like displaying the probability a gambler will win during a poker hand, the gambler will fold if the risk is high, but if he's feeling lucky and doesn't know, then he'll go for it.

However, there is not a group of people who can rightfully say they own 3.8 million miles of land. These groups, called government and bankers, are not using this land, they are just claiming that it is theirs and using violence to collect extortion fees from the people who do own it. If you understood property rights, you would never stand for this violence."

I was there first, I am using it, I live there, I defend it, if you want to steal it, you will have to go through me. The same applies to the Federal government. They don't live in my house, so they have no right to demand I pay them extortion fees. They are using intimidation and violence. You can't wear my clothing or drive my car against my will or you will be met with appropriate force. You are trying to make this more complicated than it is. If you were born in my house, and you have lived there your whole life, then the situation is different. I do not have the right to take your life, but I could ask you to stay out of the area that I am using and responsible for. And if you insist on trespassing into my area, you will be met with appropriate force. We would have to share certain areas of course, like the hallway or front door, because we also have the right to travel.

1) You will NEVER get 100% vaccination. Some people can't be vaccinated for medical reasons, others will just fall through the cracks. E.g. poverty and routine preventative medical care don't always go together. Even when poverty isn't a factor, some parents are just flaky and/or stupid...

2) It's rare, but some people will get vaccinated, and not develop immunity. The human body is an amazing and varied thing that doesn't do what we expect all the time. 

3) In general those who are not immune are protected in large part by ""herd immunity.""

But, intentionally having about ~50% of the population non-immune  sounds like a crappy way to achieve ""herd immunity"""

Didn't want to be a carrier to infect women (who would ideally be my own age and never vaccinated either). Also there's the penile cancer thing that I'd like to not contract. Didn't even for a second consider a throwaway because all of you have HPV too. Just cryo'd the shit out of my warts and I think I have them licked!

9338,There is no test for HPV in men....so how the heck do they know its actually working? short of seeing physical signs.
9339,Does no one consider Jenny McCarthy's feelings about this?
9340,"Cervical cancer prevention has been one of the chief reasons why it has been recommended that girls get vaccinated for hpv. Well how the hell do you think the hpv gets up in there? Cocks! This has been so stupidly drawn out over these past few years. And while so much focus has been put on cervical cancer, hardly anything has been said about the penile, anal, and throat cancers that hpv can cause in boys. Getting this hpv vaccine to everyone affected by the virus has been a fucking shit show from the very start. And if you're in your late twenties, you're banned from getting the vaccine. It's complete bullshit. So if I'm a 30 year old unvaccinated virgin who marries another 30 year old unvaccinated virgin who never shows any symptoms of having vaginal hpv, yet has it, we could potentially be screwed because we're too old to get vaccinated. Ten years from now I've got throat or penile cancer for bullshit reasoning. If there's a vaccine out there that can protect people from all of the cancers associated with hpv, let all of the people who can be affected by it get the fucking vaccine!"
9341,The HPV vaccine has a quite high amount of adverse reactions. Several doctors I've talked to have recommended AGAINST the vaccine at the current time unless you have a specifically high risk.
9342,It was part of my kids vaccination schedule to enter middle school.  I thought this was already a thing.
9343,in b4 vaccine circle jerk
9344,These comments sound like they were written by the vaccine company. 
9345,This is bullshit -- driven not by science or concern for public health but by pharmaceutical company profit.  
9346,I talked with my 12 year old (he's 13 now) and told him why I was having him vaccinated against HPV. He agreed that it would be better and he went in willingly. I will do the same thing when my younger son comes of age. 
9347,i went to my doctor at 31 and he said it wasnt worth it at that point. I dont know what to believe. 
9348,What about men? Can I get one still?
9349,My highschool had us all get that when we were in grade 7.
9350,"Sucks that I'm basically too old to get it (and insurance won't cover it), because IMO this is a no-brainer. The vaccine doesn't hurt me, HPV doesn't really hurt me, but if I get the vaccine it means I can't spread it to anyone else. It's so simple. I can't fathom why literally everyone doesn't get it.

Oh, right, because HPV is transmitted sexually, and Republicans can't stand the idea of decreasing the risks women take on when they have sex. "
9351,"Woah woah woah, but I've gotten my HPV series and I'm a guy. And my insurance covered it. I didn't even know it was something only recommend for females, I just knew it was free"
9352,"I'm so glad I got it. I remember when a girlfriend I was dating found out she had it. It clears up in time, but you can't test for it in guys so you never know where you stand. The vaccine still only covers the four most prevalent strains. "
9353,I thought this was already a thing. My son got his shots 2 years ago when he was 12...
9354,A little hpv never hurt nobody
9355,I'd rather have HPV then autism s/
9356,Oh that sounds awful! I did the series of shots a few years ago and it wasn't any more painful than I say a flu or meningitis shot (i can't remember too many more shots). No weird face heat or vise feeling. I wonder why you reacted in that way.

9358,"Finally, they listened to me from 11 months ago!

""Right, but it DOESN'T MATTER if you already have it or if the person you are already with has it. It also doesn't matter IF THE PERSON THAT THINKS THEY GOT SCREENED FOR BECAUSE THEY ASKED FOR AN STD SCREENING AND DIDN'T GET SCREENED FOR IT AT ANY TIME OF THEIR LIVES.

The HPV situation with existing people in your lives... It's like trying to take a flu vaccine AFTER you get the the flu.. it just can't work. That's not how the immune system works.

Please keep in mind that HPV is NOT COVERED UNDER STD SCREENING. So remind yourself and every single person that you plan to be with that you need to specifically request for your doctor to test specifically for HPV and not STDs when screening for HPV. If you ask for STD screening, you will notice on your medical records that HPV was not included.

Much like the flu vaccine this year, even the CDC states that it doesn't even have a 30% success rate for protecting against the flu strains that are out there.

You need to understand that cervical cancer needs to be prevented with HPV screening and vaccination as a mandatory practice for women and men alike. That's the only way to prevent from spreading around like wildfire."""
9359,"I don't get it, I got this vaccine years ago, why is this news? "
9360,"I thought the hpv vaccine was pretty standard for males now is it not? When I was in 6th grade (2006) I was given it as part of a regular well visit, and as far as I know all of my male friends from the same age group also were given it.

Edit: I also remember around the same time a lot of commercials for hpv vaccines, haven't seen any recently though.

Edit 2: Why the down votes? :\ I was genuinely unaware that it was uncommon for males to not be vaccinated for hpv in their teenage years, it was extremely common when I was a teen in New York "

9389,And gay men! Even 100% immunization of females does nothing for our community.
9390,"It was because most of the serious risks associated with HPV are to women. The cost of the vaccine is not trivial. You might notice someone also did the math on adults over a certain age -- the vaccine was never recommended for ALL women, nor is it currently recommended for ALL men."
9391,"It's because ~90% of the potential vectors for girls are boys, and ~90% of the potential vectors for boys are girls. If you only vaccinate the girls, you'll still protect about 90% of the boys, while saving a bit of money."

I got a physical in October and my doctor told me I should start the round of vaccinations because they would cover it until I'm 27. I turn 27 later this month but they gave me the first 2 (of 3) shots with no cost to me (but I will turn 27 before the last shot). 

From what I've read (only a little), it doesn't matter how long you wait before getting the third shot (no need to restart at the first shot). I'm also not sure how much getting only 2 of the 3 shots would help me, so I haven't decided yet if I will go back for the third shot in a few months (but cost would be another factor to consider).

Anyway, just ask your doctor about it because you may be covered. I'm glad my doctor was already on top of it and knew I could get the shots."

9424,Does a vaccination do anything if you already have it? It's probably a dumb question but I am going with saying there are no dumb questions when it comes to sex education. 
9425,"If you already have it, the vaccine isn't going to do anything."
9426,Ask your doctor if the HPV vaccine is right for you.
9427,What? How the hell does this have seven upvotes. HPV is a real public health concern despite whatever crazy anti-vaccine blog you read says. It causes a life-threatening cervical cancer in women and by vaccinating young men as well allows herd immunity as well as protecting against a lesser risk of oral cancers in both sexes and bonus protection against gential and anal warts.
9428,It depends on the number of sex partners you've had sex with. It's all about the probability that you have already been exposed. If you have not been exposed to one or several of the HPV strains included in the vaccine you still have use for the vaccine. If you've had few sex partners it's probably still worth getting the vaccine. It's important to take all three shots if you are vaccinated after your early teens though. This is since kids have a stronger antibody response to the vaccine and hence can get by with two shots if the shots are properly spaced. 
9429,"Theoretically, but it would probably take some work and you'd almost certainly be paying out of pocket. If you're over a certain age (27 IIRC) it's likely you've already been exposed to several, if not all, of the strains they vaccinate for limiting the effectiveness of the vaccine and even your doctor would probably recommend against it. "
9430,"> The amount of people this vaccine saves from getting cancer (note people do not necessarily die from cancer) does not outweigh the amount of people that it makes severely ill for life.

I know I am just pissing in the wind, but I just can't stop myself...

I had HPV in my 20s. By the time it was diagnosed (despite regular pap smears and me being engaged/only with one guy for several years), it had progressed to carcinoma in situ. I had to have several painful procedures to remove all the cancerous cells. 

After, I had to get Pap smears every three months for the next 10 years to make sure the cancer didn't return. And, each time I got pregnant, I had to worry about cervical incompetency. We lost a baby at 18 weeks, which I would not wish on *anyone.* 

So when you say ""people do not necessarily die from cancer"", you are being so very stupid. You do not have to die to have your life derailed by this virus. 

I vaccinated both my son and daughter. There's no way I want either of them to go through what I went through. "

[Quadrivalent HPV Vaccination and Risk of Multiple Sclerosis and Other Demyelinating Diseases of the Central Nervous System](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2088853)

As I understand it, what made people suspicious was that the girls coming down with MS were so young and that these diseases are rare in young girls. When they compiled the tables in this study they grouped the ages 10-29 and 30-44. That just stuck me as so counterintuitive. By going all the way up to 29 you mix in a swath that is well within the usual onsets of mid twenties and older.  Also, the vast majority of the vaccines were giving to teens. 

Wouldn't the 10-20 age group be the most important to look at? "

9449,"We do. Even in your abortion-loving Planned Parenthood-ruled dystopia, where kids get sex ed in school, the first thing taught is that the only truly safe sex is no sex at all.

Now, I assume you simply overlooked the part where a person may be monogamous with one partner and then years later have another monogamous relationship and still manage to pass along the HPV to that person. I know, right? Crazy!

So, yes, it's probably not my place to say, as I'm no epidemiologist, but vaccinating the #1 spreaders of the the fucking virus might, in fact, be wise."

9464,"Yeah, doctors have been saying this for years"
9465,"It's a misconception anyway.  Data is now showing that oropharyngeal cancer rates associated with HPV are on the rise for all genders.  There's no clear cause yet, but the base assumption is that people are just having more oral sex with more partners.  HPV is the most common STI.  Even if we're not 100% clear on why those rates are rising, we are clear that they ARE rising.  And who knows, it may be that it's just being identified more frequently and it has always been a problem.  Regardless, the idea that women are more impacted isn't correct anymore, and perhaps hasn't been for a while. "
9466,">It was because most of the serious risks associated with HPV are to women. 

You realize that does not counter his point about herd immunity, right?  If men are carriers, herd immunity due to them also being vaccinated is going to further decrease risk to women, not all of whom will or can be vaccinated, and some of whom will not develop immunity even if vaccinated."
9467,Because why care about men getting penile or throat csncer because of hpv when women are more at risk? I bet if they were excluding women even though they aren't as big of a risk people would be up in arms over the sexism. 
9468,"While sound reasoning, the real reason is HPV is usually harmless to boys. And people still have irrational fears of vaccines and won't get them if there isn't a clear benefit to themselves. 
Edit: changed to usually because it can cause cancer in men, but most people don't take that into account so I think the point stands "
9469,Get out of here with your reasoned explanations!
9470,"Except that only works with very high immunization rates and no country or state has shown that they have been able to reach that immunization rate.

Such that if you take a realistic immunization rate for the US the vaccine should be given to both boys and girls, if it isn't a huge portion of the guys will contract it regardless."
9471,"It is perhaps harmless, but if you get it, it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to pay for treatment. I don't know how much influenza costs. 

Also, is this a world wide statistic or the states? That seems like a lot for the states. For cost effectiveness assessment, we need to look only at the US. "
9472,"In this case, no. HPV comes with a lot more risks and complications in women than it does for men. If you or I get it (assuming you're also a guy) it's likely to not be as big of a deal."
9473,"I'd say throat cancer is pretty bad, but what do I know? I just played a doctor in an infomercial once."
9474,Get the third shot.
9475,"Good to know. I have not looked into my insurance as my son is only 1 year old, but it is nice to know that he should be covered for the vaccine when he is old enough."
9476,Probably from the biopsy results.  The analysis would show the viral DNA in the tumor.
9477,That would be called biopsy. 
9478,"Research shows that it is lagging behind. Anne Schuchat, MD says >""We think the principle road block is providers not recommending the vaccine""


There is no data in the article or the attached study indicating it is the physicians not recommending it.


How about making it mandatory. The second you tell a parent it is an optional vaccine a lot of them tune out.  I agree some physicians don't push it but if want it given like other vaccines treat it like other vaccines. "
9479,"Essentially because the vaccine is expensive, and HPV is more easily contracted by women. Furthermore, the HPV vaccine is essentially eradicating cervical cancer.

It's a risk assessment. Girls get more benefit. Obviously the vaccine is recommended for boys, but the focus is on girls because that's where we see the most benefit."

9501,"It would be like college, it just specifies ""up to date"".  If you start the Hep B string before entering college they don't care."
9502,"Pretty typical. The hard part is that it happens when kids are older. Most vaccines have several doses but happen when they are babies or toddlers. 

Even if they only get 1 shot, it still can provide a good chance of being protected. The boosters are to ensure that it takes hold. Not everyone needs three shots, but we don't know who needs three and who doesn't. So we give 3 in the best case scenario. If we don't, we still have an increase in coverage. "
9503,Not if they're administered by the school
9504,"Just got my first shot, it's 2 months to the second, then 4 months from there to the third and last."
9505,"You have to look at the relative risks and benefits. For instance, the risk of serious side effects vs. the risk of cervical cancer.  When a vaccine becomes approved, you can be sure the risks have been studied in depth and found to be an enormous win."

9517,So those STD's wouldn't be passed on to their children? What happens when their children have sex?
9518,"Yes it hurts a little and you have to get it in three rounds (or at least my type of vaccination was three shots). It's in your arm though, not your dick. A dick shot sounds horrible."
9519,Yes and no. It won't mitigate or cure you of the strain you have but it can prevent you from getting ~~any~~ 4-9 other strains depending on the vaccine and the strain you have.
9520,"Pssscht! I don't know. The first Planned Parenthood person told me it would help me fight off the virus and in the pure definition of a vaccine, that is true. But I've also seen literature that says the opposite for this particular vaccine. But, there is also a chance I do not have one of the four strains the vaccine prevents in which case, this vaccine would certainly do something."
9521,That's not exactly true.
9522,There are over 100 strains of HPV. The vaccine that men are allowed to take protects against 4 of the more dangerous strains. The vaccine might have helped me in some way.

9542,Ah well I just read somewhere that the CDC is expanding that recommendation to include boys
9543,[deleted]
9544,"Well, the CDC has been recommending it for men since 2011. I suppose it makes sense that people might not be aware of the benefits for men, but the medical community certainly has been aware of that for years; and telling the public about it.

My understanding was that the push for women to get vaccinated was because they are at greater risk for infection, and the associated cancers."
9545,"Illinois here, I (male) was vaccinated when I was around 14"
9546,"The chance that the vaccine would have covered the strain you have now is slim.  There's a newer one that covers some of the wart-causing strains, but the older vaccine covered the cancer-causing strains that were very unlikely to cause warts or any other symptom."
9547,I always found it to be strange that they only offered the vaccine to girl.
9548,It's stupid expensive now. I got it a year ago. 3 trips of $180 each or something like that.
9549,I tried in college and they wanted to charge me hundreds.

9554,I thought it was obvious enough from my comment that herd immunity is not the goal.
9555,"Well yeah, obviously. It doesn't matter though, because many places were giving the vaccination to women for free but charging men. That's where the real problem is. "
9556,"It's about the bottom line, not some sexist bias. The frequency of symptomatic and serious disease from HPV (and cost of treating those diseases) is higher in women. 

It would be just as dumb to whine about ""Why care about middle aged people getting HPV when most of them are already exposed or not at risk?"""
9557,Throat cancer is a big deal. 
9558,"That makes no medical sense.  A vaccine isn't a cure.  The whole point of a vaccine is to create herd immunity, not individual immunity.  As we have seen recently with the idiotic anti-vax people in the USA, pulling a sizable number of people out of the pool of vaccinated people effects everyone."
9559,"Anal cancer isn't a walk in the park, either."

Perhaps i should rephrase.  Girls got more attention because cervical cancer was more prevalent and discussed than other cancers"
9561,"Thanks, there is so much information out there, it is hard to filter it all. Now at least I can start doing searches based on that. "
9562,This is brought up very often. It's a good point and a good question. Sometimes a mandatory tag actually backfires with vaccines and you create more distrust. It's all P.R. at this point (which I'm no expert in)
9563,"Men are as likely to get hpv in their lifetime as women are it's just that men don't show symptoms as much, getting cancer is less likely and there is no test for hpv in men."
9564,Not only expensive but after it was developed it's not like there was immediately an unlimited supply. Might as well give it to the population at greater risk of deadly disease first. 
9565,"The new vaccines cover throat and anal cancer as well. The early HPV only covered cervical. 

The more recent versions of the vaccine (within the last year or so) cover cancers that boys can get, too. "

9571,"Right, because HPV is the only thing to worry about if you have unprotected sex. /s"
9572,"Tell her not to worry, a healthy fear of HIV will keep your daughter from agreeing to sex just as easily."
9573,"Why the fuck is sex so taboo with all the advancements we've made and access to information that wehave.  It's essential for humanity to continue as a species.  We're biologically supposed to be feeling those feeling around ~16.  People have be trying to stop sex for centuries and it has never worked (at least not without doing things that are now criminal). 

When I was 16 and had a girlfriend my mom sat me down and gave me condoms (I'd already had the birds/bees talk when I was like 10-11).
  
She said, *I absolutely don't want you to use them until you're older but I don't want to be a grandmother yet even more.  You and Cynthia be smart about this.**  Handed me the box and then left.  That box went unused until I was around 17 (not for my lack of trying).

I'm 29 now and when I eventually have kids I absolutely want both my male/female offspring to be vaccinated HPV or any other disease.  They're gonna have sex anyway, may as well make it as safe as possible. "
9574,"It's really interesting that parents have this train of thought. 

My kids have had all of their vaccinations for all kinds of diseases, and they don't go to ""Ok I'm protected now, I'll start doing things that will get me sick and rub up against people with measles""

You get the shot, then you forget it. It's not a big deal. 

Unless, of course, one makes it a big deal. "
9575,"Used to date a girl who said ""when I have kids I'm not going to vaccinate them""...that was when I realized we probably wouldn't work out.

Bullet dodged"
9576,"A vaccine that eliminates risks that come from your daughter having sex with more men than just her husband, will in fact, make it less risky for your daughter to have sex with more men than just her husband (who in the idealized situation, has never had sex with any other woman).

So, yes, it's true, the more materially obvious negative consequences you take away, the more likely an action will be done without fear of those negative consequences.

Absolutely.

But your wife and yourself should just get around to accepting that it is overwhelmingly likely she'll be sexually active by 15 or 16, and have about 10 different sexual partners in her lifetime, with the last one being the one she marries,  if she marries at all, given trends on marriage, too.

That's just how it is.

Edit: I'm not anti-vaccine, I just want more data than what is out there. Also, open book data where I can easily find it."
9583,"I think the opposite might be true. I'm not fear mongering but stating I have concerns. I don't want to be the guinea pig to those concerns.
I think the drug companies are fear mongering. They are implying that it saves you as a person and you won't get cancer but it's a herd vaccine (which I have never heard of before). I'm not anti-vaccine but anti-let's make the drug company not lose their shirt while we figure out if this causes some serious problems. The one study said that there were twice the complaints for one of the vaccines than another vaccine which causes them some concern. I'm just a reader and try to sift through your bullshit.

9592,Would it help prevent the appearance of warts again? 
9593,"I've spent a good bit of my career trying to understand people like you. If you read through some of my post history (and I do have one), you'll see that many of my posts are about polarization. 

I've learned that people reject vaccines because their brain structure is different. They have a subconscious set-point, and they go out looking for conscious facts to support their foregone conclusion. And, they post (often daily) on boards like this one because, each time they write lengthy paragraphs (which they then re-read and admire), they experience the [backfire effect](http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/06/10/the-backfire-effect/).

9599,"If one person in a 5,000 person study exhibits symptoms during the study, they have to report it as a potential side effect even if it's likely not caused by the drug in question. Are there potential side effects to the HPV vaccine? Yes, but the chances of getting any of them is tiny. The benefits absolutely outweigh the risks."
9600,"For a while the CDC had noted on a couple of their vax entries the savings for insurance companies and corps that had paid sick leave being a significant argument in favor of flu shots, etc., but it's more difficult to find these, or if you do, they've been re-written."

I sit there and think, ""Ah, whatever, sure. I'm in my late 20's, I can take a fucking needle in the arm.""

Holy shit was I wrong. That was the most painful vaccine I've ever gotten. I never faint from blood or needles, but I came damn close. My face got all hot and my arm felt like it was caught in a metal vice. I nearly did pass out and the nurse had to bring me a cute little juice box.

The best part is that was only the first shot. There's three in total and they get more painful.

I took the cowardly way out and never asked for the next two."
9613,"I always thought the initial decision to not recommend this for men was stupid.  If you want to stop the spread of a disease's effects by preventing a disease from spreading further, you need to target the entire vulnerable population, not just half of it "
9614,"> I suppose it makes sense that people might not be aware of the benefits for men

So here, you've answered your own question, ""Who's overlooking that?"" I think it's quite obvious that a lot of people associate HPV concerns with women much more than with men"
9615,[deleted]
9616,Depends on your insurance. 
9617,The price has always been that way. Campus health and health departments both typically subsidize it massively and insurance makes it cheap if you're in the approved demographic (I think age 9-26).
9618,Red state?
9619,"I got it at the health department (Indiana) and I only paid $15. This was over five years ago but $800 sounds ridiculous!
"
9620,"Ya, because by that age, only a small percentage of the population hasn't been exposed. 

I think you can get a titer to get an exception, with some insurances. "
9621,"Yes, cervical cancer is also a risk.  But HPV causes oral and rectal cancer, as well as penile cancer.  Perhaps the number of infections that convert to penile cancer is lower, I don't know... But simply by virtue of the number of parts that can be infected and turn to cancer, men and women are equal."
9622,"Yes, but you see, in dialogue, especially when rebutting someone's point, one should directly address one's opponent's point. In this case, /u/kfitch42 was questioning *WHY* herd immunity wasn't a goal, seeing as it is necessary to prevent the serious health risks to women.

Answering that it's because most of the serious health risks are to women really rather misses the point: if you're serious about reducing those health risks, one should vaccinate everyone."
9623,"No, it's not. Young women and girls are the **most** at risk.

If they only have X amount of vaccines to give away, because *someone* has to pay for the supplies (the government), who do you give them to? The people most likely to be affected, and those who would *be* affected the most (complications due to HPV affecting women more than men, in this case).

I'm not saying immunizing more people is a *bad* idea, I'm saying that not prioritizing who needs the vaccine when there's a limited supply of free ones is a bad idea."
9624,">It's about the bottom line, not some sexist bias.

There is some sexist bias, just look at the preventive care that women get compared to men under Obamacare.  More so notice how prostate cancer screening is not covered, but breast cancer screening is?  "
9625,"Also, IIRC, the first HPV vaccines were only for cervical cancer. They have since developed vaccines that cover a wider range of viruses. 

Also, the vaccine is relatively new, so it took some time be sure that it worked before expanding it out to everyone. "
9626,"Using that logic there should be no problems with women being paid less than men for the same work because paying women less saves companies money.

The world would be a hell of a lot more unequal if ""the bottom line"" was the deciding factor for pushing for equality."
9627,"Sure is. Thankfully, you're chances of getting it from HPV is very small. *Much* smaller than a woman's chance of getting cervical cancer from HPV."
9628,"Because women don't give hear, am I right??? Guys???"
9629,"I might be mistaken, but I'm fairly sure men's chances of even contracting it are much lower as well. Not to mention it's sexually transmitted, so comparing it to the whooping cough outbreak in California, I believe it was, is nonsensical. Immunizing young girls and women, by extension, creates the herd immunity for men. Women can't contract it to pass on to men (Lower chance anyways), and then men don't have it to pass on to immuno-compromised women."
9630,Why did you delete your original comment? Did you realize how ignorant it sounded?
9631,"still sucks when you do show symptoms and have to go get warts lasered off your ass.  I'm still a little angry at a doc 6 or 7 years ago who wouldn't give me the shot, then having to go through that a couple years later to the cost of $7000 out of pocket."

9636,"> It's essential for humanity to continue as a species. We're biologically supposed to be feeling those feeling around ~16. 

Because that's when evolution is trying to make them procreate, too.

You can't really say that the natural urges of sex in adolescence mean sex should be had in adolescence, and also with artificial  technological intervention in natural procreation, if you're also going to argue against artificial social intervention in natural sexual urges.

A religious mandate for women not to be loose, and a condom are both ultimately the same thing: 

Unplanned children and disease = bad

stable families and children = good

sex = children/possibly diesease, unless you rigorously plan when/why/how you have sex

It's two different approaches to the same issue
"
9637,"Stopping sex 100% of the time may not have worked, but surely it's worked at least SOME of the time.  Just because no one's ever been able to prevent all kids from getting hit by cars doesn't mean we shouldn't try to teach them to look both ways before crossing.

But also give them protection so that if they DO cross without looking at least they're wearing a condom when they get hit by that car."
9638,Expired condoms can lead to pregnancy.

9739,"Edit: I was on mobile and didn't read your sources. Our sources agree on cancer death rates, although I'm having a hard time rectifying the death rates with cause of mortality. 

The prevalence for prostate cancer was historically higher, but as of 2015, more women are diagnosed with breast cancer than men diagnosed with prostate cancer. 

Breast cancer occurred in 231,840 women in 2015 and caused 40,290 deaths 17.3% lethality. 

Prostate cancer occurred in 220,800 men in 2015 and caused 27,540 deaths; 12.4% lethality. 

Additionally, prostate cancer screenings of the general population have been shown to not improve death stats and probably cause a lot of unnecessary surgery; often, prostate cancer is slow growing. 

One important point relevant to the comment thread is this, from your American Cancer Society page. 

> Death rates from breast cancer have been declining since about 1989, with larger decreases in women younger than 50. These decreases are believed to be the result of earlier detection through screening and increased awareness, as well as improved treatment.

It unfortunately doesn't seem to be the case that earlier detection of prostate cancer improves the outcome universally, and would cause a lot of unnecessary prostate removals.

9740,"You do not need to have anal sex to get anal cancer. And you do not need to have oral sex to get throat cancer. It does increase your chances, but doesn't cause it necessarily. If you get that form of HPV from any kind of sexual contact, you can get that cancer. 

Any man can get any kind of the HPV cancers except cervical, of course. 

And any woman can get any of the kinds of cancers. 

And you are right about genital warts and cancer - they are not the same strain. However, if you get genital warts (which is the most common reaction to any of the HPVs), it is a sign that you probably have other HPV strains. 

Also, most people have most of the HPV strains. Not everyone reacts to the strains with cancer. In fact, most people go through their whole lives with HPV, and don't even know it. 

I had rectal cancer, and was treated. But I will always have that HPV strain. And the odds are, I won't have rectal cancer again. Most people who are treated before stage 3 don't have it again, even though they still carry that strain of HPV. "

Contracting HPV in men is significantly harder because the vagina is a much better vector for disease. So is the rectum, which's why HIV is(was) so much more prominent in gay/bisexual men.

I'm sorry you had to pay for it, but based on my above link, I'm inclined to think it's because you're trans, which is another topic entirely. When discussing (hundreds of) millions, we need to cater to the common denominator. I'm unaware if transwomen have a similar chance to contract HPV as normal men or women, and I'm sure that would have an effect on government subsidization of vaccines.

Back to subsidization, sexism is the idea that one gender is better than the other, in some shape or fashion. Acknowledging that one is more subject to certain diseases is not sexism. When tax fund allocation allots only so many *free* vaccines, we need to prioritize at-risk targets, which in this case is young girls and women.

I'm not saying it has to be only one, or both, but it's not like there isn't any wisdom in being a little sexually reserved.

I'm not just talking about medication.  I'm talking about ALL forms of sex education.  Anti-biotics, vaccines, condoms, birth control, regular testing for STIs.  When used in conjunctions it makes it totally possible to engage in a good sex life perfectly safely.  

And people can be sexually reserved if they want.  I'm not going to recommend or push my future children (or anyone) into sex if they don't want to and honestly I'd prefer if they waited until at least 18.  But I recognize that realistically they're going to want to engage in it around the age of 15-17.

Right, but the argument parents (I believe) are largely making is that they want to guide the values and decision making of their own children without interference in that from outside.

Sexual behavior about 'when, with whom, and why' to have sex is clearly drastically different.

Like, all I'm claiming is that the sexual revolution really did change things, and that's because sexual culture is a variable thing, and there are lots of people who don't like the idea of formalized, government policy further taking away their ability to parent and guide the decision making and value structure of their own kids anymore than the broader society has already.

There's biological differences between a womb and a penis. These are *real, quantifiable things*. This is similar to why HIV is more prominent in gay men and, through bisexual men, straight women; the rectum and vagina are designed to absorb, and are better vectors for disease. Contracting HIV or HPV through your penis is much harder.

Comparatively, if a man and a women are given the same task and complete it to the same degree of success, to pay one more than the other is *not* a quantifiable difference. If I gave you two assignments without telling you their creators, you'd have no way to know which was a man's and which was a women's.

Teens who have been properly educated on sexual health won't make the logical leap that since we have a vaccine for HPV then they can have all the sex they want.  We still have HIV, herpes, chlamydia, syphilis, unwanted pregnancies and a bunch more reasons to not have sex OR to stay safe.  It makes no sense.


> Right, but the argument parents (I believe) are largely making is that they want to guide the values and decision making of their own children without interference in that from outside.

Like, all I'm claiming is that the sexual revolution really did change things, and that's because sexual culture is a variable thing, and there are lots of people who don't like the idea of formalized, government policy further taking away their ability to parent and guide the decision making and value structure of their own kids anymore than the broader society has already.

They're perfectly within their rights to do what they feel is best.  But without putting on horse blinders and keeping your children sheltered that's just not realistically possible. Forget government influence. If your teens watch tv, have access to the internet, communicate with a diverse group of peers/friends, or have pretty much any interactions with the outside world they're going to be influenced by things besides their parents.

9774,"Throat and anal cancer is scary shit. I had anal cancer and it's the kind of cancer that once it metastastizes, you're pretty much SOL. 

Most people have the HPV virus for these two cancers, as any sexual contact can spread it. But only a small percentage actually develop cancer. There's no way to know if you're the one who will. 

I did, and it's invasive, life changing, and difficult to spot until it's pretty far along. Thankfully, it's somewhat slow growing, but it's quiet, which means it's often found when it's too late. If you get it after you've started having colonoscopies, you can catch it. I had it way before getting a routine colonoscopy. It's not painful (at least mine wasn't), and the only reason that I knew I had it, was because it was external. 

Everyone should get the HPV shot. It might cause some pain and dizziness, but whatever side effect it causes, is nothing NOTHING compared to having to deal with anal cancer. Nothing. "

9778,"Agreed! Anal cancer is scary because it's symptoms are often vague until metastasis occurs, at which point it's a long road. I had all three shots in the series with minimal side effects and it's WORTH it to prevent cancer. The reason doctors aren't bringing it up is because they are trying to avoid a fight with the parents or because they aren't aware the shot works best before children become sexually active, not because the shot isn't safe and doesn't work."
9779,">Why would the growth rate matter any? 

I already explained in an earlier comment, but let me try again:

Slow-growing prostate cancer is usually **not lethal**. Depending on how old you are when it's diagnosed, you'll probably die of something else before it ever causes any problems at all. Treating this type of cancer will not extend your lifespan, but it probably will leave you impotent and/or incontinent (in addition to all the normal risks and complications that go with cancer surgery and chemo.) It's all risk and no benefit.

This is why some types of cancer screening are controversial. There's no benefit to ""early detection"" if all the cancers you're detecting are these slow-growing types that don't need to be treated, and with prostate cancer in particular that seems to be what's happening."

Ideally it is administered before one becomes sexually active and therefore before they would be exposed to possible HPV infection. It is still okay to get it after that to prevent future infection as long as it hasn't already been contracted (at which point it wouldn't do anything). It looks like it's been shown to be fairly ineffective if administered after age 26, which I think is due to the immune system not functioning as well."

Two of these strains are responsible for genital warts - so there is tangible benefit to men in that regard. Men are also carriers of HPV - though they very seldom develop symptoms, and cancer in men is more unlikely than it is in women. However, as I said, there are obvious benefits to vaccinating men. It has to be done at a young age as well, prior to ANY exposure to HPV. "

9803,You don't need as many males to maintain a viable population?
9804,"True, but HPV associated head and neck or mucosal SCC responds very well to treatment - much more so than smoking associated disease for instance.  We give vaccines to reduce disease burden in a population and the disease burden for males with HPV associated cancer is not as significant as it is for females.

A better argument is to vaccinate boys to stop them acting as a disease reservoir but I don’t know if the epidemiology stays back that argument."
9805,Mouth and throats cancers are increasing in prevalence very rapidly though. Its a fairly significant issue today but likely to be far more of a problem a few years from now.
9806,"For all of those saying that you can't make a difference, these two 13 year olds are about to (hopefully) change a province-wide medical practice that discriminates against boys. Everyone can do something."

* (types of) HPV are the majority cause of cervical cancers. Just look up where the cervix is. How do you thing HPV gets jammed in there? Seriously?

* HPV also causes oropharyngeal cancer. Gets there pretty much the same way. And everybody has a throat.


So yes, treating boys makes medical sense. It even protects future women.

.

Edit: for the 'men get it less, so it's not important' advocates:

[CDC, so US numbers](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm)

**Males account for 40% of HPV-related cancer**.

Considering male cancers are less tudied, and less reported.

(See what I did there? It's the 'most rapes go unreported' trick I learned from feminism).

.

Edit 2: ""yes, but there would be far more female patients if female didn't receive the vaccine"".

Gardasil was FDA-approved in 2006.

HPV doesn't cause insta-cancer. It takes decades, or at least one. The peak age for cervical cancer is over 40. 

The CDC numbers are from the early '10s.

**40% male patients is without any vaccine, neither male nor female**. It will be significantly higher by 2040, when the immunized girls and non-immunized boys have grown up.

.

Edit 3: ""administer to females and male homosexuals"".

HPV vaccines are administered to children before they are sexual. That's sort of the point, really.

Ever wonder why you can catch the common cold all the time and never get immune to it? Or why you're supposed to get an annual flu shot? It's because the disease mutates very fast. All diseases can technically do this, but they need a host to live in so that the bacteria or virus can reproduce, and therefore mutate.

If someone isn't vaccinated against a disease (due to anti-vaxxers or buys not getting the HPV vaccine) and they get infected with it, the disease can mutate while it lives in them, potentially into a form that everyone else isn't vaccinated against. When that happens, the vaccine that everyone already has is now useless, and you've got a new plague on your hands."

Thanks for putting it so plainly. I can sort of get my head round the cost-benefit concept, but given the risk of HPV persisting and spreading over time, I have to query the basis of this ""cost-benefit"" equation. Over what period are the projections based? How many women vs. men are factored into the start conditions, how many at the end... and so on.

That's the thing though. Women more often contract cancer from the virus, but the virus itself infects nearly equal numbers of males and females. Females are more likely to contract the virus, therefore it doesn't make sense to give all of them the vaccine and only some boys the vaccine.

And if there was a study showing that not only could you possibly save 8-28 million dollars, but also the *lives* that go along with those figures by vaccinating boys, then wouldn't it make sense to do so? There aren't any thorough studies that contradict that figure, and other developed countries as well as other provinces of the same country are issuing the vaccine now.

Were that same money toward prostate cancer, on the other hand, I can *guaran-fucking-tee* it would prevent a hell of a lot more than the 1.369 cases of HPV attributable penile cancer which occurs in British Columbia every year, going by the rates provided by the available US statistics. 

There are approximately 3150 instances of prostate cancer every year within British Columbia, just for reference.  

Be sure not to spread that information around though, or else the Men's Rights movement might start prioritizing facts above feels, which could potentially lead to something of significant value actually being done.

10103,"Sorry about that, I'm not downvoting you if that is any consolation.

Also, I chose my words carefully to imply it would help homosexual men as well. [According to](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/) these [CDC statistics](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm), ""about 38,793 HPV-associated cancers occur in the United States each year: about 23,000 among women, and about 15,793 among men."" Excuse the use of U.S. statistics, but I'm sure we can extrapolate that data for use in Canada. If you view the second link, oropharyngeal cancers in men are about as common as cervical cancer in women caused by HPV types 16/18, which are a couple of the types which the vaccine protects against.

So lets use the first link: about 40% of HPV-associated cancers each year occur in men, which is not to be taken lightly. I'd say that 40% alone warrants a free vaccine for men as well, not to mention the effect it would have on the partners of those men.

On the topic of men's rights, I believe this is an issue for men and should be brought to attention for sure. I mean, just because women are slightly more likely to contract HPV related cancers does not warrant the exclusion of free vaccines for men when those vaccines will benefit both genders anyways."

You simply claim over and over again that this is done to save people and that it's the most cost-effective way to save the most people, but you've yet to cite anything related to this, as if vaccinating boys is the worst cost-effective treatment you can possibly do, everywhere.

I'm almost sure that vaccinating thousands of people is more cost effective than covering cancer treatments for just a single person. At least it's the same for other vaccinated illnesses: vaccination is much more cost effective than the treatments, even if you factor in low infection rates.

EDIT:

The user replied to me (and deleted the comment) saying that boys weren't vaccinated since it wasn't cost effective, safe, or effective, and that it makes no sense to doubt those claims (without any source, yet again). Since I had already written my comment, here is my reply:

> cost efficiency

And where is your source on that? 

The article stated that recent studies show exactly the opposite, and how they'd be saving up to $28 million?

> safety

Hard to think of a worse consequence than, you know, death from cancer. There has also never been any death confirmed to have been related to the vaccine. Only people who can't take the vaccine are those with hypersensitivity to its components, or who are severely ill or pregnant, who have it delayed.

> effectiveness

Which is exactly why you give it to as many people as you can. If it has an effectiveness of only 90%, then ensuring as many people as possible take it will lead to herd immunity, where the 90% who got immunized stop it from spreading. I don't know what's its effectiveness, I doubt it's 90%, it's probably upwards of 95%."

Don't get me wrong, nothing is *stopping* us from getting a vaccination if we're really worried about that 0.000049375% chance, but it's not cost effective for the government to fund them for both sexes. And given that female HPV related cancer rates are over twice that of men, they're the obvious choice. "

You understand this is a sexually transmitted disease we're talking about, right? One with an infinitesimal chance of actually *causing* cancer, as demonstrated by the fact that only **1.3** out of over **4,000,000** will end up with penile cancer?

What's more, *because* it's sexually transmitted, immunizing one sex is enough to beyond decimate transmission rates as it is. Bi and Homosexuals simply don't make up enough of the population to sustain the viruses spread on their own.

1) You completely made this up. There are dozens of immunodeficiency disorders. I guess those people aren't entitled to have the best sex ever with someone they trust, who won't know if they have HPV. Down here amongst us savages, doctors don't test for HPV by default. You have to get a specialized lab done and the last time I had one at the state health department it cost me $300 dollars. That's with doctors fees, etc., cut out. There is no way, ever, that every man is going to get that test done every time a condom breaks, which can be often.

2) Men with HPV rarely show any signs.

3) If you actually cared about abolishing this disease, you would vaccinate everyone. I'm sure there's a Bill Nye the Science Guy episode that would help you with that. There's a great Bullshit with Penn and Teller anyhow."

I don't care about abolishing this disease, I care about saving lives. That's why my money goes to more cost effective causes, like prostate cancer.

There are thousands of sites including hospitals, private and public clinics that provide VFC vaccines. See the VFC quick resource for parents for more information.

Each insurance carrier and, indeed, each policy, has it's own rules but I haven't heard of any that exclude males but include females.

If you're eating lots of leafy greens, keeping a healthy weight, getting exercise and plenty of rest, not smoking, limited alcohol, then you're doing almost everything you can.

Next, you might want to try to address your stress/anxiety. For me, Mindfulness is very helpful. I discovered it from a psychological counselor. I don't even think about it anymore, it's just a way of life. Even if it didn't contribute one iota to resolving your infection (I think it would), it will make your life better in general.

10193,"Thanks, I'll mention it to him! "
10194,"I mean when we had sex I didn't have a wart (and had been wart free for quite some time) so I don't really know. 

I will try and improve my diet, I already exercise and don't smoke and drink in moderation. I sincerely hope this helps strengthen my immune system as I've heard vitamins don't work lol.

I appreciate your help but I can't afford a counsellor. I do need to learn to cope with my situation a bit better but every time a wart comes back I'm on square 1 again. "
10195,"Google Mindfulness. The counselor led me to it but you don't need a counselor to learn and use it.

Quite specifically, it retrains your focus. It's often used to treat PTSD (which is how I found it). There is a physiological aspect to your patterns of stress and anxiety - a physical pathway of synapses that trigger over and over again. This is just like going to a gym and working on a particular set of muscles. You've been exercising your responses to certain negative stimuli - perhaps your entire life. This is like skipping leg day.

You can't erase those neural pathways but you can train up new pathways that become suitable alternatives the stronger they get. This is like leg day every day until your calves are at least equivalent to your biceps/pecs. You follow?

Chances are, you're going to dismiss what I say because that is how you've accidentally trained yourself to cope. You will ignore possible solutions and dwell on the problem. That's nature. That's what you have to fight."
10196,"Hmm, I will look into it. I'm not going to dismiss what you're saying yet as I really do want to change the way I see myself and cope with this. 

Thank you for your help!"
10197,"XXOO

Good luck!"
10198,Hey I’m wondering how you contracted warts as a virgin?
10199,"It's different depending which country you're in. In the UK, it's given to girls in school and is not offered to males of any age through the national program. So not many men get vaccinated.

Here in the US, when Gardasil was first approved by the FDA, it was only approved for females since it's target had been cervical cancer. Now that it is proven that HPV causes a fair bit of cancer in men too, we're beginning to catch up. Still, overall coverage in the US is still less than 50%. 

Don't quote me but I think I remember reading something like 30% of males under 26 are getting vaccinated.

**Edit** What did I tell you about trusting me. I was wrong. Here is information from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/infographics/vacc-coverage.html  The US is up to 60% for both sexes (and just adolescents)

This study from 2013 found only >14% of adolescent males were being vaccinated.
http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/136/5/839"
10200,"My doc told me that any man who has had any sexual contact at all with more than 5 people has a 99% chance of having at least one strain of HPV. In most strains, it doesn't produce any symptoms or signs, and there are multiple strains out there that do. As a result, only teens should get it, and most parents are not educated about it."
10201,I feel like most sexually active men get an HPV shot 
10202,I don't know but me and my brother both got it
10203,"That doesn't quite make sense. 

The first part is correct-ish. It's closer to 4 partners believe it or not. Just about everyone who has sex will have at least one HPV infection and most will have more than one.

So, yes, there is definitely a diminishing return the greater the number of partners you've had. But it's not an even curve.

There are 14 types of HPV that are labeled ""oncogenic"" (AKA high risk HPV), and 13 that are in the wart-causing clade, some of which can contribute to oncogenicity but are all considered low or mild risk.

IN MEN, HPV 16 alone is the primary culprit in regard to cancer with HPV 18 a distant second. Just two strains are responsible for 90-95% of all HPV related cancers in men. AND, they are very common. That is probably why your doctor doesn't recommend it for MEN. 

There is a very good chance that you were exposed to HPV 16 if you've had several partners. You see how your diminishing returns practically run dry FOR YOU as soon as you have been exposed to HPV 16.

FOR YOU, you should also think about genital warts. They are in a different clade and are less common types of HPV. Here again, just a couple of types of HPV are responsible for most cases of genital warts; HPV 6 and HPV 11.

The latest Gardasil vaccine is 9 valent meaning that it offers protection from infection of 9 unique types of sexually transmitted HPV.

It covers HPV 6 and HPV 11 (responsible for most warts), and it covers HPV 16 and HPV 18 which offer protection for men from about 95% of all HPV related cancers. Women are more susceptible to cancers caused by high risk HPV types. The other 5 types of HPV covered by the Gardasil 9 vaccine don't have a huge effect on men but bring equivalent coverage from cancer causing varieties to women - in the 95% range.

Your doctor is making a practical recommendation. If you are settling down in life, he's probably right. If you're not, you should still get the vaccine. It can save you from a case of genital warts, maybe cancer, and help prevent spreading high risk HPV to your partners as well.

If you are 26 and under, have insurance and live in the US, the vaccine is free under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). All this could change very quickly so if you're interested, hop to it."
10204,Well now I'm a fully grown male. I'll have to ask my doctor on Thursday and see what he recommends. 
10205,"Thank you for the ELI5. I am 45, and my doc was like, meh probably not going to help you."
10206,"That's what I did. I was asked if I had sexual contact with 5 or more people, and i was told I probably have it already. I think it's really for women and men that are teens."
10207,"Yeah. Unless you decided to start having lots of risky sex or you developed some immune disorder, your doctor is right.

I hope your ELI5 comment was sincere and not an indication that you were offended. Of course, my comment was aimed at anyone who may read yours as well as to you.

I was just reading statistics regarding immunization of males in the US from 2013 and it was much  more grim than I thought. It was 13.9% of adolescent males getting vaccinated in 2013. Shocking!

HPV causes about 40,000 cancers in the US each year and a big chunk of those are men."
10208,I was serious. Thanks for this info
10209,"HPV has been linked to anal, penile and throat cancers so it's good that they are looking at funding the vaccination for boys too. This is on top of warts which clearly is not a female only issue.

Not sure what to say about the chickenpox vaccination, is it not already available for every newborn?"
10210,"Good to see chickenpox will be fully covered for all children - while it's not generally a serious illness in childhood, it's absolutely miserable in adults. HPV for males makes sense as well to reduce throat cancer"
10211,"Guys:  you expose yourself to increased cancer risk if you (have) enjoy(ed) oral sex with your partner(s).

HPV isn't just for girls; the virus doesn't care if the genitalia/oral cavity it hangs out in is male or female (men suffer a self-imposed negative healthcare bias; also, people forget that early mortality isn't the only average lifespan reducer).

Do your kid(s) a solid and get them HPV vaccinated.  It's one of those gifts for which they they'll never know to thank you and you'll never need to ask if they use."
10212,"Good. Can they please get more funding in the next budget, too?"
10213,"Yes! As a nurse vaccinator and mother of a male, I am so glad to hear this. I hate that my child was not being protected against HPV just because he was born with a penis. HPV affects both sexes and how do people think female get HPV in the first place? They get it from males, so lets not over double the cover of the vaccine but pretty much wipe those viruses from existence. Why should I a mother of a male child have to pay $600 in vaccinations so he gets the same cover a female gets for free.

If girls had been excluded from a vaccine like that there would have been all hell to pay. 

Now to just convince them to expand it to the 9 strain gardasil version... 

Interesting they are looking at switching to the 2 dose rotavirus, the two dose version only covers 2 strains of the virus vs the current 3 dose version covering 5 strains. It also has tighter time frames on giving the vaccine, so more children will miss out due to parents delaying vaccination or forgetting to come to appointments. Why are we reducing cover??"
10214,"> is it not already available for every newborn?

No...you have to pay for it."
10215,"Nope - the chickenpox vaccine is currently only funded for immunocompromised patients not for newborns. This would extend it to all children which is a significant boost. Currently the vaccine is recommended for children but not funded.

10216,"The other important side to vaccinating males too is 'herd immunity'. Basically you try to vaccinate a certain percentage of the population (eg. 95% depending on the virulence of he illness) and that causes the rate of the illness to go down over time. Basically by not vaccinating boys, you allow it to spread to girls who are unvaccinated still. Vaccinating the boys means they can't spread it. I thought this through and went to my Dr to get it like a good boy. You need three shots that cost $150 each, so I didn't get it in the end"
10217,"The problem is it can be a serious illness in kids too. And the social/financial costs are huge, too, with the incubation period maximising time off school/work."

[...]

> Researchers have identified over 170 types of HPV, with ~25% being transmitted through sexual contact via the anogenital region

[...]

> 70% of clinical HPV infections in healthy young adults may regress to subclinical in one year and 90% in two years while still being transmissible [...] when the subclinical infection persists—in 5% to 10% of the infected—there is high risk of developing precancerous lesions 

"
10227,"But they havent defunded it at all? In the last 8 years, their budget has increased by $200 million?

One of my other coworkers said ""I mean good on him on doing that, but I'm not going down there"". I hadn't actually thought about how he contracted it until then, so I was both horrified and amused at the same time.

10239,"Pharm econ is my area. A few thoughts based on reading the abstract simce I can't get the full version until I am at work.

1. This is a cost utility study, which is more informative and more difficult to conduct than a cost effectiveness study. Basically, it accounts for morbidity - impact on quality of life not just quantity. 

2. The treatment is actually cost saving, meanimg it improves health while reducing costs/expenditures.  From a policy standpoint, it doesn't get better than ""we can spend less money while makong people healthier."" We are usually willong to spend $100k per quality adjusted life year in the US. Spending -$42 would be a no brainer for Canada.The cost savings would be nearly $8 million while improving quality of life, assuming the study uses good assumptions.  

3. This is based on Canadian values, meaning one may not be able to extrapolate easily to other nations like the US, where healthcare costs are different. 

4. A discounting rate of 5 percent is used. This devalues costs and outcomes that occur in the future. 5 percent is at the top of the acceptible range for discounting.  Most would use a number closer to 3 percent. This may have impacted the results. I would want to see the sensitivity analysis to see more detail before accepting these results.

5. The benefit is surprisingly low. If less than 1 qaly (quality adjusted life year) was realized from vaccinating nearly 200,000 people, I would be surprised.  I would want to check how they arrived at that number. The sensitivity analysis (how we account for uncertainty in theoretical pharmacoecomic studies sinice statistical analysis can't be used) will be incredibly important. It will tell us which assumptions have the strongest impact on the conclusion and (if a Monte Carlo analysis was done) the likelihood that the conclusion of the base case (that we should pay for this instead of choosing to spend that money elsewhere)  is correct. (Yes, I know that is an oversimplification. )"

10242,Stupid question but do males not get the Gardasil vaccine as frequently as females? I thought that by now it was pretty routine for both girls and boys past 12. 
10243,I got the vaccine because I didn't want to transmit a virus like that to somebody I might care about. The protection it gives me is just an added bonus. 
10244,"This is a great innovation, it'll protect men from an easily transferred virus. With it being an important risk factor for many cancers in the neck/head, its better to be safe then sorry!
"
10245,I heard that you can only get it if you are under 21 as a male. Is this true? I'm 28. Can I still get it? Is it effective?
10246,[removed]
10247,"I'm absolutely in favor of vaccinating people in general, and I see the reason and the benefits of vacinnating males, would it be only to preserve herd immunity.

Still, I'm not sure about Gardasil, which gets a very bad press in some countries, especially in Europe. Some people argue that clinical tests were insufficient, and that the vaccine itself is inefficient (and causes, in very rare occasions, huge health issues). I don't think we should adopt it carelessely for the whole population as this article (and the whole reddit thread) suggests."
10248,"My sons doctor offered this to him during his last physical and mom said no. She has the last say in medical decisions so I had no choice but to shrug.

10258,"This is a no-brainer. I'm male and was vaccinated at 18. Now that there's a new 9-valent vaccine out, I'm considering getting revaccinated. All boys and girls ages 9-26 should receive the vaccine.

It's perhaps the simplest and most dramatic intervention to head off cancer we can make right now. Tens of thousands of cases of cervical, penile, rectal, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers (which will be primarily caused by HPV, not tobacco, in the future) would be prevented every year. Perhaps even prostate cancer rates will fall.

Even with the low vaccination rates we have in America, [rates of HPV infections have already declined by at least half.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/health/study-finds-sharp-drop-in-hpv-infections-in-girls.html)"

10261,"Does this vaccine affect older males who might already be infected with HPV?

Also why isnt anyone telling young men this HPV is transmitted by performing oral sex on women? The growing incidence of various sexual practices is likely behind the recent rise in incidence.

Turns out hpv is usually cleared by healthy people without a vaccine.

I too had stage 4.  All that means is that the cancer metastasized from the origination to something else like tongue/tonsils/lymph node, etc.  Which is fairly normal.  Instead there is another naming conventions that more articulates the actual diagnosis better.

With all that being said.  My sisters are planning on getting all their kids, boys and girls, vaccinated, and the wife and I will be doing it with our daughter."

10278,"Men are susceptible to warts, as well as cancers of the penis, anus, rectum, and oropharyngeal cancers, even though most infections with HPV will be asymptomatic and never lead to pathology. (I think warts alone are a pretty compelling argument for vaccinating males!)

HPV has a protein called E6 which is very similar to the normal cellular protein E6-AP which is a protein the cell uses to target proteins for degradation. E6 binds to a cell protein called p53 tumor suppressor protein; by the name you can guess what it does and now why HPV doesn't actually cause the cancer but instead handicaps the cell from stopping it and why these cancers can take decades to form."
10287,Virii reproduce by hijacking our cell's reproduction functions and running them out of control to produce more virii. Cancer is also caused by our cells reproducing out of control. HPV uses one of the same genes to reproduce that causes cancer so with a bunch of HPV floating around our bodies quite often leads to some malfunctioning HPVs to cause cancer.

10292,"TL;DR Not yet. Gardisil was advertised strongly for women in it's genesis and the effects of that advertising still linger. Get the vaccine so your wife doesn't give you HPV. Rambling below.




They were retards when they advertised Gardisil as a female-oriented vaccine in the beginning. Now, a great deal of the male population (including me) believe at first that gardisil is only meant for women because they pushed it as a female vaccine. Of course now, they are saying both genders should take it, but a lot of males aren't going to give taking Gardisil a second thought when they saw the commercials back in the '00's. I'm not among the gen pop, so I'm in the process of taking the shots.

Here's my opinion about people telling me to take this shot.

They need to screw off. I've heard the bulk of arguments for me to take the shots include ""You need to take it so you don't infect your wife"", and to me, that sounds like I need to take the shot because her health is more important than mine is, which is false. Of course I want to protect my wife from getting infected in the future, but I never hear ""You need to protect yourself from HPV so you don't get cancer."" In my opinion, an appeal to keeping YOURSELF healthy is more effective and pays out better in the long run than convincing you to take the shot for someone else's health. 

For example, it's better to convince someone to take a polio vaccine so they don't get polio, rather than get the polio vaccine so that you don't spread it to someone you love. 

An appeal to self is the preferred mode of persuasion since at the core, humans only care for themselves, with few exceptions. Let's advertise to the general population rather than those very few exceptions."
10293,"They don't because GPs have this idea that it's only for girls and that boys just aren't important enough to warrant a reduction in their cancer rates.

The life expectancy of boys being lower than for girls apparently still doesn't raise any outrage."
10294,My sons had it. I think it is a series of three shots so it is important that they follow up. 
10295,I think they will eventually but the health risks are higher for women so they started with them.
10296,"I think 26 is the cut off age. But I know people who have insisted on getting it, you'll just have to pay out of pocket since insurance won't pay for something that's not approved for your age. "
10297,"You should get it regardless of what age you are. 

They only say that you should get it under age 21 because they are assuming you haven't had sex until you were after 21. Based on the research I've done, the shot is beneficial to take, regardless if you've had sex or not. This vaccine covers more than 5 types of known HPV strains that cause cancer or genital warts. The only time it would be pointless to take the shot is if you were the unluckiest person in the world and you are infected by all the strains that cause genital warts and cancer. 

If you already have a strain of HPV, then it won't be protected by the Gardisil shot since the virus got there first, but it will protect against any other possible virus strains. "

CDC recommendation is usually the basis for vaccine reimbursement by insurance companies in the US. So in the US it is both recommended and paid for most boys.

In Canada its recommended by the Public Health Agency, but reimbursement is decided by province.  All provinces provide it for girls and only some provinces provide it for boys.    So yes there may be some sexism in Canada, but hopefully this research will change their minds. It seems to be more likely that it is slow action to new data rather than being intentional sexism.  "

Girls were first given the HPV vaccine because the relation between it and cervical cancer down the road was astonishing, and the use of the vaccine for them was almost a no-brainer. Whereas with using the vaccine for boys, well, not even the authors of this current paper think that should necessarily be implemented yet. One of the authors even states ""I think if we can raise the awareness to start looking at this question in greater depth, we've achieved our goal."" Decisions in medicine with widespread application are only made after VERY careful consideration of pros vs. cons. If in the near future there is in fact further support in favor of covering vaccines for boys for the sake of cancer prevention, we may eventually see a change in policy.

The Gardisil shot, in your case, will protect against HPV strains 11, 16, and 18, but not 6, since you were already infected, and you can't cure yourself of HPV.

Viruses are incredibly small entities. At least 10 times smaller than the average cell, perhaps smaller. And you have trillions upon trillions of cells in your body. If you have just 1 HPV virus, you are at least a carrier and trying to find that one virus is like extreme needle-in-a-haystack.

However, this is based on averages.  So if you have had a low partner count, or slept with partners who were not infected, you would still benefit (assuming you are ever exposed to someone who *is* infected).  

Given the lowered risk of cancer, it's totally worth it.  Insurance won't cover it though because insurance companies are cheap, and averages mean money."
10339,"It's only useless if you have HPV. HPV is super common, which is why the focus is on giving it to kids before they become sexually active. But even if you are sexually active, about half of people have it, so it's possible that you don't, and therefore still worth vaccinating against. "

In other words, if a cell is damaged beyond reasonable repair or things in it are broken or the cell is doing things out shouldn't, like growing out of control, p53 is often activated causing the cell to undergo apoptosis, our controlled cell death. This helps destroy a broken cell with damaged DNA before it becomes cancerous. However, if this gene is not functioning properly, all of a sudden those signals that would go out normally activating it to kill itself don't work and the cell lives on. The HPV strands responsible for cancer play a large part in restricting this process."

I am not an expert in HPV, so I don't feel qualified to answer. One of the major questions that would need to be answered is whether or not there is a non-human vector that carries HPV. I am not aware of one, but I am not an expert in this disease.

>In that if you spend the money to mass-vaccinate your whole population, then you may end up with a HVP-free Canada, and you won't have to vaccinate as many people in future?

By the time that this happened, the vaccine would likely be inexpensive enough that it wouldn't matter. If the treatment is cost-saving (which is the result of the base case analysis), then we are foolish not to spend the money, regardless of the cost. (If each dose were $50,000 but the net cost per person to the healthcare system/Canadian government were -$100, it would still make sense to spend the money up front to save money in the long run.)

> (In other words, could we spend the money and do this once-and-for-all? Or would that simply not work in practice?)

If the infection rate among the population were to drop low enough that the cost-effectiveness were to fall below the willingness to pay threshold, society may decide that it is not necessary.  The political headaches might not be worth the expenditure savings to stop providing coverage, though. 

Polio vaccine is still provided in the US despite there being [very few cases](http://www.post-polio.org/ir-usa.html) recently. There were [385 cases in 2013](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poliomyelitis#Epidemiology) worldwide. The CDC in the US does still recommend the polio vaccine for children because it is inexpensive and the benefits outweigh the risks.

10346,"That is strange. Really terrible actually. Even if that is the logic, wouldn't they want to ensure that boys don't pass HPV to girls? So vaccinating them also should also be top priority even if they are focusing on female cancer rates.

Excerpt:

>""Nevertheless, the rising burden of HPV-positive OPSCCs argues for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccination to prevent oral HPV infections, particularly given the unavailability of screening for OPSCCs. The high efficacy of HPV vaccines in preventing extracervical infections among women (eg, vagina and vulva)30 and penile and anal infections among men31,32 implies that efficacy may be comparable against oral HPV infections. Assuming equivalent efficacy, reevaluation of the cost-effectiveness of male HPV vaccination may also be warranted, given the predominant burden of HPV-positive OPSCCs among men.""

So no, we should not ""wait"" at all. We should look at all of the evidence available and make a well-informed decision. The only sticking point for me, really, was your suggestion that this is ""flat out sexism"". That I don't really agree with."
10394,"We should wait until it's shown to help. As far as I know, this is the first study to show a correlation between the vaccine and a decrease in cancer susceptibility. "
10395,"HPV has over 40 strains that wikipedia knows of.

Currently,

HPV strains 6 and 11 can cause genital warts.

HPV strains 16, 18 are covered by the original Gardisil and are responsible for 70% of cervical cancers.

Gardisil 9, recently approved by the FDA, also contains resistance for strains 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 that cause 20% of cervical cancer cases. Gardisil 9 also contains resistance for 6, 11, 16, and 18. "

There's no cure for the common cold, but more often than not, it usually cures itself given enough days. According to some articles, HPV can do the same thing. 

I usually put viral STDs in the same class of HIV/AIDS because you can't cure AIDS, and it doesn't clear up on it's own either. But seeing that your body does clear out the HPV puts you in a better position.

It is still recommended for both men and women to get the vaccine even after becoming sexually active (and for women, even after an abnormal pap or treatment for cervical cancer).

It's been about 3 months. I'm overdue for the second dose and my mom isn't willing to let me go get the others :P I can't find anything to discreetly contact my doctor either. I'm also 16 so there's that too...

10494,"Planned Parenthood does HPV vaccine, maybe they would help you out?  "
10495,"Yes, I have heard that circumcision could lower the risk of HIV. But that is only one of many STDs. And most of the males I know who have HIV are circumcised. A condom works even better than cutting off foreskin."
10496,Idk. My mom allowed the first... maybe they'll allow the rest? 
10497,"Agreed - I'm not defending that line of thinking, just repeating an argument that was made to me."
10498,"Yes, and I don't mean to sound combative, just explaining that my experience has been different. My first husband was circumcised but still had a tremendous amount of foreskin. But he tried to keep the foreskin over the head of his penis during sex (I know, TMI) because he said that without the foreskin, the head was too sensitive.

Also why aren't they suing? And they're STILL seeing the same doctor afterwards?? WHY?
"
10508,"Hmm, this sort of vaccine wouldn't work on males to begin with as HPV in the male body lives externally to the immune and blood circulation system - that is, it resides on the outside of the penis on the skin (where it can cause related genital warts), and in the tip of the urethra.

That being said, the amount of people that don't understand that vaccines consist of a ratio mix of dead and partially live bacteria and rely on those weakened/dead bacteria to kick in your natural immune response to produce antibodies astounds me."
10509,CDC started recommending it for boys to boost industry profits
10510,"This is what happens when you have mandatory vaccination in place.  Any and all vaccines are thrown into the schedule - this includes the complete failure known as the flu vaccine (and the Gardasil vaccines).

You don't think the government would turn you and your children into revenue streams at the cost of your health/happiness?  The government is literally a bloated bureaucracy to fill the pockets of the donors and lobbyist that rubbed their backs during election time.

"
10511,"So the vaccine protects against several strains of HPV. There are several hundred strains. The majority of them are asymptomatic. However several strains cause warts. A different several strains are directly linked to cervical cancer.

The HPV vaccine provides immunity to the most common strains that are linked to cancer. 

By vaccinating males it prevents a male from becoming a vector to spread cancerous HPV strains. This is a vaccine that has the potential to eliminate a very common form of **cancer**. There is also a growing trend of HPV linked throat cancer in males. This would very likely shield against it. 

This is the only vaccine my entire life I actually want to have. However I was born too late for it. 

I strongly recommend this vaccine for all young males and recommend parents to strongly consider proactively adding to their children's vaccine schedule. "
10512,That's awful 
10513,"Yes at least now his cervix will be protected. In all seriousness the vaccine is completely unproven. It was fast tracked by the FDA. There is simply no long term data to say if it will work or not, or whether the 'protection' will wear off before people become sexually active."
10514,"It's only meant to stop certain types of HPV, but Merck admitted that if you already have HPV when you get the vaccine your risk of Cancer increases.

The body clears itself of HPV naturally, it's no big deal, Cervical Cancer is incredibly rare and nowhere near worth risking a dangerous vaccine for.  The reality of what's going on is that the jab is to decrease fertility rates to bring the population down."
10515,"True now you mention it, another pharma success story"
10516,"Yes the vaccine is causing a lot of harm, with no proof of any good"
10517,"It's worth looking into the [Vaccine Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court) in the US. Essentially, if you are injured as a result of taking a vaccine, you cannot sue the manufacturer in state or federal court, but must go through the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program's Court of Claims, without the option for a jury. Some relevant bits:

>The VICP uses a no-fault system for resolving vaccine injury claims.[1] Compensation covers medical and legal expenses, loss of future earning capacity, and up to $250,000 for pain and suffering; a death benefit of up to $250,000 is available. If certain minimal requirements are met, legal expenses are compensated even for unsuccessful claims.

So there are limits on how much you can receive. Perhaps more troubling is this:

>Since 1988, the program has been funded by an excise tax of 75 cents on every purchased dose of covered vaccine.

So even if you win a case, the manufacturer suffers no liability. The compensation is paid by us, the taxpayer. "
10518,"CDC started recommending the vaccine for boys to boost profits

Pharmaceuticals cannot be sued for their dangerous vaccines, they are indemnified.  Vaccines are so dangerous that the only way pharma agree to make them is if they cannot be sued for the harm vaccines cause.

The guy is clearly in a mess, let's hope he can at least improve a little.

That's an excellent comparison; the Small Pox vaccine was leaving many with autoimmune disease, eventually quarantine had to be used to eradicate the disease.  The Oral Polio Vaccine actually spreads a form of Polio twice as deadly as Wild Polio.  Polio was renamed to make the Polio vaccine appear a success.

The HPV vaccine is the most dangerous vaccine on the market, it's inducing highly profitable autoimmune diseases in 1 in 33 and is sending girls into early menopause.  Even if any benefit was proven, it would be far outweighed by the harm caused by the vaccine.  This jab is bringing down the world population, that's the true purpose of sending it out around all of the high schools."

Stop smoking, get regular Pap smears, stop using the pill, stay healthy and hygienic instead of risking a dangerous and unproven vaccine

"
10545,"I can *almost* see the merit in this. 

If you were in charge of public health, and you had good medical reasons to believe that a vaccine would prevent say, 100,000 people from contracting a disease, 10,000 from suffering permanent injury, and 1,000 from dying; and that this vaccine would adversely affect 1,000 nationwide, permanently injuring 100, and killing 10, then there might be a strong argument to rolling out the vaccine and hiding the problems from the public. In such a case, telling people the real risks of the vaccines would lower their use, and would cause more deaths and injuries than not disclosing the risks. 

Now this whole argument rests on all the science being above board and conducted thoroughly and ethically. Maybe it even was at one point. But then once Pharma manufactures realized this was how the system worked, it's almost inevitable that it would be abused, and I think Gardasil is likely a case of that. 

The inherent problem with such a scheme I outlined is that it is so susceptible to abuse, and given the profit motive in the pharma industry, it's bound to happen. And all this is neglecting the possibility that there is a high-level plan to use vaccines as some sort of depopulation scheme. "
10546,"I'm reading a few people mention that, but I've yet to find a solid source for the claim. If you can find one, let me know. 

What I have found is this [42 USC Chapter 6A Subchapter XIX](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim%40title42/chapter6A/subchapter19&edition=prelim) §300aa–12. Court jurisdiction d) 3):

>(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), information submitted to a special master or the court in a proceeding on a petition may not be disclosed to a person who is not a party to the proceeding without the express written consent of the person who submitted the information.  
(B) A decision of a special master or the court in a proceeding **shall be disclosed, except that if the decision is to include information—  
(i) which is trade secret or commercial or financial information which is privileged and confidential, or**  
(ii) which are medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy, and if the person who submitted such information objects to the inclusion of such information in the decision, the decision shall be disclosed without such information.

This leads me to believe that if the vaccine manufacturer was required to admit some problem or known issue with their drug, it would not be allowed to be disclosed. I need to look into this further, though. "

Somewhere along the line, it was determined that the money that we might spend vaccinating boys against HPV would save more lives if used elsewhere. 

It's that simple guys. There's no conspiracy against men, and the decision was not driven by some radical feminist agenda. If you have some evidence to the contrary then by all means present it, but it's highly probable that someone performed an analysis that demonstrated that funding the vaccine in boys would not be cost-effective, and healthcare funders used that analysis to make a rational decision. The end."

* ""Gardasil® has 3 times the number of adverse reactions reported as all other vaccines combined 4
Since it was introduced, 94 deaths and 21,635 adverse reactions to Gardasil have been
documented. Many have included the events listed above 7""

autoimmune diseases) than the vaccine itself 2. This casts doubt on the validity of the results.

10615,How about convincing the people that produce it to work for free? Because government paid via tax dollars is not free.
10616,what about if you just dont want to get a fucking disease? dont have a cervix but i sure as shit dont want warts on my junk. they should add it into the mix when everybody is getting their hepatitis shots in school
10617,Why does it always have to be about women? The main purpose of including boys is to protect them from throat/oral cancer. We're talking about saving thousands of men's lives.
10618,Nothings free in this world
10619,Free autism? No thanks.
10620,It's not just needing things to survive. A lot of the things that *aren't* covered are cheaper than the eventual healthcare costs. What's cheaper - an HPV vaccine or treating someone who gets cancer because they didn't get the vaccine? Because government covers one of those.
10621,In Manitoba there originally weren't enough for the boys and now its too late for a lot of guys I know. NOW there are enough to go around. 
10622,"I was just going to say this (I'm in Alberta).  My son had a free shot last year in grade nine.  Thankfully he wasn't home schooled, or it may not have been covered."

10629,"Yes, who wouldn't want to be immune to two kinds of genital warts and immune to transmitting a few kinds of cervical cancer causing strains?
"
10630,Or you could just celebrate your wart-free genitals.
10631,"Which is ridiculous, since it affects both and is transmitted by both. Everyone should have it!"
10632,Did they give a reason?
10633,"From the very same article: 

> The government recently announced boys under the age of 26, who are ""vulnerable"" to the virus can receive the HPV vaccine for free. 
The government defines ""vulnerable"" at risk-boys and young men as ""those who have sex with males or who are street-involved."""
10634,"Not according to the news article.  Are you perhaps talking about some other jurisdiction?
"
10635,"This person is providing links to an anti-vaccination site. This site's author is a chiropractor who is an anti-vaccination advocate with the purpose of discouraging people from getting their children vaccinated under the premise that ""they should be better informed before being vaccinated"".

While there's nothing wrong with being informed, the suggestion he makes that all vaccinations are suspect  is a disservice to the public. The website citations are extremely poor in nature and self-serving to the man's business which is to offer chiropractic services: ""my objective as a chiropractor is to help people’s nerve and immune systems function at an optimum level"".

Every piece of information in his material should be treated with the highest degree of suspicion.

Vaccination are a critical importance to public health and public safety and, ultimately to the health of your children.

The person to get information about vaccinations is your family doctor. "
10636,"Yes, and HPV tends to clear itself after a few months. With regular doctor visits, HPV is not something to worry about.

I got this shot when it first came out over 10 years ago. I didn't want it, I didn't understand it, but my mother made me. I had terrible hives at the injection site and fever, and she still made me go back for the next two, even though I cried and protested.

I ended up getting HPV a few years later. I guess not a strain they vaccinate against.

When I speak out against it, people (including my mother) say 'oh should we stop using MMR shots too!?' Totally different. Vaccines are great for dangerous, contagious diseases. Gardasil just seems like a way for pharmaceutical companies to cash in.

They would rather pay their board of directors and ""raise awareness"" instead of contributing to *anything*."
10638,"Why do you put ""research"" in quotes? Do you doubt the value of research? Or you don't think that's what they are spending the money on?"
10639,Obviously. The argument OP is tacitly making is that it's worth the social benefit for taxpayers to pay the cost.
10640,"Word. Not just warts, but rarely anal or penile cancer.

Seems like a no-brainer to me."
10641,The secondary purpose though is also to keep it from spreading between women as well. It is more often dormant in men.
10642,I think that's because it's more commonly known to cause cervical cancer (HPV I mean). For instance I didn't know that HPV causes throat/oral cancer (I'm a man). 
10643,"You should familiarize yourself with the concept of [triage.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triage)

Simply put there is a finite amount of resources allocated to healthcare and those in charge of making decisions have to decide how to best use those limited resources to provide maximum benefit to the population.  

It may just be that they've decided the best use of the resources in this situation is to focus on eliminating the transmission vector of the virus from most individuals (excluding male homosexuals) by eliminating the pool from women.  This will eliminate cervical cancer totally in this female generation (which I believe is a bigger issue than the cancers caused by HPV in men) at the cost of this male generation still experiencing the cancers associated with the HPV viruses.  After this generation the disease will have been eliminated (hopefully) and neither sex will experiences these cancers (except for homosexual men).  This route cuts the costs in half (by only vaccinating females and not males) at a cost of one generation of males being still susceptible to the associated cancers.  

So at the cost of one generation of males still having to suffer from the associated cancers what do we get?  Perhaps more chemotherapy?  MRI procedures for shoulder surgery?  I don't know.  I don't make the decisions.  I just know that someone has to and it isn't easy.

It's not perfect, but nothing ever is."
10644,"The vaccine is expensive. They feel that by targeting one gender, it will work for both. If all females are vaccinated, they cannot pass it along to men and they save the expense of vaccinating everyone. Females under 20 years of age are also more likely to have active infections.

http://www.cancer.ca/en/cancer-information/cancer-101/what-is-a-risk-factor/viruses-bacteria-and-other-infectious-agents/hpv/?region=on

I think exemptions should be made though for gay males who won't benefit; they should receive the vaccine for free.

I am female and was not in the age range to receive it for free, so I paid nearly $400 to protect myself and my husband.

Medical professionals are targeting women because they are far more likely to get a cancer caused by HPV, and more likely to die as a result. 

http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/hpv/statistics/cases.htm

http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/statistics/"
10645,"It's *so* much easier to motivate people by targeting women. In our culture, men don't visit the Dr as often as they should, don't heed their advice as much as they should, whereas women are much more likely to seek help and advice.

We could spend all day talking about *why* that is the case, but that's the basic situation."
10646,Didn't know men could even get vaccinated... I wonder if it's too late for me...
10647,Men are expendable. Same reason why they go to war instead of women.
10648,There's a very clear difference in disposability
10649,"This isn't going to save any lives. The vaccine protects against one virus out more than twenty that may or may not actually be the one that can cause HPV related cancers, all of which are rare, treatable and not very dangerous.

The vaccine is a huge waste of money being sold on the hype of a cancer vaccine.  The company is making money hand over fist for pennys on the dollar.  The money could be spent much more effectively on things that actually save lives like not contracting hospital cleaning to the lowest bidder. "
10650,I hope to Christ you were trying to be funny. 
10651,"The thing is that vaccinations prevent the spread of disease just as much if not moreso than they protect that individual. Vaccinating males also protects women.

All it takes is for a male to contract contract HPV and give it to 20 women. You could have vaccinated 10 of those women for free but had the male had the opportunity as well then those extra 10 people may have been spared. Obviously I'm oversimplifying, it's just that I think the idea of reserving it mostly for women because they benefit more is kind of impractical and illogical."
10652,[deleted]
10653,It actually depends on the province. In Alberta boys can get it for free until they leave high school. I'm not sure of the specifics on girls.
10654,"It wasn't free for me, as a woman. It's free up to a certain point in your age, if you accidentally missed one vaccine when you were younger (I was terribly sick and was not informed it was vaccination day), then the vaccine is completely useless.

Went to get it a few years later, and it cost me $400.00. The receptionist scheduled my appointments wrong, and I still didn't get vaccinated properly. Not going to pay for that garbage a second time."
10655,"Of course there would be uproar. If boys are getting a vaccine that girls aren't but the virus the vaccine prevents against primarily kills girls, that's a big fucking problem. You can't honestly say with a straight face you don't understand that logic."

Sorry that's ridiculous - you'd rather invest in treating cancer than eliminating it (and a particularly nasty and poisonous form of treatment at that).

That's not even what the science says will happen. The public policy and mandate is to just greatly reduce certain strains of HPV which cause cancer so that cancer rates and deaths drop significantly. There most likely will be no eradication.

>If a male is proactive enough to want the vaccination then their act also prevents transmission and has a similar effect of safeguarding women who don't get the vaccination themselves.

Great, then they can do it but must pay. As it stands right now, public health policy, which is backed up by science, says that taxpayer funds need only be directed to targeting the most at-risk gender for the benefit if both."

The problem is, the study quoted above by /u/tiqr says nothing about QUALY gains or costs for men. The study evaluated the cost effictoveness of vaccinating females only vs males & females, but only in terms of the cost per QUALY gained by women. From the study:

>vaccine for 12-year-old girls would reduce cohort cervical cancer cases by 61.8%, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $14,583 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Including male participants in a vaccine rollout would further reduce cervical cancer cases by 2.2% at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $442,039/QALY compared to female-only vaccination.


The cost effectiveness goes to hell bc you're doubling your vaccinated population, but only getting  a 2.2% return on that investment. Though to re-state: that effectiveness value is only for female's quality of life. That was the goal of the study - I  haven't seen any papers re: male QUALY gains/cost effectiveness, though I'd guess it's not great,  considering the rarity of hpv-related cancer in men."
10816,"It's not bullshit.

$14,583 vs. $442,039 are not the raw costs of the vaccine, they are the cost-effectiveness ratios over a lifetime.

For example, say it costs $500 to give the series of HPV vaccines to one individual.  That $500 treatment saves LOTS of money over the average woman's lifetime, because she will not need expensive treatments for cervical cancer later in her life.

Spending that $500 on a boy, however, doesn't save any money, since HPC rarely affects men.  If the girls are already vaccinated it just wastes $500.

That's why the cost-effectiveness to vaccinate men is 30x more.  It's not that the upfront cost is 30x more, it's that the payoff it 30x less (therefore making it a waste of money)."
10817,"Its calculated by looking at the return on investment. Obviously buying and administering 2x the vaccines isn't going to cost 30x. The point is that it's an essentially worthless endeavour because boys are being immunized by proxy. Single gender vaccinations for HPV are really really effective and cost effective. There are mountains of peer reviewed scientific data to support this.

If you want to make a case against it, at least make an educated one: gay boys won't see much benefit. Even if you make it free for them, that puts them in a bind.

But please, enough with the notion that this scheme isn't helping boys even if they aren't getting the vaccination. It does, completely. It's honestly just as bad as listening to anti-vaxxers: vaccines + ignorance = outrage. It's the same formula."
10818,"> How does handing out double the number of vaccines cause your cost to increase by a factor of 30?

To put it bluntly, you get the most bang for your buck by eradicating the virus in the ""most promiscuous young girl"" nodes of the population tree digram, which is where the infection spreads the most.  A lot of STDs are like this.  Outbreaks among teens are common.  From syphilis cases, for example, they can identify the individuals most ""responsible"" for the spread and it ends up being these girls.

EDIT: To make it even cheaper, you could try to predict which girls will be the sluttiest.  Fatherless girls, for example.  This is actually feasible, but since this would cause an outrage, one just immunizes all girls before they become sexually active.

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/georgia/outbreak/details.html

>Based on routine contact interviewing and investigation of infected and uninfected people, and special ethnographic interviews with key participants, a complex picture of sexual interaction, starting at least 1 year before the diagnosis of the first syphilis cases, emerged. **At the center of this outbreak was a group of young white girls** (two thirds of whom were 16 years of age or younger) who, in various combinations, met periodically to use drugs and have a variety of sexual interactions with several groups of slightly older boys. The venue was usually the home of one of the girls whose parents were out for the evening. 
"
10819,"> Any gains by/for men were not analyzed.

That's because there is nothing to analyze.

We already know only 0.0016% of heterosexual men get cancer from HPV.  There is no need to do an analysis to find out that giving all boys an expensive vaccine is not cost effective to stop 0.0016% of men from getting cancer.

It's common sense once you look at the numbers, no analysis is necessary."

10821,99.9% of the time it's harmless for men because currently the data doesn't count throat cancer as a HPV induced disease.

There are faces behind statistics and the male demographic generally gets hit with this cancer when they are in the best, most productive time in their lives. While it's true that immunizing the females will confer a level of herd immunity, let's not just dismiss vaccinating men. Look at the dollar total and compare that to MANY other social services and you'll see it's very small. This is something that should be available to all children as much as polio, MMR is. 

You don't want this happening to anyone, trust me. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. It's a brutal treatment and if you are lucky you get to live a new lifestyle you would never choose yourself."
10833,"But you have to ask the question...why is it that this sort of reasoning is ONLY allowed if it benefits girls? There are obviously going to be boys who get cancer and have their lives ruined that would been saved had they been given the vaccine, yet people seem to accept them as collateral damage to save money...yet if someone suggested vaccinating only boys to get the maximum societal benefit while letting a few girls suffer there would be outrage.

I think the child soldiers analogy is perfect - despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of child soldiers are boys, international organizations spend a large amount of money on reintegration programs specifically for girls to insure that no girl ever falls through the cracks and can't find support. But when it comes to things like HPV or sexual assault, suddenly that extra money isn't justified and it's just okay to let boys suffer?"
10834,"12,000 HPV cancers among men vs. 20,000 for women. How is this 'nothing to analyze'? "
10835,"Do you have a source for that? I couldn't find one, esp. since cancer incidence by sexual orientation isn't really tracked. Based on some other data, and a few assumptions, I get the following:

151.8 million males in the US
LGBTQ self-identification @ 1-7%, from a veriety of sources referenced [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_United_States). I went with 5% for ease of math

So, we then have:
144.21mill heterosexual men
7.59m non-heterosexual men

From the American Cancer Society's 2015 estimates for males:
Oropharyngeal: 32 670
Anal: 2 640
Penile: 1 820

Total: 37 130

If we're generous, and assume that only 25% of oral cancer is caused by HPV, then we get a new total of 12627.5 (32670*.25 = 8167.5). According to [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/18/health/a-mouthwash-rinse-may-predict-throat-cancer-recurrence.html?_r=0) NY times article:

>Papilloma viruses, which are also spread through genital sex, have become the leading cause of oropharyngeal cancer in the United States, as smoking has declined and men have become more willing to perform cunnilingus.

Then, for .0016% of heterosexuals to get HPV related cancers, there must be no more than 2307.36 cases in 2015 (144, 210, 000 * 0.000016). Heterosexual men would then represent 18.27% (230 736/12 627.5) of all male cancers. To put it another way, non-hetero men have 4x the risk of hetero men for this set of cancers. The most recent figures I've seen put that risk @ 1.75-2.25x.

If we use a more realistic estimate of oropharyngeal cancer, 50%, then we get 230736/20795 = ~11%, or a 9x increase in risk for non-hetero men. The assertion just doesn't make sense."
10836,"It's not sarcastic.

You are not at risk, since HPV is not harmful to heterosexual men.

If you have it the worst you can do is pass it along to a woman.  As long as the woman is vaccinated, like she should be, it's not an issue."
10837,"I didn't say it was harmless for men, I said it was harmless for *heterosexual* men.

Those 12600 cancers are mostly in gay/bi men.  Only 1246 are straight men.

While I will admit 1246 isn't technically ""harmless,"" it means you only have a 0.0008% chance of getting HPV related cancer as a heterosexual male.

That is *statistically* harmless."
10838,"Not if free vaccinations are given to all girls, which is what we are talking about in this thread."
10839,Pretty sure we'd have heard about it if there was a demand of demonstration. 
10840,"It is still free for boys in the US and Australia though, why would they provide it for boys there if it isn't needed? "
10841,"Saying what you want isn't enough. We all have cravings. Following a plan is important. Starving the beast might be a good strategy to getting the goverment to play ball with men. A starved health-care might and private health-insurance might be the most cost-efficient solution for men when it comes to healthcare. HPV is just one point in the list that I don't need, and therefore don't want to pay for."
10842,"Giving the HPV vaccine only to women and gay/bi men does benefit everyone equally.

Men and women are biologically different.  Men don't need an HPV vaccine (unless gay/bi), a mammogram or a pap smear.

The absence of those things doesn't mean inequality.

"
10843,"You are so wrong.

Without the public healthcare system you'll be surrounded by people hacking tuberculosis on you all day long.

Good luck not getting it!"
10844,">Men make up for than half of new cancer cases related to HPV.

About 38%, actually, if we're assuming that all the new cases are the result of HPV infection."
10845,"While on the one hand I agree with the general sentiment of male disposability, and we're clearly on the losing end of gender-specific healthcare funding, that isn't really what's going on here. The study linked was conducted in 2004, several years before the HPV = male throat cancer news hit the public, much less the public health research sector. For reference, Michael Douglas (the media poster boy for the entire oropharyngeal cancer from HPV thing) was diagnosed in 2010. At the time of the study, it wouldn't have made sense to look into the effects *on* men, since the researchers were *exclusively* studying cervical cancer data."
10846,"I understand where you coming from, but it doesn't change the fact that we have a finite amount of resources and have to allocate them to the most effective treatments.

The unfortunately fact is that the hundreds of millions of dollars it would cost to vaccinate all boys could save more males lives if spent elsewhere.

Yes, it sucks to be one of the few that get the rare disease, but we just don't have the resources to prevent every person from getting every disease, so we have to do what benefits the most people."
10847,"Unfortunately when it comes to medical prevention treatments cost-effectiveness has to be an issue, because there isn't unlimited money to go around.

It's the same reason we don't give every child in North America the Yellow Fever vaccine.  Spending 100's of millions of dollars to vaccinate against something that kills a couple of people per year isn't a good use of money.

That money can be spent on something that will save more lives.




"
10848,"Will you stop being willfully stupid? 
First of all, if all girls are vaccinated, the chances of a boy contracting HPV will be drastically reduced.
Second, we vaccinate girls rather than boys because cervical cancer is very common whereas oropharyngeal cancer is  rare.  "
10849,"You missed the word ""heterosexual"" when you read my comment.

Gay/bi men are the majority of those male cancers, and they get the vaccine for free, so they don't factor into this discussion."

Treatment for cervical cancer involves cryotherapy which removes a thin layer from the cervix.

Treatment for HPV induced throat cancer involves chemotherapy, radiation and possible surgical removal of the esophagus- a much more devastating outcome."
10856,"But take the child soldier analogy again:

If we spent all the money we spend researching reintegration techniques for girls and spent it helping to save boys instead, we could certainly save many more lives - there are relatively few girl child soldiers, and there definitely isn't unlimited money for rescuing child soldiers. But we still spend the money on girls because it wouldn't be fair to deny them the same protection boys get - even though helping them means that we can help less people overall.

But suddenly, when it becomes boys we're screwing over in the name of ""cost-effectiveness"" and utilitarianism, now it's okay."
10857,"I said ""heterosexual men."" Gay and bi men can get a free HPV vaccination, so we are not talking about them.

Men don't have a vulva or vagina.

Heterosexual men don't put penises in their anus or throat, so that's not an issue.

That leaves only penile cancer, which men get at a rate of 0.8 per 100,000.  That means only 0.0008% of men will get penile cancer from HPV.
"
10858,"Do the math...

0.018 vs 0.0008 means women are 23 times more likely to get cancer from HPV.

That's why they get the vaccine before boys."
10859,"As long as a lot of men plan on having sex with women, keeping everyone healthy is still in everyone's best interest. "
10860,"That's not a valid analogy.

In a society where girls are vaccinated against HPV there is no reason to vaccinate heterosexual boys.  It offers zero benefit.

No one is ""screwing over"" heterosexual boys by not giving them an HPV vaccine.
"

10862,"That analogy falls apart when alpha fucks and beta bucks. Some men just end up as drones while watching their resources being drained away from them without them participating in the sexual marketplace. And, this is not just about incel loosers. It's about the upkeep men keep paying for women that aren't in family and women they don't fuck. There are lots of men working their asses off to pay for the upkeep for women while getting nothing in return."
10863,"Not all girls are vaccinated. Not all boys want to admit or even know at 12 what their sexuality is. All we know is that a nontrivial number of boys will likely get cancer that could have been protected had they been vaccinated, and this is okay with people."
10864,"Men don't have babies, so how is that a reason for heterosexual men to get free HPV vaccines?

Have you read the thread you are replying in?  You seem to be talking about HPV in general, not in the context of this thread."
10865,"I mean if that's your viewpoint why limit it to women? Your taxes help pay for public school (which, even if you don't have kids, you went to or had the option of going to), public transportation (maybe not convenient to you), general healthcare, handicapped ramps...

It's in everyone's interest to protect the health of the general public. 

What's more, you're acting like men are completely footing the bill. Plenty of women pay taxes as well. 

"
10866,"It just comes down to the fact that there's not enough money in the world to protect everybody from everything. This decision was made to protect the most amount of people in the most effective way. 

What's more, vaccinating all (or as close to all as possible) of the girls *does* protect the heterosexual boys a lot, and gay men can get the vaccine free until they're 26, so 12 year old boys are not required to determine their sexuality. "
10867,"> Not all boys want to admit or even know at 12 what their sexuality is

Then they can get the vaccine later in life for free.


>All we know is that a nontrivial number of boys will likely get cancer

1.6 per 100,000 herterosexual men get cancer from HPV.

You seriously think it's a good use of money to give every boy a vaccine for a disease that only 0.0016% of boys will ever get?

That money is better spent on prostate cancer prevention, not HPV.

So, if somebody would not pay for my stuff in a reverse situation I have no problems working against me paying for their stuff. Lucklily there is a wave of right-wing politics spreading these days.

You still seem to be missing the basic point that vaccinating women and gay men largely protects heterosexual men. It protects everyone via herd immunity. 

HPV causes cervical cancer. Vaccine prevents women *and gay men* from getting HPV *and passing it on to men.* I don't know how you think this hasn't saved lives. 

I also don't know if there's significant funding for prostate cancer research. Since it's so prevalent in men AND women, I'm assuming there is some, but if there isn't, then your premise that no one cares about men has fallen through. But I don't know why you'd want to divert funds from prostate cancer to vaccinate men when it's been explained multiple times that it's not necessary. 

Also most of the EU has government funded healthcare, so I don't know what you're talking about there. "

We prevent viral infections successfully all the time. It's how we eradicated Polio. Vaccines this person probably got as a kid include MMR, and children born after 90s definitely get varicella vaccine to prevent chickenpox. We give adults Shingles vaccine to prevent the chickenpox virus reactivation from being sympotmatic.

Prevention is always best. This is why HPV is a big deal. Mostly we're interested in preventing the spread of the cancerous subtypes of HPV like 16 and 18, to name a couple. Males are at risk for cancers but this also helps prevent any males from being reservoirs or sources of infections for women who can get Cervical cancer.

As I said earlier, some viruses can be treated. HPV isn't one of them. Hepatitis C is now curable (cure rate isn't 100% but it's a pretty amazing >90%). But as we know. Many viruses have this far proven incurable  such as HIV, Ebola, Zika, to name a few that are popular in media."

I imagine that the fact that it's only funded for women is based on a cost-analysis where the hope is that the vaccine will reduce rates of cervical cancer and pre-cancers, leading to less investigations like colposcopy, and meaning that we may be able to extend the current screening program to 5-yearly smears rather than 3 yearly.

There is also the difference betweem statistical significance and practical relevance. If HPV statistically raises bowel cancer risk by one percent, there is no practical value in going this route.

The benefit of HPV vaccine should strictly be based on its cost versus the benefit to the society. If HPV vaccination to females gives net benefit but is a net cost to males, it should not be subsidised for the latter. I hear ""one fewer death always makes it worth it"" way too often, but this is just not how public health policies work.

10961,"Haha I actually do, do you? Are you saying that a study showing a 1% increase in the rate of cancer in people who have HPV would be considered statistically significant? P-values aside, 1% would generally be considered such a small amount it would not, by any reasonable scientist, be taken to mean a causative connection between the two. Explain yourself. "
10962,Well it would be considered statistically significant if the p-values were suitable. Following that I'd want to know the adjusted r-squared to know how good of a fit the model was. Everything is relative. In medicine many things may have a low co-efficient e.g. 1% but it's the potential causative effect (that statistical significance would prove) that matters.
10963,Isn't there something about men getting throat/tongue cancer from cunninglus ? In that case it'd make sense giving men the vaccine.
10964,"When my son had it done it was considered preventative and thanks to Obamacare was covered at 100% like all vaccines. So Obamacare > Canada at least in this instance!

However, personally, I don't think it should be given to boys at all. It has not been tested in males for safety or efficacy. Literally all the studies on the vaccine were done for girls.

There's actually a very good reason it hasn't been studied in boys:

http://www.thehpvtest.com/about-hpv/faqs-for-men/?LanguageCheck=1

""There is currently no FDA-approved test to detect HPV in men. That is because an effective, reliable way to collect a sample of male genital skin cells, which would allow detection of HPV, has yet to be developed. In October 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did approve the use of the first HPV vaccine (marketed as Gardasil®) for boys or men age 9 through 26 for the prevention of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11."""
10965,"I commented on the other post, but I'll weigh in here too

The vaccine definitely SHOULD be given to both boys and girls, but I want to highlight here that the reason it was given preferentially to girls at first comes from a public health standpoint, not from any gender discrimination. The vaccine is pretty new, was FDA approved in 2006/7. It only covers a few of the existing strains of HPV, particularly the ones implicated in cancer. Currently the vaccine has only been proven effective as a preventative treatment. It most likely won't help if you're already infected. Many people with the disease are asymptomatic or become asymptomatic within a year or two. This is the reason for the age cutoffs. If a young lady gets the vaccine at age 12, there's a much smaller risk that she's contracted the disease already. Women also have a higher risk than men for developing cancer from the virus. This is why women were preferentially chosen. I personally believe that this kind of leaves out men who engage in sex with men, because I'd imagine they have a similarly increased risk compared to straight men. It's also noteworthy that the vaccine isn't mandatory in most countries yet. I suspect this will change soon. The CDC began recommending that young boys receive the vaccine in 2011. Following that, many countries began to offer it to boys with the same age cutoffs. I'm sure there will be more equality in how the vaccine is used (and paid for) in coming years. Complaining that it's preferentially given to women (for now, during this introductory phase) is like complaining that flu shots would be preferentially saved for pregnant mothers. Sure it's discrimination, but it's based on risk and epidemiology, not sexism"
10966,"Just say he's ""transgender"" for the day, start a shitstorm, and it will be free for both genders by the end of the year.  Unfortunately you need to work within the system these days..."
10967,"I would like to see more longitudinal studies on the long-term effects of Gardasil in boys and men before I would personally be inclined to push quite as hard as that parent, but I can't blame her. It does look pretty sexist, and maybe it kind of is, but it's clear there are a lot of medical differences between men and women as far as this goes..."
10968,I don't really see what the outrage is. Public Health decisions need to balance cost with efficacy. There is little point doubling the cost of the vaccination programme if it will only lead to a small reduction in the number of infections.
10969,It even makes sense in the context that most women were getting exposed to it from sex with men. 
10970,"The fact that there isn't test for it is *more* reason to vaccinate, as there is no way to tell if you are a carrier of the virus or not."
10971,"The test for HPV in men is *too good*. Because you are sampling non-mucosal skin, you have to take an aggressive swab, famously in one case using sandpaper. *Everybody* who is sexually active contracts one or more strains of HPV, but most infections are unnoticeable. Most infections are almost completely suppressed by the immune system too, even the 'cancer causing' strains. What they are looking for in regular smear tests are the small percentage of infections that persist. Those are the problematic ones that greatly increase the chance of cancer.

If you are scraping skin with sandpaper and checking for HPV DNA, you *will* find remnant HPV on almost every patient. There is no easy way to find active infections and trace them over time."
10972,"> That is because an effective, reliable way to collect a sample of male genital skin cells, which would allow detection of HPV, has yet to be developed.

I wonder if that would be easier if they stopped removing the foreskin."
10973,">Literally all the studies on the vaccine were done for girls.

Because they where the ones most affected by it.  They need to find a way to detect it and kill it or least neutralize it in men, as its men who are the carriers of it.  So if they can stop it there or reduce it there then women benefit more so."
10974,"It's not really based on epidemiology though, since vaccinated young buys before the become sexually active would educe the likelihood that they become vectors of the virus later in life. I demanded to be given the vaccine prior to 2011 for this reason, not because I expected any expected benefits of the vaccine for myself, since, as you mentioned, the vaccine protects against strains implicated in cervical cancer. I was already sexually active at the time, so it may have not done one lick of good, but I felt better knowing I at least tried."
10975,[deleted]
10976,"That makes no sense. If there's no test, there's no way to tell if the vaccine would even do anything in boys. Why would you give someone a drug that may have possible side effects that you can't even prove works?"
10977,"All vaccines carry risk, in this case we don't know what the risk is and we can't tell if it worked or not.

Suppose I had a drug that was supposed to do ""X"". I then told you that we don't know if it actually does X or not and there is a possibility it could do anything but X.

Would you still take it?"
10978,"Quite possibly, but in those cases I'd think they could run a study on intact men."
10979,"The epidemiology part there is that they were able to roll the vaccine out in a limited fashion while still doing the largest amount of disease control by targeting the most at risk population. I think they're going particularly slowly with implementing this vaccine because STIs are such a sensitive topic and vaccines have been getting a lot of flack as it is recently (anyone catch the republican debate yesterday? they had some choice words to say about vaccines). I have no doubt that it will become a mandatory vaccine for all children soon. 

I think it's great that this mother wants to push to make it easier for her son and other boys to get vaccinated but.. that was already the goal. Maybe that will spark some conversation that gets the vaccine rolled out faster, but it won't be because there was discrimination"
10980,[Hmm...](http://i.imgur.com/4lz7VJn.png)
10981,"This may be an ignorant question, but why would the vaccine work on girls but not boys?"
10982,"The immune systems of men and women are slightly different, but that that much different that the rigorous testing procedures done one women and girls were enough to satisfy my concerns."
10983,"Yeah, I never thought it was a discriminatory policy, just a misguided one."
10984,You aren't wrong.
10985,Any number of hormone interactions or reasons no one has thought of. That's why clinical trials exist. There are tons of drugs that work well on paper and in rats and even in *some* people that are ineffective or dangerous for other people. Just read about [grapefruit interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grapefruit%E2%80%93drug_interactions)
10986,"There are a number of drugs that have such a severe effect on the opposite gender that they shouldn't even be handled by men or women.

For example: methotrexate.

Should gardasil be treated the same way? Unknown at this time. Hasn't been studied."
10987,"But, it's not a ""drug"" - it's a virus.  A vaccine is simply a dead virus."
10988,Good explanation.  Thank you.
10989,"There is a world of difference between methrotrexate and gardasil though. Gardasil is snippets of the capsule of certain strains of the virus. There is no reaction possible that would be worse than getting the virus itself.

Methotrexate is a folate mimic, nearly identical to folate with the additions of amine groups. It competes, and has a slight preferential binding, with folate with certain enzymes in the body, making it dangerous for women who may become pregnant, and can act as an abortifacient. Women who are not at risk for becoming pregnant can take it for it's intended uses.

Even a cursory knowledge of biochemistry, combined with a little common sense, would suggest that there is little to no risk in men in receiving the vaccine."
10990,"In this case, it's not even a killed virus, as some other vaccines are. It is just the capsid proteins, which when injected into the body can self assemble into what looks exactly like the virus from the outside, but contains no genetic material."
10991,"Vaccines have other things in them besides the virus hollow. Protein coats, stabilizers, preservatives. "
10992,"The way the gardasil vaccine is designed there is virtually no chance of it working in women but not in men. It may not work as effectively in men because women's immune systems work at a naturally higher rate. However, you would expect to see it have some effect. The flip side is the chance of side effects are lower in men for the same reason. Even without testing, one could safely assume that a male receiving the vaccine would be at worst, no worse off than not receiving the vaccine.

People bringing up things like methotrexate and grapefruit interactions are the same type of people who will tell you anything with chemicals is bad."
10993,Deductive reasoning is not strong enough for the field of medicine.  Medicine requires direct empirical confirmation.
10994,"Common knowledge is irrelevant because a) it hasn't been tested and b) because dangerous drugs slide through all the time.

See the other pharmaceutical link on the front page today."
10995,"So, what you're saying is that in this specific case, it should be fine.  There are still differences between men and women where some vaccines/treatments might need to be gender specific though.  Right?"
10996,"I didn't say common knowledge, I said common sense with a basic understanding of biochemistry. I don't hold this against you, since you've demonstrated neither."
10997,"Yes. Most vaccines are going to be the same regardless of gender, because all it is is a controlled infection. So if men and women react the same to an infection (which is pretty much all infections), they will react the same to the vaccine.

Other drugs have different mechanisms of actions, and yes, hormones could effect them but this would be entirely a case by case basis, and usually would be hypothesized before hand because we would understand the mechanism ahead of time, and the enzymes/systems involved."
10998,Check my other links in this thread on pharamceutical safety and get back to me.
10999,"Hmm... Looks like it's not in this thread after all:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10774264

""Conclusions:
Our findings demonstrate higher rates of adverse effects in females following vaccination with MMR vaccine, irrespective of the humoral response. **This study emphasizes the need to consider possible gender differences when evaluating new vaccines.**""

Done with Gardasil? Nope. Doh!

Guess it's not so common sense after all, huh?"
11000,Neat.
11001,"Hmmm, why wasn't it done with Gardasil? Maybe because the testing was completed on females, and that who has higher rates of adverse effects. As I've stated over and over again, a male taking Gardasil, at worst, would be no worse off than if he had not taken it.

edit: BTW, You do realize it actually was done with Gardasil?"
11002,"Really? They tested effectiveness on a vaccine for which there is no reliable way to test effectiveness?

Now you're just being silly.

The study I linked to pointed to a difference in tolerance between males and females for MMR, females got the worst of it.

We don't know if males or females tolerate Gardasil differently because it hasn't been tested in males."
11003,"Females *always* have worse reactions ti vaccines because of their immune systems. This is the same reason they have higher rates of autoimmune disorders. Our immune systems are the same, but females have more active ones.

11008,"Did they do it because they listened to us, or because they fucking ignored us as usual and listened to someone else?"
11009,"This is a testament to the marketing power of the vaccine industry. First the incidence rate of HPV is very low and the progression is very slow. If you are one of the unlucky few to get it the treatments are effective. This alone makes large scale prevention programs questionable. Putting money into making vehicles safer has prevented much more suffering then this vaccine could ever do simply due to the raw number of incidences.

The above is assuming that the vaccine is actually effective and safe. There are numerous reports that the vaccine is not effective and may actually have harmful side effects. This is a victory for the vaccine company, not the general public who has to pay for it. "
11010,This is not a small victory.

11012,"Hard to judge without reading the article but the whole reason there's such a great case for giving the HPV vaccine to men is because of the massive benefits for homosexuals.

The majority of lives saved would be homosexual men, that's despite them being such a tiny percentage of the population. It's quite damming that we don't hear mass outrage from the LGB community about the issue TBH."
11013,"Her arguement makes sense.

If all females are given the vaccine for free then all straight males are automatically protected.

Only gay/bi males would be having sex with unvaccinated people."
11014,"Yes, I should say it is."
11015,"""This is a testament to the marketing power of the vaccine industry.""

No kidding!

And it's also a testament to how little our general population understands what's going on in the health field. I certainly believe that HPV vaccine is terrible for *women*. But, then, to give it to men is to multiply all the bad arguments tenfold.

11019,"“HPV also causes oral and anal cancer in men.”

“But even if it didn't, men don't want to watch their wife or girlfriend die of any of these things.”

11020,No but that's part of the issue. HIV weakens the immune system which lessens resistance to HPV.

Well, that's because you're an idiot. I know at least one man personally who had second-stage cancer from an oral HPV infection. "
11022,"I find that reasoning to be tautological at best.  AIDS lessens resistance to every conceivable disease.    By this logic, homosexuals are the whole reason why there's such a great case to be made for *any* vaccine.  "
11023,Such personal anecdotes mean absolutely nothing. And I reported you to moderator for personal attack.
11024,"Play nice you two. 

We still dont know enough how HPV interacts with males, however studies and commonsense both point to men not just being carriers  of HPV, and are potentially effected by it. "

11027,"I had warts and cervical dysplasia. I got the vaccine after I was diagnosed. I was 31. 

If you are able to comprehend all the available information about HPV without a cognitive bias that's been hammered into your brain for decades in the form of stigma and such, then no, it is not reasonable at all. 

But if not, then get the nanovalent. "
11028,"I'm 35 and married and just got it. Why? I know I'm disease free now and I figure, given all the controversy, I should be willing to submit myself to it before my kids are. I had to do a lot of work to get it though. Get a prescription from your doctor and take it to costco. Ask for gardasil 9. Cost will be $450.

However, some people will have had many sexual partners at 26, and some will have had few or none.  The AMA choosing 26 based on averages is pretty dumb.  They should base it on the number of sexual partners the person has had.  Perhaps your insurance company is aware that the AMA was using retarded logic."
11036,"If they said it's covered, it's covered. Get a copy of your handbook and find it in writing. The ACA changed a lot of rules in terms of coverage for these types of things, and its pretty common for the hpv vaccine to be covered for both men and women of any age. "
11037,AMA had nothing to do with the age range.  The FDA and Merck do.  Gardasil is FDA-approved for individuals ages 9-26.  Giving it to somebody older than 26 would technically be considered off-label use.

EDIT:  OK, I did some researching myself and I'm going to have to disagree with you.  This source (http://www.futurity.org/why-don%E2%80%99t-more-boys-get-the-hpv-vaccine/) says the following:

>The biggest factor affecting male HPV vaccination rates is the lack of a well-established connection linking HPV in men to a life-threatening illness. The correlation between HPV and cervical cancer in women is responsible for popularizing the vaccine among young women.  Unfortunately, a similar connection that would motivate males to get the vaccine has not yet been established. That needs to change, says Newman.

But there are other cancers that boys/men can get from HP, including anal, oropharyngeal, and penile cancers.  Read more about it here:
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6050a3.htm.  A direct quote from this CDC publication states:

>ACIP recommends routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years with HPV4 administered as a 3-dose series (recommendation category: A, evidence type: 2§). The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination with HPV4 is recommended for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. 

So yeah, I'm gonna have to disagree with you fuckpoops.  There doesn't seem to be a legitimate medical reason for offering vaccines only to girls.  "
11064,"Do you understand the concept of herd immunity?  Giving it to girls and not boys when up to 80% of males will have carried some form of HPV at some point in their lives is silly.  Vaccines are not as effective if only given to half the population who can carry the disease.

It's like how some vaccinated children have gotten whooping cough because anti-vax parents did not vaccinate their kids, who then became ill with the disease and spread it to the vaccinated kids."
11065,"Wow. People always demonize American insurance companies, but apparently if I was Canadian my meds would cost hundreds a month. Makes my $5-$10 copays seem rather meager."
11066,"Wait, I am confused. Why is a bunch of americans elders going over the border to get your drugs then. Is is just that drugs in general so much cheaper? Ya they might not cover drugs, but is is it so much cheaper is basically acts like you're on insurance?"
11067,"Canadian healthcare does cover drugs, you're being intentionally misleading. For starters, there are all sorts of tough regulations placed on drug manufacturers and prices are part of that. Canada also manufactures a huge number of inexpensive generic drugs, and every province, while different, heavily subsidizes many if not most prescription medications. Beyond that, nearly all in hospital treatment and drugs, including in hospital dental procedures are completely, 100% free. 

I have no private insurance at the moment and I've never paid more than $40 for medication. Now that's not the case for everyone, but you can't say that provincial and federal regulations and subsidies **aren't** a form of drug coverage, especially when the federal and provincial government also pay for the healthcare system from the same coffers. "
11068,If all women were vaccinated this would not be a problem for boys.
11069,"The benefit to males is miniscule, HPV vaccine has a far greater benefit for women than for men. Throat cancer is not even comparable to cervical cancer in terms of epidemiology and incidence, and has many other more significant risk factors like smoking.

It would be a massive waste of government money to vaccinate all boys against HPV. It would almost exclusively benefit girls, who will likely be vaccinated anyway.

We need to stop mimicing the feminist anti-logic of ""If boys get this, girls should get it too or it's not fair"". Should we be  sending all men over 40 for mammograms like we do women, just because 1% of breast cancers are in men? Doubling the cost of mammogram screening just to create a less than 1% increase in breast cancer detection doesn't seem logical to me. This case is almost exactly the same.

"
11070,I think he means there is an ethical dilemma involved in vaccinating all boys just to benefit the small population of girls who weren't vaccinated.
11071,"The main beneficiaries of the vaccine are females. All vaccines carry a risk and some people have reported illness following vaccination.  The purpose of the vaccine was to protect against cervical cancer.

Not all girls take the vaccine. It is quite low. In order for it to be effective a great many more girls need to take it. If all girls took it it would not be a problem for heterosexual boys!  But they do not.

The benefit of the vaccine for boys is very small indeed.  The benefit for girls from boys taking the vaccine is much much higher.

But should you put another gender at risk, ie taking the HPV vaccine for the benefit of girls.  

Gay man would benefit from taking the vaccine.

Heterosexual boys would not!



"
11072,"Men are also affected* by breast cancer (1% of incidences), should we be sending every man over 40 for a mammogram and double the cost of breast screening programs just to make a less than 1% impact in breast cancer detection?

The answer is no"
11073,"Because it is cost-ineffective for men to get them. These types of decisions are based off scientific and mathematical models to maximize effectiveness. 

For example, you can vaccinate 1 million boys to protect 1 of them from getting HPV-related carcinoma. 2 of them might have a serious side-effect to the vaccine. Meanwhile, that 100 million you spent on a useless vaccination program could have been spent on something that would actually save lives."
11074,"Sure, if you are ok with paying twice as much."
11075,"...your point being? If other countries do it then it must be good?

HPV vaccination should be strictly voluntary, and people who want it should pay for it either from their own pockets or through their health insurances.

Beyond that, there are all sorts of additional subsidies that shave a big hunk off the cost of drugs. Canadians without private insurance do not pay very much for most medications. There are some people who pay a lot for specific medications because they have no additional coverage but these drugs are also regulated and subsidized, they're just not cheap. There are also cases where certain regimens that cost tens of thousands and have poor outcomes are not covered and this has on occasion become a controversy.

2. The vaccine may not be 100% effective (doesn't work on everyone), and some people might not be able to get the vaccine at all (due to allergies, weak immune system etc). So it makes sense to vaccinate as many people as possible to try and create **herd immunity**.

3. Following on from the above, why would you want to give HPV to your partner? No need to spread disease.

4. What about gay men? Women getting vaccinated doesn't affect them.

5. Preventing HPV is one ""justification"" for circumcision. Getting a vaccine is a much better alternative than chopping off perfectly healthy, functional parts of a baby's junk.
"
11094,"Summary:

There are fundamental differences in the level of risk HPV poses to males versus females in the general population. Three out of every four cases of HPV-related cancers occur in females, Kim noted, so females obviously stand to benefit more from getting immunized.

And even among the male population, certain subgroups - most specifically gay and bisexual men - bear the highest risk of rare, HPV-related tumors, such as anal cancer.

""There has been some concern that has been vocalized to the effect of, Should we vaccinate all boys so that we can cover this small subgroup of boys who will turn out to be men who have sex with men?"" Since the shot is best given before sexual debut, it would be nearly impossible to target this highrisk subgroup of males at the optimal age of inoculation.

Another argument for the routine vaccination of boys is **""herd immunity""** - the notion that it will help confer protection on unvaccinated sexual partners, for the most part girls and women. ""I think this is a double pronged argument,"" Kim said. ""On the one hand, it calls for sharing the responsibility between males and females for the burden of HPV and the burden of getting vaccinated, but on the other, it promotes equal access to the benefits of vaccination.""

But statistics can work against even that logic. As it stands now in the United States, the uptake among girls of the HPV vaccine has been disappointingly low – as of 2009, CDC data suggest that only about 27% of girls age 13 to 17 had received all three doses of the vaccine. At that rate, uptake by boys might also help confer protection to girls. But if vaccination rates for girls were to climb, the added benefit of vaccinating boys would begin to diminish.

11095,"Here in Australia, boys can get the vaccine for free.

Besides, haven't you ever heard of herd immunity?"
11096,"Right I understood that. I was curious about how National Health in the UK approached the issue of HPV vaccination in boys, the reasoning behind the policy and how they eventually implemented it, so that I could understand how it differed from what was done in Canada.

I have to admit, when I started this thread, this SEEMED to be a case of discrimination against boys (at least in terms of BC health care policy), and labeled it as such because Reddit demanded I add some kind of 'flair' to the post. After reading furch, fuckpoops and other's responses now I'm not so sure. I now realize I don't know as much about the issue of HPV vaccination as I thought I did. And I can't say conclusively that if a public health authority decides to vaccinate girls only, it's a clear-cut case of discrimination. 

As I said to fuckpoops, I'm interested in how health-care policy decisions affect males and men's health, and the health-care choices available to them, but said decisions aren't always clearly discrimination. MRA discussions shouldn't only be complaints along the lines of ""women have it better!"". "

No. This kind of vaccination should never be voluntary because it's herd vaccination. You vaccinate so you don't transmit to another person, not just for your own protection.

Holy persecution complex.  FWIW, I didn't downvote you even though I believe you are wrong.

It doesn't take an epidemiologist to understand why both genders should be vaccinated.  Just a basic understanding of how this particular disease spreads and a basic understanding of how vaccines and herd immunity work.  A quick Google search reveals that the CDC's official position includes ""HPV vaccination of boys is also likely to benefit girls by reducing the spread of HPV viruses.""

It is also worth noting that men are three to seven times more likely to develop HPV-linked oral cancers.  The number of HPV-linked throat and neck cancers has been on the rise in the past few decades and could have provided some motivation for providing the vaccines to boys.

I personally don't consider this particular instance to be a huge ""Men's Rights"" but rather a symptom of a larger problem.  The lack of public funding as a whole for men's health as opposed to women's health is a much bigger issue, especially considering men already have shorter lifespans.  The US for example has the office of women's health, even though American women already live on average 5 years longer than men.  There is no US department of men's health.  The closest thing I could find was a page for men's health... on womenshealth.gov."

It is free, that is undeniable, and I never claimed it was an alternative to private drug insurance. When have you ever written up a bill in a hospital???

>Also, a Flovent puffer cost me 70$ uninsured. Thankfully I can afford that. But many people can't. Those same people generally don't have insurance. 

I realize that, but often times drugs are only $70 because their prices are regulated and subsidized. I am not suggesting that there is nobody out there who can't afford $70 a month for a puffer however. 

>I've had patients who have pneumonia and can't afford the best antibiotics. They ask the ER docs to prescribe them less effective, cheaper, drugs 

You're talking about out-patient care and your wording seems to be intentionally misleading. 

At no point did I say that Canadian health care is perfect, in fact I believe it's been getting worse for a few decades, some provinces more than other due to increased costs and a whole slew of other factors like the discontinuation of infrastructure funding from the federal government. 

However, what you claimed is that drugs are completely covered by patients, which is an outright lie, unless you consider heavy regulations and subsidies to be immaterial, which I definitely do not. Beyond that, your suggestion that treatment and medication in hospital is not free is just a complete load of shit. I don't care if you work in an ER, you're still lying. All healthcare provided within the confines of a hospital is free. Aside from cable access, gift shops and vending machines, no money changes hands.

I had assumed in-school style vaccination programs were hugely effective, 27% is actually shockingly low and to an extend invalidates my thought that vaccinating 50% of the population would protect far more than that 50%; turns out vaccinating 50% of the population is difficult.

Regardless, as stated, the more girls we can vaccinate, the less boys we will need to vaccinate. Makes sense to focus on vaccinating the main potential beneficiaries of the vaccine."
11117,"Yes I have heard of herd immunity, it explains why vaccinating all females also has a protective effect against males, and why there is a diminishing return of vaccinating males (the less affected population) when females have all been vaccinated.

Admittedly, it is impossible to vaccinate all females, so vaccinating males would have additional protective effect; however, it is far more efficient in terms of disease control to promote vaccination in females than in males."
11118,"Assuming that this graph is from a reputable scientific source, which I doubt, if accurate it demonstrates that by targeting only 50% of the population (women), a proportionally MUCH larger decrease in the totals of all these cancers via HPV prevention occurs (50% vaccination rate causes 17,600/26,900 = 65% decrease, plus the factor of how many less men get the virus due to the protective factor from women being vaccinated anyway).

Wherever these statistics are supposedly from, it was likely concluded by virologists and epidemiologists that by far the most cost-effective program would be to vaccinate all girls, leading to AT LEAST a 65% decrease (based on these stats anyway, realistically it's likely closer to 80%+ with other factors considered) in these cancers. In healthcare, the money defines how much you can do. If you can protect against more than 65% of these cancer incidences by vaccinating only 50% of the population, that's what you do. You don't double the costs for significantly less return just because ""it's not fair to only vaccinte girls"" (even if they are BY FAR the main beneficiaries of vaccinating both men and women)."

You will say that's a conspiracy theory and you might be right - why would a company spend a couple of millions on lobbying to receive billions in profits, that would be just silly.

I don't feel that males are ""oppressed"" if they aren't given exactly the same health care options as females, but I do feel that men have the legitimate right to ask, or to request a reasoned explanation why not. 

A few months ago I had an interesting discussion with a researcher about a study on the incidence of UTIs in a university student population. The researcher restricted her study to females. When I asked why, she explained that a) UTIs are much less frequent among males because semen has bacteriostatic properties, and b) because UTIs are more common among females its much easier to design a research study based on that population group. It was a well-reasoned explanation and I was perfectly happy with her answer.

At the very least, if it's not appropriate to vaccinate the entire male population, then at the very least HPV vaccination should be free for males as it is for females in BC, for those who want it. "

My point was more one of economic efficiency (like you say) and population-wide efficacy than anything else. The breast cancer example was an exaggeration of what I feel the problem at hand here is; that it's not worth vaccinating boys as well when we can protect against perhaps 80%+ of these cancers through only vaccinating 50% of the population.

The point, with this and with the breast cancer example, is that yes, it would be great if we could protect everyone (male and female) from these cancers. However, if the experts are saying it's most cost-effective to directly protect X population and spend the rest of the money elsewhere (let's say the money gets spent on promoting prostate cancer screening for a fitting example) then that's what I'll go with.

Its not just a small exaggeration its a completely false analogy for the reasons I gave.  You said there was minuscule risk, and you qualified that with this 1% breast cancer comparison. Over 50% isnt anywhere the same as 1% and it is dishonest to represent it as such. You used this level of risk as an argument for the economics, but your argument is false since the risk factor is far far greater than you were making out. 

>was primarily making an economic argument with no intent to ""move the goal posts"", but it's all founded in epidemiology.

Of course it was moving the goal posts, it was the definition of moving goal posts. You claimed men arent really affected, that it was a minuscule risk, like 1% male breast cancer compared to women. Men are way more affected with HPV related throat cancer than women. Take away cervical cancer and men are more at risk than women are at getting an HPV related cancer. Men are almost at the same risk of throat cancer as women are of cervical cancer. Men are over half as likely to get a HPV related cancer overall as women are.

If you didnt move goal posts you would have continued to defend the idea that the level of risk is minuscule and your cancer analogy is comparable and justifiable.

"
11145,"An analogy by definition is to simplify something with a clearer example, I did not mean to say the 1% of breast cancer is directly comparable, I meant to use it as an analogy that just because a problem exists doesn't mean it is worth doubling the expenditure over.

No you used it to show the risk factor, because you said in another post that there was only a ""minuscule"" risk compared with women's risk.  Over 50% as likely to get an HPV related cancer, with men almost as likely to develop throat cancer as women are to develop cervical cancer, is not minuscule. It is not comparable with a 1% risk with breast cancer. Your argument was based on this idea that men are extremely unlikely compared to women to develop an HPV related cancer.

>I am happy to retract my statement that the risk is ""minuscule"", I was not aware of how significant it is.

Great, but apparently you arent prepared to take back your breast cancer analogy even though you used this as an example of how little ""affected"" and at risk men were from HPV.

"
11147,"Why would I use it as a statistical risk comparison without any research on the actual risks?

As I have said repeatedly and clearly, I was using it as a comparison for something which affects women more than men, to say ""Should we screen/vaccinate EVERY man and woman out of concerns for equality rather than targeting specific populations where vaccinations/screening programs would be more effective?"" It's pretty clear and simple to understand what I'm saying, even if the differences in effectiveness of HPV vaccine vs mammographic screening are statistically a very large difference.

I used this as an example in multiple comments with different phrasing but the same intent, so you should be able to understand at least one of them (hopefully). If you genuinely think I'm saying ""Like breast cancer, the risk of men getting HPV related cancers is around 1%"" without any kind of evidence or statistics behind it, you are either intentionally refusing to understand what I am saying or you are plain stupid.

You told me men are affected by HPV like men are affected by breast cancer and its absurd to waste money screening men for breast cancer when there's only a 1% chance of getting it compared to women.  **Men are over 50% as likely to develop a HPV related cancer as women are, many more times likelier than women to develop throat cancer, almost the same levels of risk for men developing throat cancer as women developing cervical cancer.**

>If you genuinely think I'm saying ""Like breast cancer, the risk of men getting HPV related cancers is around 1%"" without any kind of evidence or statistics behind it, you are either intentionally refusing to understand what I am saying or you are plain stupid.

You gave that example at the same time you said it was a minuscule risk which you admit was false. Obviously that is the reason why you gave this example and it represented how you say the risk is for men. If I said men should be given breast cancer screening and provide an example of heart disease being a higher risk factor for men than in women, you'd rightly tell me this is a false analogy and deceptive because they are not comparable. Its not comparable anyway even as an economic analogy since you cant contract breast cancer from women but you can with HPV. Bad and dishonest analogy all round. Find another, admit how its wrong.

As for the rest of your post, its just goal post shifting and not taking responsibility for your error. Argue that it makes economic sense all you like not to give the vaccine to men, but dont misrepresent the facts to play down the risk to men to make it seem like your argument is stronger than it is.

Targeting vulnerable populations with screening or vaccination programs doesn't seem like a good idea anyway, and using a much plainer simplified example of where women are targeted with certain medical procedures for good reason would be a stupid thing to do to forward my opinion on this matter."

I am referring to all your posts to various people which said it was minuscule risk and so there was no point.  When I said you ""spouted your mouth off"", I am referring to what clearly seems like a knee jerk reaction you had posting to various people all saying the same thing that looks like you felt really sure of your position. Your opinion of it not making economic sense clearly being based off the idea that it was such an incredibly low risk. 
  
Now you admit you didnt do any research, which means you just assumed it was a minuscule level of risk or you allowed yourself to believe others that may have made the same claim. Telling me you're in a medical science field makes this much worse as you should known better the value of checking your facts.

And btw, [here is what you said](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/2i5962/canada_girlsonly_hpv_vaccinations_unfair_say_new/ckzdf47) about your analogy...

>We need to stop mimicing the feminist anti-logic of ""If boys get this, girls should get it too or it's not fair"". Should we be sending all men over 40 for mammograms like we do women, just because 1% of breast cancers are in men? Doubling the cost of mammogram screening just to create a less than 1% increase in breast cancer detection doesn't seem logical to me. **This case is almost exactly the same.**  

It is not anywhere near ""almost exactly the same"" in any sense,  but that is what you thought it was when you wrote it. I told you you said it was of comparable risk and you denied it by saying you actually gave the example to make some **other** point, but apparently you forgot you wrote this. That ""other point"" would have also made it a bad analogy anyway, since breast cancer is not a communicable disease. Bad analogy.

 
>I also probably wouldn't have accepted that one of my statements as wrong while defending the rest...

I can only assume admitting more than one obvious error is too much of a knock to your ego.

There may well be a valid argument to make about not giving men the HPV vaccine, but people in support of this idea need to stop so significantly playing down the risks to men just to make their argument seem stronger. This is not honest and if men believe it they may well be far more blase about it, which also affects women. Personally  if you vaccinate everyone in the long run it will make economic sense. It really wouldnt cost a lot to vaccinate people compared to all the other vaccines we give, and other expenditures. Women who dont take the vaccine might very well contract it by men who would have had the vaccine if they were able to.

11153,"When my son had it done it was considered preventative and thanks to Obamacare was covered at 100% like all vaccines. So Obamacare > Canada at least in this instance!

However, personally, I don't think it should be given to boys at all. It has not been tested in males for safety or efficacy. Literally all the studies on the vaccine were done for girls.

There's actually a very good reason it hasn't been studied in boys:

http://www.thehpvtest.com/about-hpv/faqs-for-men/?LanguageCheck=1

""There is currently no FDA-approved test to detect HPV in men. That is because an effective, reliable way to collect a sample of male genital skin cells, which would allow detection of HPV, has yet to be developed. In October 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did approve the use of the first HPV vaccine (marketed as Gardasil®) for boys or men age 9 through 26 for the prevention of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11."""
11154,What about adults? I wasn't in school when this came out and they want me to shell $150 each time for the 3 shots needed. even though i'm high risk.

11159,"Mother and nurse of a 9 yr old male in NZ, it would cost me $160 each shot to give it to my son. Yet males carry and spread the HPV (as well as get cancers from it). I think it so unfair. I am just waiting for the 9 strain version to come out and then I will fund it. I would hate for my child to get a cancer that was preventable or to have a partner who got cancer that he gave her (or him) because he was a carrier of the HPV from not being vaccinated. "
11160,I think it is more the case of the legislation catching up with the science.  Still 50% of the population being vaccines will greatly reduce its spread.

The more people you sleep with, the more you put your wife at risk, you should be more worried about that than your infidelity being discovered. Sleeping with sex workers every 2 weeks, that's a lot of potential exposure and risk. 

To answer your questions, HPV stays dormant in the body, it never fully goes away though any visible warts may clear up. So you don't really reinfect a partner, once you've given her the virus she will always have it. It can come back if her immune system is compromised or her body doesn't fully clear the infection. There are many different strains of be virus, there is a risk you will expose her to other strains you come in contact with. As you have discovered, condoms will not always protect against HPV. "
11178,"While, you are correct, there is no male test for HPV, and the other commentators are correct, you are definitely running into the red zone with your behavior, there is a vaccine for HPV.

The reason is actually because HPV primary effects women while men are the carriers.

Its not, just more frustrating in more there's not something more for men here.

No it won't be as it will still exist in men and you even said yourself gay men will be infected by it which means it would NOT be killed off.

11207,"We have a single payor system in Canada administered privately with provincial funds. So the provinces have decided that there is a need to immunize girls and they have created programs to do this. They have covered the cost of this for women and girls in the target age group. They haven't done the same for boys so it's basically viewed as an elective immunization just like say a rabies vaccine would be. 

In fairness the medical community has argued that boys should also be vaccinated, but unfortunately their approach has been that it should be done to further reduce the rates of infection amongst women and girls. In reality there are strong links between a variety of diseases and HPV in men and boys, including greatly increased rates of throat cancer. 

The best arguments I've seen here in Canada have been from mothers of boys who are concerned about their children's health and well-being and don't like the idea of a penis tax on the vaccination. If I had to guess I would say coverage for boys will come in the near future, but in the meantime it still costs hundreds of dollars to have them vaccinated. "

Actually, it does. Its been known to reduce cancer risk by between 4-5 percent. Removing any portion of an object makes it less likely to be prone to specific events. (Sorry for terrible phrasing, as that's the best way I could describe this without coffee at 5 am.)"
11257,So you're anti-HPV vaccination? Why?
11258,"*Hold on there, kids! Have a Lucky Strike, instead!*"
11259,"uhm no? the risk of any cancer on the clitoris is like 2-4% of all vulvar cancer and those are only 0.5% of all cancers, so basically really cutting it off reduces the risk by less than 0.15%. I don't know about you but reducing HPV infection by 5-50% is more relevant than 0.15%

I know that cutting stuff off reduces the risk of cancer on that part but we shouldn't compare excess skin to a sexual important part of the female body. and don't get me started on those stupid studies that show how many nerve endings are in the foreskin, studies show that there is no difference in having it or not (done on adult males that have had sex before and after) If you really need the source I'll try to dig it up."
11260,"I never said that. However, vaccination is itself risky.

What I am saying is that the *true* cause of the rising cancer rates is not smoking *or* HPV - its the one thing we refuse to do anything about - air pollution.

Latest figures estimate that 29,000 people a year die from air pollution in the UK, and they arrive at this figure only after excluding all the other causes, like smoking.

If you smoke, your cancer is blamed on smoking, even if you have HPV and suck diesel fumes all day. If you don't smoke, then the HPV did it... if you don't smoke and don't have HPV... then well... err... we can't blame *you* for it.... and we don't want to blame the diesel fumes and other air pollutants... so let's just pretend it never happens....

Every single one of us is constantly exposed to cancer causing agents. We just pick and choose which agents to place the blame on based on which ones cost corporations the least (or can make them the most money). Banning smoking is an easy fix. Banning diesel vehicles is not. Pushing HPV vaccine is making billions. Using less fossil fuels isn't.

When no one smokes any more, and everyone has been vaccinated for HPV, what will they blame the throat cancers on? Time is coming when we'll find out.

But I'm sure the corporations and their political puppets will try to convince us it is our fault, no matter what. As long as they do not have to pay the cost, they will blame it on anything *but* their own profit making ventures."
11261,">uhm no? the risk of any cancer on the clitoris is like 2-4% of all vulvar cancer and those are only 0.5% of all cancers, so basically really cutting it off reduces the risk by less than 0.0015%. I don't know about you but reducing HPV infection by 5-50% is more relevant than 0.0015%

>I know that cutting stuff off reduces the risk of cancer on that part but we shouldn't compare excess skin to a sexual important part of the female body. 

Firstly, its not *Excess Skin*. The foreskin contains the vast majority of nerve endings that cause Stimulation. The only thing that a clitoris provides is Stimulation to help reach orgasm. This is blatantly the greatest Double Standard I've seen in the years I've been on reddit.

> and don't get me started on those stupid studies that show how many nerve endings are in the foreskin, studies show that there is no difference in having it or not (done on adult males that have had sex before and after) If you really need the source I'll try to dig it up.

Again, what ever your referencing is most likely outdated since last year the CDC and WHO backtracked on saying that Circumcisions were necessary. 

Look, I understand getting them if there is a serious medical issue. What I take face with is that I wasn't given the choice on whether to keep mine or not, simply because *It was the thing to do at the time*. I'll never have a proper genital region because of it. Do you, in any sense or state of mind think that that's fair? If you had a daughter, and your doctor removed her clitoris, would you go apeshit crazy? What if it was a boy? Would you just not care? "
11262,"Except we have proof that 70% of oropharyngeal cancers are caused by HPV. 

Which means 30% aren't. Once everyone is vaccinated for it, 100% of oropharyngeal cancers will be caused by something else, and 0% will be caused by HPV - because everyone will have the vaccine.

That's how percentages work when you're eliminating things. Your argument is like saying ""Well, most people are killed by cars on roads today. We used to think it was horse carriages that ran people over, but in the year 2015, this has completely changed. Obviously, science is dumb""."
11263,"> Adult male circumcision was not associated with sexual dysfunction. Circumcised men reported increased penile sensitivity and enhanced ease of reaching orgasm. These data indicate that integration of male circumcision into programs to reduce HIV risk is unlikely to adversely effect male sexual function.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3042320/

or https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3881635/

> n summary, male circumcision does not appear to adversely affect penile sexual function or sensitivity when compared with uncircumcised men. Although the literature contains a wide range of evidence for and against circumcision, the better quality studies affirm the recommendations of reputable experts who have evaluated the benefits and risks of circumcision as a desirable intervention early in life.

I'm not saying everyone should or we should do it to our children, but once you are an adult and you might want to reduce the risk of HPV in your sexual partners and you, then you can go ahead.

"
11264,"I would let the law decide about what's discrimination but that isn't the only conclusion to jump to other than ""acceptable"". Sometimes the policy just lags behind the science.

If you are a young man though check if your insurance covers this, it may. You may even want to pay for it. Men obtaining the HPV vaccine protects them from HPV related cancers, protects men and women they encounter, and contributes to herd immunity

>What is Genital Human Papillomavirus (HPV)?

>Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common virus. Most sexually active people in the United States (U.S.) will have HPV at some time in their lives. There are more than 40 types of HPV that are passed on through sexual contact. These types can infect the genital areas of men, including the skin on and around the penis or anus. They can also infect the mouth and throat.
How do Men get HPV?

>HPV is passed on through genital contact—most often during vaginal and anal sex. HPV may also be passed on during oral sex. Since HPV usually causes no symptoms, most men and women can get HPV—and pass it on—without realizing it. People can have HPV even if years have passed since they had sex. Even men with only one lifetime sex partner can get HPV.

>What are the health problems caused by HPV in men?
Most men who get HPV (of any type) never develop any symptoms or health problems. But some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause **cancers of the penis, anus, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)** The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types that can cause cancer.

>Are there ways to lower my chances of getting HPV?

>**A safe and effective HPV vaccine (Gardasil) can protect boys and men against the HPV types that cause most  genital warts and anal cancers.** It is given in three shots over six months. [See vaccine recommendations below.]"

This vaccine is and always has been about reducing cancer among middle to old age adults, not about less std's for teenagers "
11326,[deleted]
11327,"Mandatory?  I don't think that many vaccines are truly mandatory.  Pretty much every state has exceptions for parents who do not want vaccines.   

Your concerns seem to mirror those of conservatives.  The special focus on this vaccine is due to the fact that it is related to sexual activity.  ""Why should my child have this vaccine?  She is a good kid who is not having sex.""  I never hear anyone say that their child does not need a pertussis vaccine because they practice good hygiene at their house.  

But the fact is most people do have sex.  Most people who take virginity oaths have sex before they are married.  And even if your daughter is a virgin when she gets married, are you sure her husband will be?  Are you sure that she will never get raped?

We are removing responsibility from the hands of the individual and allowing the government to make those choices for you. That is bad form.

You also mention pre-sexual activity as being a reasonable strategy. I agree. What I do not agree with is the assertion that this is a requirement. Honestly, no vaccinations should be a requirement. If you are dumb enough to allow your child to be exposed to deadly diseases and I am smart enough to inoculate mine against the same, I guess my genes will carry on and yours will not. Is it harsh? Absolutely. Sometimes freedom is not pretty, but it is still the best looking girl at the prom."

11368,"myself, i would ban tobacco. Nothing good comes of it. I would not ban alcohol and sugar, as most people can handle them just fine. 

The difference lies in what your choice has on the broader population. if vaccination were up to the individual to choose, not everyone would get it. these people are putting every one at risk.

Alcohol, sugar, tobbaco, all only effect the individual. if you consume tobbaco you only risk giving yourself cancer. if you carry HPV, Polio, Measles, etc you can effect heaps of people. 

There is also no reasonable reason to object to vaccination. There is no downside. No getting vaccinations puts everyone at risk. the fact that this one is spread by sexual contact should not come into the discussion at all. and this is why the in this case the state must make the decision, and not the individual. That what the state is there for, to make decisions, enact policy's, when idividual choice isnt going to cut it.

11381,"Not being vaccinated only effects those who are also unvaccinated. If I am properly vaccinated, I need not fear your vaccinated state. Thus, it still only effects the individual.

In 2009, 3900 US women died from cervical cancer.

Alcohol, on the other hand, was responsible for 10,000 drunk driving deaths in 2010. Overall it was the primary cause of death for 75,000 Americans in 2005.

Tobacco was the primary cause of death for 443,000 Americans in 2012, 49,000 of whom died due to exposure from second hand smoke.

Sugar was the cause of 25,000 US deaths in 2010.

To give a quick check of the numbers, that is over 600,000 for banning alcohol, tobacco and sugar vs 3900 for cervical cancer.

The reason we do not ban the above? Big money, HUGE. The reason we have a mandated cervical cancer vaccine? Because it was a poor seller and the manufacturer of the vaccine lobbied to have it mandated.

I am not going to turn this into a big business type of thing.

I do want to comment on your ideas of the role of the ""state"" in governance of our lives. 

Privacy is a big deal in the US. The right to be free from interference from the government is a basic tenet of the constitution, a repeating theme if you will.  Our constitution was authored and, by extension, our government was formed with the specific purpose of decreeing that we have inalienable rights as free persons. The role of the government in this country was designed as a way to ensure these freedoms are granted. I do not need a crooked bureaucracy to legislate my life according to their highest campaign donor. I am sure that in Australia, you do not agree with some politicians a majority of the time.  Now imagine them deciding that one day, you can no longer have sugar crusted fruity o's anymore. Nor can you drink soda, smoke a cigarette or have a beer. It is the same argument as mandating a vaccine. Sometimes the state must make a decision for the individuals own good, correct? What happens when politicians change and gay marriage is decreed a non-starter again? The new guys think it corrupts families. 

Whether you live in  America, Australia, or North Korea, there is a universal truth at play here. If you give them an inch, they will take you for a mile and charge you for 10 miles. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.

I take the freedoms bestowed upon me at birth and protected by the blood of men and women before me seriously. I reject the notion that someone else knows what is better for my person. If I want to kill myself with cookies, nicotine and Tooheys then I guess that is my problem. If I wish to test the HPV riddled world sans vaccine, also my choice. I note that my it is equally my sexual partners choice to vaccinate themselves against the very disease which I may carry.

11386,"When helping patients in the clinic, it would be completely unethical to deny that vaccines have adverse effects when they in fact do.  Any medical intervention can have an adverse reaction.  However, I find that patients generally refuse a vaccine not because they are afraid of real complications (like [erythema multiforme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema_multiforme) or [vaccinatum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eczema_vaccinatum)) but rather because of false (and often cultural) beliefs, such as [vaccination causes autism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMR_vaccine_controversy), or my favourite: ""the [flu shot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_vaccine) gives you the flu""


The worst part for me is when parents deny their children beneficial things because of false beliefs.  I read a report that due to these misconceptions, mother's of autistic children often [withdraw them from vaccination scheduling](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22716265) putting them at risk for suffering from a severe infection.  Also related to misconceptions, so many new mother's would not breast feed their children because they believe [colostrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colostrum) to be ""dirty"", when in fact it is the most nutritious, antibody-rich thing you can give a baby.


The list goes on and on, but in the end we respect the patients wishes and let them make all the decisions."
11387,"Ah yes, well that is an entirely different problem.
I remember living in Canada in my undergraduate years and being offered the HPV vaccine for a small CAD$200+tax, and turning them down.  I care about my health, but I am also a student with limited income.  It definitely was not the right strategy."

I didn't mean to say condoms are completely ineffective for all the things, just that they're only slightly effective for most and most effective for HIV.  

Female to male transmission of gonhorrea, syphillys, chlamydia, HPV, and herpes using condoms is easier than male to female. Male to female transmission with a condom is only prevented if the infection site is located on the upper part of the penis. "
11490,That is a good point. The wart causing strain isn't a cancer strain which the vaccine may help prevent. Either way if you're older than 26 they won't give you the vaccine because you've probably been exposed already

11501,"I may have put syph in the wrong category, but the others are preventable by condom use.

> There are two primary ways that STDs are transmitted. Some diseases, such as HIV infection, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis, are transmitted when infected urethral or vaginal secretions contact **mucosal surfaces** (such as the male urethra, the vagina, or cervix). In contrast, genital ulcer diseases (such as genital herpes, syphilis, and chancroid) and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are primarily transmitted through contact with infected skin or mucosal surfaces.

Emphasis mine. Source: [The CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/condomeffectiveness/latex.htm)

Also, bacterial STDs are still something to worry about. Antibiotic-resistant gonnorhea has actually emerged in the US and the same could conceivably happen for other bacterial STDs.

11505,"From your first link, basically everything I've said:

>Epidemiologic studies provide useful information regarding the magnitude of STD risk reduction associated with condom use. Extensive literature review confirms that the best epidemiologic studies of condom effectiveness address HIV infection. Numerous studies of discordant couples (where only one partner is infected) have shown consistent use of latex condoms to be highly effective for preventing sexually acquired HIV infection. Similarly, studies have shown that condom use reduces the risk of other STDs. However, the overall strength of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of condoms in reducing the risk of other STDs is not at the level of that for HIV, primarily because fewer methodologically sound and well-designed studies have been completed that address other STDs. 

>Overall, the preponderance of available epidemiologic studies have found that when used consistently and correctly, condoms are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV infection and reduce the risk of other STDs.

Moral of the story: Don't be surprised when you get burned even though you were wearing a condom. "
11506,Shrug.
11507,Well you definitely need to take a writing class then because that was heavily implied.
11508,"That doesn't negate anything I said. It says they've done a lot more studies on HIV, but that condoms are shown to reduce the risk of other STDs.

Any time you have sex of course there's some risk. Complete abstinence is the only way to 100% avoid getting STDs assuming you weren't born with one, but what fun is that?"

In other news, mental health funding is terrible in Ontario and the wait times are outrageous and then when you finally do get a psychiatrist visit, they will only spend 15 mins with you and push some drugs on you. 

That's the real travesty for the lgbt community right now who are more at risk for a number of mental health problems. "
11513,"It's not discrimination against gay men. It's a health care funding decision. The full Gardasil series costs $500. The cost of vaccinating all the girls is 35 million dollars annually, but since there is such a substantial morbidity and mortality of HPV disease in women, this is worth it. It will also likely result in women needing less frequent pap tests which will also recover a good amount of the money. To vaccinate all the boys would be another 35 million - for very little benefit since overall among men the morbidity and mortality of HPV disease is minimal (even in the subset of men who are gay).

So for such an expensive intervention, giving it to those most likely to benefit is appropriate. This is because ultimately health care is a zero sum game. If you vaccinate all the boys, that is 35 million that will have to come from somewhere else."

Even with what the fight cost me I think the idea of surgically altering people to prevent 'possible' disease down the road is at best a slippery slope and at worst comparable to some of the worst we have done in the name of society. Please vaccinate with Gardisil but don't ever consider surgical means. That's just barbaric. "

If God Himself mandates that guys get their dicks cut, why do women(and apparently some small-minded males) think its so atrocious to even CONSIDER doing the same to women.

When done in proper, sanitary conditions, [male circumcision has exceptionally low complication rates.](http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/prevention_research_malecircumcision.pdf). (TL;DR: ~ 0.2%) If the female clitoral hood is analogous to the male foreskin, I think it would be safe to assume that the rate of complications in female circumcision would be similar, if not exactly the same as the rate of complication in male circumcision. 

If society deems the pain experienced by the male receiving circumcision to be an acceptable cost to receive the benefits of increasing the sexual safety for all of society, why is a woman's pain not an acceptable cost? After all don't feminists say that men and women are equal in every way? Therefore a woman's pain should have the exact same intrinsic value as a man's.

The fact that there cannot even be a purely academic conversation about this topic so eloquently shows the inherent hypocrisy of feminism. The true feminist mantra is: ""We're equal to men in every way. But we're also all special little snowflakes. So treat us the same as men, but better.""

No, we're talking about meta-studies on medical circumcision here, as conducted mostly in the United States and other developed countries. In undeveloped countries with poor practises the rate is massively higher and the complications more severe, hence why dozens of South African teenage boys die every year or are severely crippled during their initiation ceremonies. 

The safety of medical circumcision, at this point is not well established. Even the AAP, which is an American pro-circumcision organisation says as much and European authorities place it at 5%. 

>I'm saying, if socially its an acceptable option for men, why is it not an acceptable option for women? 

It's not acceptable for either but if it were for one it does not automatically follow that it'd be for the other, as different conditions manifest differently on males and females, they physiological differences are too great and so are the vectors of disease transmission. 

>So you're telling me that you can taxonomically identify every single strain of HPV and empirically prove that other than the 4 Guardasil protects against, they do not cause cancer?

We have a passably good idea of which strains cause what. For example, vaginal, cervical and vular cancers are caused primarily by type 16 and 18, while genital warts are caused, overwhelmingly, by type 6 and 11. These are, coincidentally, the four types that Gardasil innoculates against. "

Even that site says Guardasil isn't a 100% sure-fire HPV/cancer prevention: "" no vaccine is 100% effective and Gardasil won't provide protection against the HPV types not in the vaccine, or against existing HPV infections""

"
11542,">Just like you busted my chops for cherry picking low stats regarding circumcision complications, I can guarantee you that 70% figure was the highest positive result from the course of clinical trials.

Because there's no consensus on that matter of circumcision, for various reasons and the numbers offered by present studies are all over the place. This is not remotely the same. 

As I already quoted, it prevents up to 70% of *cervical* cancers, not because it fails 30% of the time, but because the other 30% are not caused by HPV or are caused by different strains of HPV—only 20% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV strains which this vaccine does not necessarily protect against. (There's some evidence Gardasil might be partially effective against other strains) 

In reality however, it can actually prevent up to 97% of HPV attributed cancers in men and 83% in women. 

The vaccine itself is 99% effective in preventing the four strains that it inoculates against, which means it is 99% effective in preventing HPV attributed cancers caused by those strains. 

---

While we do need effective treatments for other cancer-causing strains, this vaccine alone has done most of the work. It's not a ""first step"" as you claim; it's actually put us a lot more than halfway to eradication of HPV-induced cancers. 
"
11543,">Isn't this an apples to oranges comparison?

Some tools are safer than others and the procedures themselves differ but those differences themselves and many others, when averaged out against each other, are exactly what give us a representative view of the damage caused by circumcision. 

There's no apple to oranges here because this number is exactly what we want in the first place. If you want to diminish harm it would be worthwhile to compare different methods against each other to determine which is the safest but that's something completely different. What we want to do is compare the rate of complications of circumcision as a whole against a control, in this case someone with whole genitals. 

>Many people in U.S. society consider it perfectly acceptable to circumcise males.
 
Many people in the US also consider it acceptable for men to have no reproductive rights, be fucked over by the criminal justice system, have to sign up for elective service etc. The whole purpose of this subreddit is to fight against legal and social discrimination so I find it ironic that you would mention that. 

Almost any fucked up practise or belief you can think of, chances are someone thinks it is acceptable. Circumcision is a gross human rights violation and our movement's position is that it should be banned except in cases of medical need or personal choice. 

>Even with the Gardasil vaccine, there is still a substantial margin for error and subsequent infection.

Not from type 6, 10, 16, or 18. Like all vaccines, it is 99%+ effective against those strains otherwise it wouldn't be deemed an effective vaccine. Stop repeating the same crap. "

Now there's a naive, pie-in-the-sky, statement if I've ever heard one.

The ability to reduce HPV-induced cancers by 90% is massive. It basically neuters HPV as a threat for people that get vaccinated. 

Since I'm getting tired of this shit: the fact remains is that Gardasil is really fucking effective, particularly for men. If you get vaccinated against it as a boy, you basically have no reason to every worry about HPV-attributed cancers. "

>Try not to get exposed to the 11 other known strains or an unknown mystery strain! ;D

Look at that number above **97% of cancers caused by HPV in men are caused by strains that Gardasil innoculates you against with an efficacy that is so close to absolute that the difference is negligible.**

That means that only 3% of HPV-induced cancers are caused by all the other strains combined. Is this really that hard to understand? For fuck's sake.

>The ability to reduce HPV-induced cancers by 90% is massive. It basically neuters HPV as a threat for people that get vaccinated.

How can you 'neuter' something that has no genitals and doesn't procreate? Technically, viruses aren't even alive at all since they perform no metabolic function on their own. Since viruses mutate so quickly, this vaccine will not remain effective for long. Ref: polio virus above. ;P

>Since viruses mutate so quickly, this vaccine will not remain effective for long. Ref: polio virus above. ;P

THAT's NOT HOW IT WORKS. Are you seriously trolling me right now? Gardasil works by self-assembling into particles that the body mistakes for real HPV, inducing an antibody response. It's not a fucking anti-biotic.

Other intelligent animals include whales, dolphins, octopi,  etc.  I read somewhere that India recognizes dolphins as people, I believe.  This is due to their intelligence and therefore they won't hold them in zoos/aquariums.

11602,"I know about vasalgel.   I donate to the Parsemus Foundation.

I don't understand the connection between the cervical cancer vaccine and the prostate cancer vaccine.   Prostate cancer isn't caused by a pathogen, so it can't really be compared to the HPV vaccine. "
11603,"The HPV vaccine is still of benefit to the male community as has a number of preventitive benefits against various strains of genial warts and similar. 

You could technically say there is already a Prostate Vaccine however this is treatment not preventitive, research is showing that HPV and EBV could be big players in causing/aiding prostate as well as many other cancers in the body https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120731151739.htm

Point being is to further reseach these finding and to adapt the immunisation tailored to males specific, even the immunisation will not make the chance of getting cervical cancer 0% theres still a risk just severely reduced, the point is to adapt to get this for guys.

Men will still get benefit from the HPV (or cervical cancer) immunisation but science hasn't give up on getting you something even better, the HPV immunisation is that stepping stone"
11604,"Most people that I know that have an adolescent girl in the US are getting the vaccine. The boys are starting to get it as well. The problem is much less an anti-vaccine attitude as it is a lack of awareness and the fact that it's a relatively new recommendation. We could all benefit from campaigns that spread awareness of HPV. However, I take exception to the wording of the title calling Americans ""fucking ignorant"" because the only thing that attitude benefits is to stroke your own ego.

* I have not gotten HPV or cervical cancer, and I may have been exposed to HPV - an ex of mine might have been a carrier since his ex-girlfriend had it.  He never showed any symptoms of HPV and did not disclose his ex's status to me until after we'd been dating for several months.

* The shots felt like being punched in the arm!  They also came with some side effects.  I would recommend NOT planning on doing anything else on the day you get a shot.  I had fevers with all 3 shots and was so delirious from the 2nd one that I hallucinated slightly.  I was fine the next day.

* No changes in mood or sex drive afterwards (obviously).

* And of course I did not catch autism from the vaccine.

11619,"You are not correct.  My sons' pediatrician happily administered the vaccines to them when we asked for it. The 15 year old has gotten all three, and the 12 year old has two to go. "
11620,"It is only offered to women upto 27 because after that age they are not very susceptible to HPV related issues.  From what I understand (correct me if I am wrong) women are most susceptible to contracting HPV during early 20's when there is lots of turn over in cervical cells.  After that not so much.  So I think its not that it doesn't offer protection, but if they don't already have it by then they are unlikely to contract it.

Not sure how this will work now with the risk of oral cancers though….

11621,I thought this as well but it can be offered to boys up to 27. 
11622,"When it first came out, I worked in a clinic and did a vast majority of the immunizations. I was very upset that 27 was the cut off. I was 27. They would have given it to me *IF* I wouldn't have turned 28 before the third immunization.

11633,"My sons got the vaccines when we asked, and our insurance covered it. "
11634,"My boyfriend just went to his doctor the other day, he he said males up to 25 should get it."
11635,"And what is frightening is that he lied about it too, it turned out to be cancer in the tongue."
11636,That's what I meant.
11637,"I'm aware but you may not realize that their literal argument is that out of millions a tiny tiny sum of people may get autism, not that everyone that gets vaccines will. So even by going with their claims, it makes no fucking sense at all.

It's like never visiting a hospital even if you're gravely ill because there's a slim chance of medical malpractice."
11638,"Funding is another story. If you're too old, they (US insurance and whatever gov't assist programs exist) won't pay for your vaccine. It's out of pocket, and *not cheap*.

11639,"> There is still no *approved* test for males though.

FTFY.

There *is* a test, but you don't want it!"
11640,Do you know what the benefits are for a male? Obviously there's the benefit if not becoming a carrier and spreading it to sexual partners (which is reason enough to get it) but Im curious about any other benefits as a male who's considering it.
11641,no point in screening as prevalence is too low
11642,"That will change. They're still in the early stages of the vaccine drive, and they want to hit the most at-risk groups first. As the effects of HPV are worse for women, they started there, and are now giving it to men. Young people are the most sexually active and least likely to already have the virus, so they're starting there. The same is done with the flu vaccine each year - it goes first to healthcare workers and old people. "
11643,How much?
11644,"Why does it piss you off? It's efficacy is not even properly researched in men and older women, do you really expect insurance companies to pay that much money on something that might not even be usefull?

In time, when there is done more research, they should change their stance *if* it turns out it is something that those groups could benefit from."
11645,Care to elaborate?
11646,"The male will not be a carrier infecting more females.  Plus,  there is a minute risk of penile, anal, and oral cancer in males from HPV. The thumbnail in the OP was of Michael Douglas, who attributes his mouth cancer to HPV from oral sex. "
11647,"More and more cancers are being linked to HPV. It is infamously linked to cervical cancer but we now know it is responsible for much more than that. Also, genital warts are not uncommon. "
11648,"Uhh, no. There are probably a similar number of males and females with HPV."
11649,$120/dose x 3 doses
11650,"The issue is with the way the data and experimental design were handled. Age is an easy cutoff, I get that. But why does the cost benefit change so much in the 27+ crowd? Marriage. Once you get married, your statistically likely number of annual sexual partners drops to slightly more than 1. Of course, increasing age does mean increasing chance of previous exposure, but I am not convinced that this is why the demographic limits were chosen. 

I'm not saying there's bulletproof data supporting the over 27 crowd. I'm just pissed because the potential benefits in sexual health awareness are cut short by stopping young men and women wanting to be proactive about protecting themselves and other from doing so, just because the data needed that manipulation to get by the FDA. "
11651,As I was told by one doctor it involves a cotton swab on a long wire shoved deep up your urethra to collect a culture. It's the male equivalent of a pap smear.
11652,but the rates of male genital cancer related to herpesvirus infection is comparatively very low. We don't screen for brain cancer with CT scans of the brain-very low rates of this rare cancer make screening cost ineffective
11653,"One can be infected with HPV without having cancer, and can then spread the virus to others, such as a female partner, who will go on to develop cancer. Furthermore, more and more cancers are being linked to HPV in both males and females.  "
11654,That is a faulty  anologyd
11655,"Currently screening is recommended for colon, breast and cervical cancer. Prostate cancer is controversial. Screening for anal or male genital cancer is not recommended. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_screening"
11656,"Yes.  I got the vaccine at 40 as I had one sex partner for 20 years, made sense for me and no reason it wouldn't make sense for you "
11657,[deleted]
11658,"Thanks, it will be easier to ask now I know other people have done it."
11659,"Yeah, the assumption is that people over 26 have already been exposed to HPV.  This would probably not hold for some virgins (kissless ones particularly).

The problem is that the off label use would mean that it may not be covered by insurance in the US.  If you can find someone who will administer it."
11660,"Thanks for the info, I will ask the GP about it."
11661,Te first few places I contacted wouldn't give it to me. Ended up getting it done at a gay and lesbian center (I am not gay or a lesbian). 
11662,This is very accurate. When that vaccine came out I tried to get it (as a guy) and was declined coverage. They have since changed their position. I was 21 at the time
11663,I will ask about it and then go from there. 
11664,"Update. My doctor didn't ask much, had I ever been sexually active and do I have a partner. I have the first needle on Thursday. "
11665,"I'm not 100% sure, but I would try calling your local Planned Parenthood and asking to speak to a nurse. They'll let you know if you're a recommended candidate for it and if they have it available for you. 

"
11666,"My understanding was that the hpv vaccine didn't work for older people because we had essentially all already had, and cleared, some of the hpv viruses covered by the vaccine.  If you only ever had sex (defined broadly to include oral and fingering) with one person, who only had sex with you, then you likely never encountered a sexually transmitted hpv and would benefit from the vaccine."
11667,"The HPV vaccines have not been proven to work on people 27 and older, which means that they don't know if would even work for you. The immune system changes a lot as you age. A vaccine that works for a 23 year old might have no effect on a 43 year old - so even if you could find a doctor to break the rules and give it to you, you'd have no guarantee at all that it would work. 

Sorry - stay as safe as you can otherwise. "
11668,"I think that while posters are right about age/immune system, if it makes you feel better and you're ok with paying cost out of pocket, you should do it.  I got mine at 30, and my doc recommends it to people who want it regardless if they are 26 or younger, as it has not been clinically tested in older populations but that doesn't mean it won't be effective.  not to say it WILL be effective, but there is a chance.

even with insurance, if you find a doctor to give you the shot, you will have to pay out of pocket.  think it was $600 for the series of 3 shots for me."
11669,You certainly could if you wanted to. As others have stated it is not proven to work for individuals in your age group but that is solely due marketing. Most people in their 40s either already have HPV or are in a stable situation that does not put them at risk. Speak to your medical provider and view the CDC webpage for information about the gardisil vaccine. 
11670,"I'm 22, and my fiancee is 21.  My fiancee had one sexual partner before me, and it turns out that he happened to have HPV.  The strain she got leads to cancer.  There are no warts, and no signs other than abnormal cell structure that shows up on a pap smear.  Luckily, we caught it in time to get her the laser surgery that removes the cells.  So we'll see if they come back and she has to get a hysterectomy.

Knowing what effect HPV has had on her, and knowing that I certainly carry this virus now, I can't have sex with any other woman ever again.  I obviously don't plan to, but this still makes the whole marriage thing much more final.  Also...  I have no way of knowing if the strain she had leads to penile cancer in men.  There's no test to detect it unless it manifests in warts.  I don't have warts.  I have no way of knowing if one day, when I go in to the doctor, I'm going to get told that my dick is going to have to come off.

So all you anti-vaccine shitheads can go ahead and not get Gardisil for men when it's available.  Go for it.  But when you make that decision, I hope you remember my situation.  You're not just protecting yourself: you're also protecting every woman you'll ever sleep with."

This is a warning to all women: There is a 44.6% increase in cervical cancer after taking the live cancer HPV vaccine. The drug companies will use the increased cancer rates CAUSED by the hpv vaccine to fear monger and sell even more cancer to unwitting victims. The HPV vaccine is experimental and was attempted to be made mandatory - dont take any forced shots or drugs from the state.

Listen to this great interview from 1/2/08 on the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams of NewsTarget.com as they cover the spectrum of the new world orders pharmaceutical industrial complex. Issues covered includes underhanded drug marketing, fluoride, prozac and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, diabetes *actually caused* by those drugs, the liver damage you will then get after taking the diabetes drugs, the detrimental effects of the HPV human papilloma virus vaccine, and more. Alex Jones and Mike Adams also cover common sense solutions to cancers and common ailments. This must be heard and is the reason im uploading this.

Keep this quote in mind from the infamous globalist Bertrand Russell if you doubt any of this information:

11677,"If it makes you feel any better, a lot of sexually active people carry HPV 16 or 18 (the ones that potentially lead to cancer). Hardly any of them develop cancer. I think if you've had something like more than 4 partners you're virtually guaranteed to have HPV so relax. If you ever have sex with another woman she likely will already have it, or have been vaccinated. Also, your fiancee won't need a hysterectomy unless she develops the cancer and penile cancer is virtually nonexistent in circumcised men. Sounds like your doctor did a great job of scaring the shit out of you.

But yeah, I agree with you. Everyone should be vaccinated."
11678,"I think this, from Wikipedia with citation, kills the two major arguments used against vaccines in general.

""HPV vaccine is made up of proteins from the outer coat of the virus (HPV). There is no infectious material in this vaccine. There is also no thimerosal, a mercury based preservative, in the HPV vaccine. [43]""

Though there is apparently still vocal opposition to HPV vaccines.

I'll gladly get vaccinated."
11679,glad im single lol
11680,"If taking advantage of their selfish motivation is what it takes to get that vaccine on the market for males, who the fuck cares?! Let them make their money! They deserve it! "
11681,"First I'm throwing it out there I completely oppose mandatory vaccination.  Now... about that 44.6% Statistic.

The 44.6% increase in cancer is not to the general population of girls given the vaccine.  That increase was in the test group where someone was given the vaccine that was *already* infected with one of the strains in the vaccine.  Gardasil did prove effective in those vaccinated that were not already infected.

It's still a scary statistic though, not just because of how high that number is, but also that often an HPV test will show up negative even when a person has it.  

Also NY might have [mandatory vaccinations](http://www.assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?bn=A10942).  Gardasil will be one of them, to middle school girls.  

Another aspect of mandatory vaccination I think is often overlooked too, is that it sends our tax money to the drug companies.  If it passes... Gardasil will have a guaranteed market of every middleschool aged girl from here on out.  Government contracts are great."
11682,">That increase was in the test group where someone was given the vaccine that was already infected with one of the strains in the vaccine

Yeah. This is exactly why people need to be given the vaccine before they're sexually active. The uninformed anti-vaccine fear-mongering is going to kill a lot of people."
11683,"My reason: ""it will never happen to me"".

I didn't get cervical cancer, but my doctor saw abnormalities and decided it was best to remove them. The procedure itself wasn't that bad. What was bad was the subsequent month of leaking massive amounts of clear nasty smelling fluid. 

If I didn't have a desk job with unlimited bathroom breaks, I probably would have had to take the month off. 

After all that was over I got the vaccine just in case. I can't wait until men are vaccinated as a matter of course. "
11684,"Male, age 23 here. I just finished the last shot of the series a couple weeks ago.

I got vaccinated because I know that men commonly don't show symptoms of HPV or have issues, but can pass it on to ladies who CAN have issues. Almost all of my female friends have gotten HPV, some having to go through invasive procedures (LEEP, other scary things) because of cancer concerns. Cancer is no fucking joke.

The vaccine was so easy to get, just had to ask my doctor once. There was some initial reaction because of my age, but I explained that I, well, hadn't really been sexually active since I was 17. I was getting it ""just in case"" I suppose. Insurance covered the entire cost.

I asked him if a lot of men come in and ask for the vaccine, he said almost none do. I don't understand why this isn't pushed equally for both genders. Herd immunity is a thing, and it would come around a lot easier if the whole population were in on it.

I've tried to tell all of my male friends about it, and they're clueless or just think it's ""not their problem"". I'm kind of disappointed at such a response.

It's also nice knowing it will be extremely hard for me to contract genital warts."
11685,"This thread so far has a *loooot* of misinformation.

The HPV vaccine only uses four strains because these strains cause the vast majority of cervial and anal cancers and genital warts.  There are many HPV strains that are essentially inert--they don't give you cancer or warts, so there isn't much incentive to vaccinate against them.  In addition, adding these other strains to the vaccine would likely reduce the immunity to the most harmful strains.

As I mentioned elsewhere, I have a background in Medical Microbiology and Immunology/infectious disease epidemiology, so I'd love to discuss this further with people if anyone has any questions."
11686,"reason why I got vaccinated: I hadn't had sex yet and it seemed like a good idea. 

it's a fucking vaccine. you just knuckle down and take one for the herd. same reason I am vaccinated against everything else. I think needles are icky but I donate blood and I'm listed as an organ donor even though I don't expect to die anytime soon. these are just things you do because my mild inconvenience is worth the common good.

what I should have got in the round of vaccines I took before heading off to college was a whooping cough booster, there was a whooping cough epidemic in my state a couple of winters ago because of these anti-vaccine pinheads and I had whooping cough. 

FYI: whooping cough sucks balls. I think I cracked a rib from coughing, and I had to avoid my grandparents during that christmas because I was worried about killing them."
11687,"I missed the boat by a year when I finally asked for it at age 27. I think it had been offered to me *once* when I was 17 or 18, and I wish I had gone for it. However, at the time I wasn't sexually active and I was involved in a promising relationship with a low/no risk partner. Now circumstances have changed and I really wish I had that extra layer of protection.

Anyway, I highly recommend getting it if you qualify, even if you think you won't need it. Life doesn't always go the way you think it will!"
11688,Needle phobia for me. I'm working on getting rid of it but it's taking a while and the vaccine isn't as effective now as it would have been had I had it when I was younger.

11692,"My husband and I are still on the fence regarding this for our daughters. When it first came out, we were strictly on the ""Not going to happen, nope, never"" side of the fence. We heard so many horror stories about how it ruined these promising young women with it's side effects. I started getting a little more interested and doing my research again when the idea of young men being vaccinated with it as well. 

However, I think we are leading towards getting this vaccination. Well, for our oldest. The last time our youngest got vaccinated, she broke out in hives. 
When it first came out, there was a bunch of fuss and muss over it, going both ways. Now, a lot of that has died down, and it is easier for me to think about it. 
I'm not pro vaccine, nor anti vaccine, really. We opted to delay immunizations for our kids, but they did get them all eventually. "
11693,"At the time it was offered to me at least, the chances of a fatal side effect of the vaccine was higher than the chances of getting cervical cancer from HPV. (source: my mother, a pharmacist) it was also a very, very new drug and not all the side effects were well known. I may still get it next time I go in (I'm getting close to being too old), but I'd need to have my mom look up what they've found out new about the drug since I was in high school. "

11699,"Hopefully it works better in males than females, at the moment the HPV vaccine is a disaster in women, a recent study http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0002-9378/PIIS0002937811009409.main-abr.pdf showed that the jab only reduced HPV-16 infections by 0.6% in vaccinated women vs. unvaccinated women, most disturbing are the data that showed other high-risk HPV infections were diagnosed in vaccinated women 2.6% to 6.2% more frequently than unvaccinated women. In fact, the study reported that the increased rate of infections by carcinogenic HPV types in vaccinated women (other than those targeted by Gardasil) is four to ten times higher than the reduction in HPV 16/18 infections.

This vaccine is going to increase Cervical Cancer rates and the Pharmaceuticals will rather conveniently be making big money from their 'mistake'.  (Cancer treatments bring in over $1500 per month per patient)

 "
11700,tell them they can still get cancer from HPV. 
11701,">Herd immunity is a thing, and it would come around a lot easier if the whole population were in on it.

Actually, we can't *really* push the herd immunity angle with HPV because true herd immunity requires random mixing of a population.  And with a sexually transmitted infection, you're not getting ""random mixing"" because people select their sexual partners.

That said, reducing transmission *is* still a thing and very important."
11702,"Good comment! 

FYI, Merck is developing an improved multivalent HPV vaccine (currently called V503) that covers 9 strains (31, 33, 45, 52 and 58) that also cause cervical cancer. 

This should offer better protection, particularly in poorer parts of the world where screening doesn't happen.

It should be on the market within a few years.

Source: I work in both public health and vaccine development, but here's the [clinical trail info](http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01651949)"
11703,"OT, but MMI represent! Working on my PhD here and I have SUCH a hard time not leaping into battle every time someone spreads misinformation about infectious disease!"
11704,"At what age do you suggest young girls get the vaccine? My daughter is 12, and I do want her to get the vaccine. My sister has HPV, and I'd like to at least help prevent it with my daughter should she become sexually active in the future. "
11705,"I'm used to listen to TWiV religiously. I really liked the few episodes in which they covered HPV.

Here's one in which it's the feature:

11706,"I've already gotten my vaccine, but a lot of my friends say, ""No way, it's too new!""

As a professional in this field (it would seem) what is your opinion on this reasoning?"
11707,This is the most intelligent comment in this thread.
11708,"You should still be able to get it, though it wouldn't be covered by insurance. The limit to under 26 was because statistically most women will have had a few partners by that point. At least, that's how my gyno explained it to me."
11709,"The vaccine wouldn't necessarily be less effective.  There are some concerns about the vaccine's interaction with people who already have strains of HPV, which is why it's recommended for young girls, but we don't know if those concerns are at all valid.  It's also only licensed for women under 26 at this point, but that's not necessarily a sign that it'd be ineffective for women over 26, just that studies haven't been done on that population.

I also don't know about your sexual history, but if it's very limited then the vaccine is still a good idea.  I'd talk to your doctor.  :)"
11710,"I have needle phobia, too, but my mom convinced me to get the Gardasil vaccine anyway. My mother is a doctor herself, so she was aware of the vaccine right when it was first approved, so I got it quite a few years ago (based on the release date, I must have been 17 when I got it).

Okay, this is a bit OT, but since you're working on getting over your phobia, too, I thought I would share my methods. Basically the way I deal with vaccines is this: first I find out if there is a nasal option, and if there is, I get that. I've been getting flu shots as nasal sprays for the four years, and it's fantastic. I don't think Gardasil is available as a nasal spray, but you can at least do that for other vaccines. 

The second is to warn the nurse that I have a phobia, and that I will probably have high blood pressure and will be prone to nausea and getting lightheaded. Most nurses are very understanding if you warn them, but if you don't say anything they can't help you.

Third, I find something interesting to tell the nurse and just talk through it. For Gardasil, I actually can distinctly remember conjugating Japanese verbs for the nurse! It's a very odd memory, but that's definitely what I did, and it worked pretty well. Other things I've used are recapping a documentary or movie I saw recently, explaining a lecture (if you're still in school), or talking about a recent vacation.

I used to use loud music and tell my mom to ""sneak up on me"" because if I didn't know, I didn't have time to freak out, but that really only works when you're getting your flu shot at home. I personally find that talking works better at the doctor's office.

Sorry it's so long, I just wanted to share, and maybe it will help you get Gardasil, too!

TL;DR: I hate needles, too."
11711,"I agree with you but I did decide to get it when the health clinic near my house was offering it for free for young adults under 26.  My body reacted fine thank goodness.

My twin sister got it as well and has had terrible problems with her health since receiving the series of shots. She was a perfectly healthy 20 some year old before them. 

Everybody wants to say oh it couldn't have been the shots.  People also don't want to believe that their are other girls who have had negative side effects since receiving the shots either.  I find it way too much of a coincidence and we really don't know much about the long term side effects. 

People are constantly saying there must be something else going on when she says she believes it was the shots that triggered something. 

My twin sister regrets getting the HPV vaccine and my mom feels bad for encouraging it after all the tests and doctors she's been too. But she thought she was making a good decision telling her she should protect herself and it was currently free. 

I wouldn't recommend the vaccine right now to anyone until they know more information. "
11712,"try your local public heath department and your Planned Parenthood, they'll have cheaper options."
11713,"But are you aromantic?  If not, you could end up in a relationship, which may include sex.  Asexual people *can* have sex, they just don't get much out of the experience and don't initate."

11715,"Most of those horror stories are fake or seriously sensationalized by religious-minded nuts. EVERY vaccination will have a bad effect in a certain percentage of the population, it's not like the HPV vaccine is out of the ordinary or has a higher rate. They purposely editorialized the incidents giving the false message that it was killing a large amount of girls, when in reality it was entirely average.

The deal with them is they think it will make girls have a false sense of protection and become ""promiscuous"" under their strict terms. Studies have shown this is not the case.

I'm not saying you're wrong in your decision to be cautious, but just don't fall for the mass hysteria of things. I realize it's probably different when it's your own child, and I can't claim I know how that feels.

I'm a man who got vaccinated. It just makes sense."
11716,"Japan have suspended their HPV vaccination program, they're currently investigating if more harm than good is coming from the scheme.

Keep a watch on Japan, as they are right up there with the best when it comes to vaccine safety.  See what they do, I'd recommend taking their advice."
11717,"Your mother was wrong.  And, to be fair, vaccines are different than ""new drugs"" because we by and large understand their mechanisms.  I'd look into getting it."
11718,"Wise words, Japan has just pulled their vaccine program due to the adverse effects, your Mother was right!"
11719,"You're mistaken.  Those four strains of HPV are responsible for the vast majority of cancer and warts caused by HPV.  

As they said: 

>Gardasil protects against HPV-6 and HPV-11, which cause 90 percent of genital warts, and HPV-16 and HPV-18, which cause 70 percent of cervical cancers and 90 percent of anal cancers.

You are statistically highly unlikely to get cancer *or* warts from any of the other strains, which is why those four were chosen.  Adding more strains into the vaccine would've decreased the immune response to all of the strains.

Directly from the CDC: 

>[Almost all cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV)](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/cervical/basic_info/risk_factors.htm)

I'd love to discuss this more, if you're still unclear.  My undergrad was in Medical Microbiology and Immunology and I'm currently getting my Master's in infectious disease epidemiology, so I love talking about this stuff."
11720,"Even if the newest research shows it can prevent cervical cancer, and is now recommended to women up to 45? Especially in those cells that pap smears typically don't detect. For me, that was the only reason I got it (and it was free). I personally could care less about the sexually transmitted things. I have one partner, I'm set to marry and neither of us stray. "
11721,"Add to that, you still need regular screenings for HPV since other strands also cause cancer.  I'd rather get screened and then get treatment if I do get a HPV strain.  Considering my low number of sexual partners and the fact that I do not intend to have more than a few, I am probably lower risk than those who have a higher number of partners.

Also, in the US, dying from cervical cancer is not so common.  Avoiding the vaccine won't necessarily save my life, while the inherent risks of a new vaccine rushed through the FDA could be unpleasant in the future."
11722,"Your first link is a seriously flawed movie (see criticisms of it [here](http://movies.nytimes.com/2011/11/18/movies/the-greater-good-review.html) and [here](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/the-greater-good-pure-unadulterated-anti-vaccine-propagand/).)

Your second video is not saying at all what you're implying.  In fact, she's saying the opposite.  She's saying that not everyone with HPV gets cancer and it's a slow process, but it happens to a high enough number of women that the vaccine would still be important.

""SaneVax.org"" is an anti-vaccine website.  Your two links to them are rife with methodological errors (in the case of the vaccine being ""tied to infertility"", which is really just a case study of three women and has no statistical power whatsoever) and poor science.

The study in PlosONE about autoimmune disorders was done on mice.  I'd also like to note that it wasn't ""normal"" levels of vaccination that caused those reactions, but mice vaccinated with 8x the normal dosage.  Mice vaccinated at 2x the normal dosage recovered just fine.  In addition, the ""vaccine"" they were using was staphylococcus enterotoxin B.  That's not a vaccine, it's a [biological weapon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcal_Enterotoxin_B).  So, yeah, if you dose mice with weaponized toxins at 8x the level of antigens that any vaccine has, maybe they end up with issues.  I don't see how that translates to human vaccine research.

The gaia-health article (in addition to being on a known anti-vax site) just compares infant mortality rates with vaccination rates.  This type of ecological study is basically incapable of proving any sort of causal link, especially the way they did it.

And finally, your study on the ""dangers and pointlessness"" of the HPV vaccine, which is by an author who regularly publishes quack articles on the ""safety"" of vaccines.  ([Here's](http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/2011/12/08/and-global-warming-is-caused-by-the-decr/) a nice takedown of one of his other articles)  Your article is behind a paywall, so I can't say exactly, but I'm willing to bet good money it'd have similar issues.

11723,I didn't get HPV from having sex with women. 
11724,Did you include the wrong paper? This one doesn't mention vaccination at all. 
11725,will I need to get a booster or something if I already have gotten the currently available vaccination?
11726,Very interesting about the clinical trial. Do you have any more information on it? I don't see on that link anywhere it says it is a 9 strain vaccine. Is there anything available on the Phase I and II trials?
11727,"MMI represent indeed! Yeah, I obviously don't have the self-restraint that you do, haha.  There was so much misinformation in this post and while I'm never fully confident that I'm the best person to do so (it's the anti-Dunning-Kruger effect!), I can't help but try."
11728,"[11 or 12 is the current recommended age](http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/vaccine.html) to start the series of 3 shots, so your daughter is the perfect age.  :)"
11729,"It's tough to argue against the whole ""it's too new"" argument because the question is when does a vaccine become ""old-enough"" for people to be okay with it?  It's pretty likely that a lot of the people saying that it's ""too new"" are just looking for an excuse.

People aren't necessarily okay with our ""older"" vaccines--MMR especially has a bad rap because of the bogus thimersol debate.

And some of the vaccines that people seem most fond of are our very *worst*.  People act like the smallpox vaccine was perfect and flawless because it lead to eradication, but it had worse side effects than any vaccine on the market.  It was terrible!

Gardasil started Phase 3 testing (the last, big phase before getting approved) in 2002.  It's been used and tested for over 10 years.  That's ""long enough"" to see most serious side effects.  In 1998 a rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield) caused a handful of cases of intussusception and was withdrawn within 14 months.  That's *fast* and also pretty standard.  Epidemiology is a strong tool.  Much stronger than people give it credit for.

Is there a remote chance that either of the HPV vaccines could cause some sort of disease in 30 years time?  I guess anything's theoretically possible.  But it's not as if this is brand new technology: other than the individual antigens vaccines are all much the same.  Unlike a brand new drug that uses brand new mechanisms to treat a problem, we understand the mechanisms by which vaccines cause immunity very well.  So I don't think that it's at all likely that there could be serious side effects down the road.  If there were side effects we'd have seen them already."
11730,"True but I'm pretty sure the cost is prohibitive.

A decision she's glad she made due to (possible) future increased shingles chances. 
Did you know that the chicken pox is going the way of the mumps/measles? ie: quiet rare. I didn't realize that until the kids I babysat several years ago actually asked me what the chicken pox was like. I said ""itchy"". They had no idea. "

11738,"Have you ever done the research and lined up the documented risks of getting the vaccine against the risks of the treatment that would be necessary if you do get a precancerous, or god forbid cancerous, lesion? 

Cervical cancer may not kill a lot of people any more but thousands of women every year get diagnosed with early changes, precancerous lesions, and undergo treatment for those. The rate of complications from these procedures (including life changing complications such as chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and inability to carry a pregnancy to term, is low. But it still represents a much greater risk than having the vaccine."

11742,"Good question. Really good question. Complex answer. 

(This is my opinion, not medical advice...)

You don't ""need"" a booster, but it may provide additional protection if you're still sexually active with different partners. The benefit will be diminished if you've previously been sexually active, but it still may offer some benefit. 

Personally, I'd be indifferent, because by the time it comes out I'll be older and less likely to have new partners and more likely to have previous exposure. So, while there is no real downside (sore arm) I'm aware they'll be charging a premium ($120 ?) for a product that is either:

* limited use to me (as I'm less sexually active i.e. no longer a teenager / in early 20s)
* will not provide full protection because I've been previously exposed.

Does that make sense?

But it really is a personal choice. I'm very pro-vaccination, but think people should make informed choices. 

I guess part of it is that I think Merck are price gouging. It cost less than $10 to make, and they're making a billion dollars a year. It's a good vaccine, it saves lives, the newer one will be even better -- but they're profit taking because of the word ""cancer"".

Considering that nearly everyone gets HPV, 5% of people with HPV getting a precancerous lesion is HUGE. That is not ""unlikely"".  That's incredibly likely.  That's millions of people.  That's a better chance of getting cancer than getting it from SMOKING.

SaneVax may *say* they want safe vaccines, but anyone with sufficient reading comprehension can see how their agenda is strongly anti vaccine.

>we also know that vaccines cause autoimmune diseases in humans

False."
11753,"Both men and women carry HPV, and the more people are vaccinated, the more effective the vaccine is. HPV doesn't just mean cervical cancer. It can cause cancer in men as well- in the mouth, throat, genital region, anus."
11754,"Herd immunity is good. Sometimes the vaccine isn't 100% effective on that person for whatever reason! It's rare-ish, but happens. But if everyone else has the vaccine, then that person is still safe. That's why it's good for everybody to get vaccinated!

Also, why a man might want to get the vaccine: for the same reason a really healthy adult might want to get a flu shot. Maybe the flu isn't so dangerous for *you*, but it could be for any children or elderly or pregnant people you accidentally pass it on to. Since men might never even know if they have HPV, they might have no idea if they're passing it on to a partner. With the vaccine, they can be reasonably sure they don't have it, and thus that their partners are safe. "
11755,"> I am sorry are you a woman? Maybe I misunderstood? If you are, wouldnt you getting the vaccine prevent you from getting hpv just the same as if the male were vaccinated? If you are a male, what is the risk of hpv to you?

female: Vaccines don't give you 100% coverage. If we're both vaccinated, less chance of me getting anything. 

male: I'm not an asshole and would feel very guilty if my future wife or whatever was infected and had her reproductive organs removed because I passed an easily-preventable virus to her. If I'm gay, I don't want to reach retirement age and have to go get ugly large growths removed from my butt thanks to all that awesome butt secs I'm having (a lot of my friends are in med school). "

also, if I'm being pedantic, and I am. you used the wrong you're/your on word 5 of your post.

but anyway. 

herd immunity doesn't work if enough people like you rely on society to take up the slack instead of working with everybody to make it happen. this kind of thing only works if everybody plays along and does their part.

it's just a disease, get your kid immunized. if you don't he could die of a number of different HPV associated cancers when he is older. "
11765,"It takes several months to a year for the injection series to be complete. If you're willing to wait that long before any oral or genital contact, great. 

But wait, let's say you're dating someone. You're OK with saying ""sorry, no sex or kissing until you get this vaccine that I believe can kill someone""?  "
11766,"If you think the vaccine is unsafe, why would you recommend it for women? If you think it's safe for women, and the studies are approving it for men as well, why would you not support men getting it?"
11767,"Throat cancer derived from hpv can easily be prevented by not performing cunnilingus on someone who hasnt been vaccinated.  Again, I am only stating that I feel the benefit for men is less than the risks."
11768,Yes herd immunity does work this way with stds.  There is a world of difference for herd immunity depending on how something is spread.  I said as a parent because I am over the age to get the shot so the only person I will be deciding for is my son.  My concern is that the immunization is more likely to kill him than the disease.
11769,I think that according to the cdc study it has a .1% chance of causing death.  This is higher than the risk of death from HPV for men but much lower for women.  This is why I see a benefit for women and not men.
11770,"Yeah, that's the heartbreaking thing. 

Do young men not care enough about the women they have sex with to take steps to prevent their future wife, long-term girlfriend, people they care about, from getting at best an expensive growth removed, and at worse, having to deal with the fear and uncertainty of cancer? In the western world, HPV-related cancers are rarely lethal if caught early. It still sucks, it's still expensive, and it's still scary. 

Also, no matter the sex, a lot of people perform oral sex and can be infected in the mouth. These people then go on to kiss a variety of dates, who then kiss other people, further spreading the virus without ever having sex. "
11771,"Well then, cervical cancer derived from hpv can be easily prevented by not having sex with someone who hasn't been vaccinated. The problem is, that's not a reasonable thing to request. Abstinence is not a practical plan for society to rely on, nor should it be."
11772,This is silly. Women are getting HPV from men. I suppose cervical cancer from hpv can easily be prevented not having sex with a man who hasn't been vaccinated. The logic works both ways. 
11773,"well, these are risks we take. 

you drive your son in a car despite that he is way more likely to die in a car accident than from a reaction to a vaccination. I presume you also allow him to play outside with out wrapping him in bubble wrap beforehand. you're also the adult, you get to make decisions like this. 

and herd immunity works the same way no matter what the disease is. everybody has to do their part. although if your son happened to get HPV it would be less likely to kill him, (this is presuming he didn't get anal or oral cancer from it) but it might kill the girls he sleeps with. are their deaths acceptable to you?

if you've gotten him vaccinated against everything else, and he hasn't had any reactions, he's unlikely to have a reaction to this one. "
11774,"You're citing a report that says 32 deaths have been correlated with (not caused by) the HPV vaccine, versus millions of shots given, and you're calling that 0.1%?

That's some interesting math.

You also need to look up ""herd immunity"" and understand that your hypothetical daughters (bog help them) will be better protected if the nation's hypothetical sons are also vaccinated. "
11775,They should care by informing their wife or partners that they should be vaccinated and by not performing oral sex on someone not vaccinated.  I dont see a problem with this.
11776,No it can be easily prevented by getting vaccinated as a woman.  What you are saying is that I should risk my sons life for something that has little benefit for him so his future wife wont have to be vaccinated or on the rare chance her vaccination might not work.  That doesnt sound right.
11777, I drive him in a car because the benefit he recieves from the transportation is greater than the risk of death.  It is all about expected value.  This is why only people traveling to countries with malaria are given the shot to prevent malaria.  It would not kill the girl he sleeps with if she had the shot.
11778,"I am citing the percentage given by the report.  I actually have studied behavioral economics so I do understand what I am talking about as well.  The report also mentioned that the number of deaths is on par with those from other vaccines as well, which is why you dont just hand out vaccinations to anyone unless they have a larger benefit for the individual.  I also find it strange the report only compared the background noise for women and not men and took into account age, race, sex, and regionality but not sexual orrientation when reporting cancer rates.  If there are issues it is with the cdc report and not my math given that I am well trained in validating models."
11779,"If the *men* were vaccinated, there would be even less of a problem. Why should the burden of protection for *everyone* fall solely on the shoulders of women?"
11780,I would imagine a vaccine to be the least grave of all the possible things in the world which have a larger chance of killing him. Why just draw the line there?
11781,"again, herd immunity, she can have the shot and it can fail. and not every girl gets the shot because they have parents who are like you, worried more about unlikely bullshit and denying that their children will ever be sexually active, than legitimate threats to their child's long term safety. 

would you rather your kid had his own lifevest when going out on a boat, or rely on the other people you've never met to have one for him? you can't control all the threats out there in the world.

seriously though, if your son gets the bad kinds of HPV they'll still give him cancer, and getting warts makes it easier to get infected with other STDs"
11782,"[The Journal of the American Medical Association](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=184421) published a post-licensure review of the HPV vaccines. At the time of the research, >23 million doses of HPV vaccine had been administered. The found 32 reports of deaths. The research found:

> The 32 death reports were reviewed and there was no common pattern to the deaths that would suggest they were caused by the vaccine. In cases where there was an autopsy, death certificate, or medical records, **the cause of death could be explained by factors other than the vaccine. Some causes of death determined to date include diabetes, viral illness, illicit drug use, and heart failure.**

Even assuming these 32 were related to HPV vaccination (which they do not appear to be), this would make the likelihood of death from the vaccine 0.000001% per dose, far below the risk for HPV-related cancers."
11783,"If [this]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19690307/) is the report you're citing, then you're remembering it wrong. 

What it says is, for every 100,000 doses, 0.1 deaths were reported (literally one in a million), or 0.0001%. 
A rate of 0.1% would be one in a thousand. Do you really think they would keep distributing a vaccine like that? Didn't that sound a bit off to you, even if you remembered the number 0.1?

When you cite data, you should really be looking at the data.  

And I've studied behavioral econ, too. Which is exactly why I understand that narrow self-interest is not always in my best interest. "
11784,Larger than the benefit to him being the key here.
11785,"Again, you are telling me I should risk his life to help benefit the women he would sleep with because they either did not get the vaccine themselves or there is an off chance it might not have worked for them.  If all women are vaccinated the disease would not be transfered among the heterosexual and lesbian populations because it is a sexually transmitted disease.  

If carrying a life vest also came with a risk that 20% of the people carrying it died versus him having a 10% chance of dying from drowning I would not let him carry a life vest.  If however, he had a 21 or greater % chance of dying from drowning I would make him carry a life vest. That is exactly what this situation is."
11786,"And that would then change the fact that I would have my son vaccinated.  The website I was reading took the .1 out of 100,000 as .1%.  

It still doesn't explain though why they only compared the background noise to other vaccinations and not a different sample without vaccinations, or why they also only did so for females.

Edit:  [They also do not recommend males be vaccinated.](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5920a5.htm)"
11787,"So did you read the link where it clearly stated that males need not be vaccinated for the herd to still be immune, or did you plan to gloss over that part?"
11788,"I am. get your kid vaccinated. 

by not doing so you're still relying on other people to be smarter, or at least less risk-averse, than you yourself are. that's just you not carrying your weight for society and expecting other people to do the work for you.

that's what I have a problem with. you feel entitled to everyone but you and your family having to do the work of keeping everyone safe, you want the benefits of modern medicine without having to do the work to stem the tide. 

that's what I don't respect about your opinion.

also, you're percentages of risk are off by a factor of about a hundred.

I got the call to be a bone marrow donor today. talking with you and being astonished by your immense selfishness has cemented my feeling that donating, despite that it will be painful for me, is the right thing to do.

so, thanks for that."
11789,"You are reading an old MMWR. [Here is the latest recommendation:](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6050a3.htm)

> On October 25, 2011, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended routine use of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil, Merck & Co. Inc.) in males aged 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommended vaccination with HPV4 for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series; males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated.

That MMWR also reports that the vaccine can prevent 7,000 HPV 16- and 18-associated cancers in males every year, which were increasing at a rate of ""1% per year for oropharyngeal cancers and 3% per year for anal cancers"" in the pre-vaccine era (1973-2007), as well as >90% of the 250,000 genital wart cases in U.S. males (when receiving HPV4).

Again, very strong evidence of vaccine efficacy and safety.

[You can read all the ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination here.](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hpv.html)"
11790,"I'm not glossing it, and you're changing the subject. You were wrong about the death rate. Also, that abstract is about 7 years old. The CDC and NIH, along with other international bodies,  have since decided that outcomes could be improved by adding male immunizations. If you'd like to update us on the death rate, I'm all ears. 

Incidentally,  have you compared that 0.0001% correlation with death to the known rate of death from HPV-related cancers in men? That's anal, penile, and some percentage of oral cancers? I have no idea of the number myself,  but it would certainly make an interesting comparison and be actually *relevant* to the conversation,  instead of the paranoid, anti-vax, slut-shaming that tends to arise around the topic."
11791,"You, go get your malaria shots right now.  Go get every other vaccine and shot out there also, regardless of how it may or may not be a benefit to you.  Also go gamble your entire paycheck at a casino.  Put everything down on one number at the roulette wheel.  You should do this since you obviously don't care about chance and are only concerned with the maximum outcome.  Did you even read the life vest analogy that perfectly represents this?  If so do you have any reply to it?  

I think you should donate your bone marrow.  The reason why is the probablility someones life will be saved versus someone dying is much greater if you donate compared to doing nothing.  This is not the case in the other scenario.  

Edit: [Maybe hearing it from someone else will help](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5920a5.htm)"
11792,"That is because currently the percentage of the female population vaccinated is so low.  Nothing changed between this report and the one in 2010 except the fact that they realized women arent being vaccinated.  I also like how this is just thrown in at the very end of their paper: 

>Although the largest number of HPV-associated cancers occur in women (approximately 15,000 HPV 16- and 18-associated cancers each year), an estimated 7,000 HPV 16- and 18-associated cancers occur each year in men in the United States. These include anal, oropharyngeal, and penile cancers. HPV4 has high efficacy for prevention of genital warts, AIN1/2/3, and AIN2/3 in males. HPV4 also has high efficacy for prevention of genital warts, CIN1/2/3 or AIS, CIN2/3, VIN2/3, and VaIN2/3 in females. Although data show HPV4 prevents various outcomes, no data are available on the efficacy for prevention of oropharyngeal or penile cancers. Vaccination of males would provide direct benefits and likely would reduce HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 transmission, and resulting infection, disease, and cancers in females (through herd immunity). However, no clinical efficacy data demonstrating that HPV4 prevents HPV transmission are available.

"
11793,What exactly is your argument?
11794,"My argument was two parts.  One being that for stopping the spread of an std in a population it is not neccessary to have both men and women vaccinated but only one of the two, which is also stated in the paper.

The second and more important argument was that medicine should do more good than harm if it is to be given."
11795,"> One being that for stopping the spread of an std in a population it is not neccessary to have both men and women vaccinated but only one of the two, which is also stated in the paper.

This presumes several things, the most erroneous of which is that it presumes all people are only engaging in sexual relations with members of the opposite sex.

> The second and more important argument was that medicine should do more good than harm if it is to be given.

Who is arguing otherwise?"
11796,"I'm confused. It's not even free for women? Not saying men shouldn't get it, but like - free HPV vaccines for some, miniature american flags for everyone else?"
11797,Studies are still being done for men on it's effectiveness.
11798,"It's not even that expensive. It's about $120 a shot, you need 3 shots over 6 months and that averages to $60 a month. Just get it yourself."
11799,"Free for girls in a certain age range (grade eight, for sure). Boys in that age range should also get it."
11800,Has there *ever* been a vaccine that was effective for one sex but not the other?
11801,"Except you need to get it at a fairly young age (preferably before sexual activity).  $120 x3 is a lot for a middle school age boy to pay, or for his family.  It represents almost an entire month's worth of welfare aid for a poor family, for example."
11802,"Some insurance covers Gardasil. I, male, 23, got 80% off from a ManuLife insurance plan. "
11803,60$ a month goes a long way for some people.
11804,"Oh really? If girls are getting it for free, boys def should too. When I looked into it for myself it was like $500"
11805,The HPV vaccine is 100% effective on males for preventing cervical cancer. 
11806,[deleted]
11807,"There are a lot of issues with getting everyone vaccinated for it, such as the fact that there are 30 to 40 strains. Female people are prioritized because they have *significantly* more to lose from complications. Take a look at Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus

I know it's not good to take Wikipedia for granted, but there are many studies and I can't really access them without a subscription. I'm sure you can find other sites that will say the same based on the same or other studies, though."
11808,Yeah. It's completely unfair to boys. If they contract HPV wouldn't they be spreading it to other males and females also. It's extremely unfair practice.
11809,"You smoked too much then.

That aside, do you have kids? Imagine trying to support a family of 4 on one meager salary, like many immigrants do. $60 is a lot."

11811,Public Health is of the opinion that boys should receive it too 
11812,"But that's ignoring that women will catch it *from* men.

If the idea is that we need to protect women before men, and quite frankly that's a pretty sexist idea on both fronts, it would only help serve that purpose by ensuring that all avenues of infection are covered, and that includes 50% of the populace who currently aren't covered."
11813,What's fair is our public tax dollars being used as efficiently as possible.  
11814,We need a license for couples to have kids... seriously. But that's another story.
11815,"Lol. Such ignorance. They do studies looking in to funding for these types of things. Cost-benefit analyses. It's way more likely to cause cancer in females so that's why they receive it. Because in males, the virus is typically cleared by the body within 2 years. However they can still carry it and pass it, but any female partners would be vaccinated.

You can't just say it's unfair. Fine. Fund it for males too, but some other medication or service that was previously covered now can no longer be. Which one prevents mortality more for less money? Oh you want both funded? Ok taxes will go up. Oh..."
11816,You ever heard of immigrants coming to Canada with a PHD then driving a cab?
11817,[deleted]
11818,"Alright, I'm cool with taxes going up if it means better medical care for the province."
11819,"Thanks for telling me to do some more reading, it seems you really know your wikipedia.

Here is the distribution of cancers for those that are attributable to HPV: cervix (60.5%), vulva/vagina (13.7%), penis (2.4%), anus (21.7%), mouth (0.9%), oropharynx (0.8%). So as you can see, almost 75% of HPV-related cancers can ONLY affect women. That means of the other 25%, say half will affect women and half men, so around 90% of HPV cancers affect women and only around 10% actually affect men.

Additionally, 90% of HPV infections clear on their own by the body within 2 years.

You just saying ""recently some news of males getting cancers from HPV"" means nothing.

Now look, I'm not saying males shouldn't be vaccinated, I'm just saying with the funding available its a better decision to vaccinate them over men.

One thing that is being looked at is that instead of 3 shots being necessary, only 2 may be needed to provide the same amount of protection, which would free up money to fund vaccinations for males."
11820,"But how much better does the medical care have to be to justify the expense?  Vaccinating men would only provide a slight marginal increase of public health.  And keep in mind, this isn't the only instance of medical professionals having to make these sorts of decisions.  Taxes would have to go **way** up to fund all of these marginal increases in public health.         
       
But I feel like a lot of this isn't about providing the best public health and is more about people feeling entitled to everything else someone else gets."
11821,Fuck. That.
11822,No. It's about being entitled to proper medical care. It's about being willing to pay a bit more if it means a better quality of life. And it's about shifting our priority away from hoarding our wealth and towards creating a better Canada.
11823,"You're just repeating yourself without answering the question.  It's not about paying a bit more for increased services.  It's about paying a bit more then a bit more then a bit more...     
      
The sky is the limit.  We could take our entire military budget and put it into health care and we could still run out of funding. So, where do you draw the line?  "
11824,"Men, if you are listening: get the vaccine! I think it's absolutely ridiculous from a public health standpoint that the vaccine isn't covered for men (here in Canada) but IS covered for women, seeing as it is a sexually transmitted disease. That's like saying, we will only treat 50% of people with syphilis. It's cool, the other half will figure it out. If you are an adolescent male, and have the $$, I would strongly recommend it! HPV can give you genital warts, and it can also potentially give your female partner cervical cancer down the road. Also genital warts. Did you hear me when I said genital warts? You should get the vaccine. "
11825,"My son took all 3 rounds by 15 year birthday.

Wife is a Community Health Nurse and was a no-brainer."
11826,"Yes, and I've had my son vaccinated, after discussing it at length with his pediatrician. I want him and his future partners to be protected from HPV."
11827,"Yeah, apparently throat cancer is on the rise for men as a result of HPV.

http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/news/20130723/single-men-show-higher-risk-of-cancer-linked-oral-hpv"
11828,"Yeah, too bad it's not been shown to have significant effects for someone over 26 like me. Also, I think it's less likely to be covered by insurance for guys since they tend to not get cervical cancer from HPV. "
11829,I was listening to NPR piece on the HPV vaccine a month or two ago. Apparently one of the biggest issues is how few males had gotten the vaccine (8% of eligible males vaccinated versus about 50% of females). According to the piece the recommended age range for males is 13-26. I'll be talking to my doctor about it soon.
11830,Good to know. 
11831,"Yea it takes care of I think, 2-4 of the major HPV strains in men. And in canada it costs like $500 or something for 3 shots over the course of a year."
11832,"Yep, it's a 3 part vaccine (You have to get 3 shots on different occasions.) and will take about 2 years to finish, but it exists. "
11833,What exactly is this shot for? I got it done when I was younger but didnt know what it was for
11834,"I am pretty young can anyone give me info on this, will all doctors have these, are they expensive why don't people always get it?"
11835,"Yeah, I just recently got it because my insurance covers it and my doctor recommended it. Apparently its a new thing that they recently started doing (for men, that is.)"
11836,Is there a test for men to determine whether or not they have HPV?
11837,"I had it. As far as I know, it wasn't that bad. The purpose isn't necessarily to preserve my well-being, but to insure that I can't be a carrier and give it to a woman who could eventually get cervical cancer as a result."
11838,"I had it done. In fact, I'm scheduled for a booster shot soon."
11839,yes sir. I'm on my first of three parts of it.
11840,"Gardasil/Silgard - Merck

Ceravix - GSK

The instance of severe side effects from this vaccine is pretty high. 

It was made mandatory in texas and then stopped due to side effects.
In other countries, such as japan, it was banned.

4% deaths from cervical cancer and gardasil claim to reduce that by 70%..so 1%. Not a big change

Polio, TB and hepatitis on the other hand.

"
11841,"Yeah, it should be covered."
11842,"Don't make me go get the research on the relative public health benefits between the sexes. It's been done by several governments.

Basically, preventing a female from getting HPV has a benefit large enough to be worth the government paying for it. It doesn't for an individual male. Remember that this is a sexually transmitted disease, so vaccinating all of one sex, + 2 generations means you have almost completely wiped out the disease."
11843,Throat cancer. 
11844,"The vaccine only protects against a couple types of HPV. I think there are 15+ types. 
"
11845,"It's not that it doesn't work for men over 26, it's just that statistically by the age of 26, most people already have HPV."
11846,"Well, a lot of people do not even know it exists.  I read via Googling that for men it isn't always covered by insurance and it is expensive."
11847,"I'm not sure if men get them on the same schedule as women, but when I got it, it only took 6 months. You get #1, wait two months, get #2, wait four months, and get #3."
11848,HPV is a veneral disease that can cause some cancers.
11849,"People don't always get it because it's really expensive, or they don't feel the need because some people are just careless about their happy parts. 

Most doctors should have this vaccine. If yours does not, they will be able to put you in contact with one that does. 

"
11850,"They don't normally test men because its painful and the only ""bad"" thing that can happen is warts. Women get tested every time they get a Pap smear. 

If you are sexually active and age 26 or younger, PLEASE look into this. Something like 80% of Americans have some strain of HPV. Many are harmless, but certain strains cause cervical cancer in women. The vaccine protects against several of these strains. So while you may never have any negative effects, a woman you sleep with could. "
11851,"That's fine and dandy, but I would prefer to be protected myself in this generation."
11852,Or the vaccine isn't needed after 26 to eventually make it almost extinct in the next few generations. Same reason only to recommend/subsidize the vaccine for women.
11853," I didn't even know it existed until I hear the NPR piece. It really should be covered by insurance, considering the health benefits it has for both men and women. "
11854,"I've gotten number 2, I got #1 about 5 months ago, and I'm scheduled to get #3 in December. "
11855,HPV can also cause genital warts.  
11856,expensive even with insurance? 
11857,Why the cap at 26?  Does the vaccine not work on older men?
11858,"Actually, men can get throat cancer from HPV."
11859,I would say we are both correct. Good point.
11860,"I didn't even know about it until yesterday.

Last year I was suprised to learn that the flu vaccine wasn't covered by my insurance.   You would think it would be since 1 - 2 weeks of lost work is expensive.  Luckily, the vaccine was affordable without insurance."
11861,"I don't know, honestly. I don't have health insurance. I got mine through the uni, so they were free. Just call! Your doctor will have all the answers."
11862,"It's not an absolute cap, at least not in the US. The reason they have that number is because most people who are sexually active have already been exposed to it by 26. Some people still get it though, there's no harm in getting it."
11863,It's very rare. Technically they can get rectal cancer from it too. 
11864,I am in uni too I will ask uni doctor too.
11865,"Ak okay, they figure ""why bother"" since most Americans already have it by that point.   I will have to give my insurance company a call and see if I can afford it.  Thanks for the food info."
11866,"I read it's on the rise. Either way, it's better to be safe."
11867,I got mine free because I landed in a certain income bracket. It was a program that ran alongside my uni's health clinic that paid for it. 
11868,"I agree males should be vaccinated too, but all of this (as with all medical reporting) is a bit misleading; offering Gardasil was controversial enough when it began and it's no wonder it started this way. Women are at higher risk because of cervical and vulvar cancer as well as maternal infection of the fetus. The cesarean section rate has increased to avoid transmission during vaginal birth. Those are bigger risks than for males, that's just a fact. And the HPV vaccine is available to males too, as well as older women and men, it's just not covered under OHIP; the province is examining doing so. I think it was less a cost factor alone and more the fact it was hard enough to sell parents on vaccinating their daughters, hell, it still is. Gardasil remains controversial and is blamed for reactions in females who have received it.

So no, it's not just a tightfisted province neglecting the health of boys. It's a hard vaccine to implement thus far with controversial opinions, and as usual the Post is doing its shoddy medical reporting solely to rake up muck. This paper does a horrible job on medical reporting regularly. This MRA type post title isn't helping."
11869,"It is available to males, but if you don't have insurance that covers it, it is very expensive. "
11870,[deleted]
11871,">Canadian Medical Association, the Canadian Cancer Society and the National Advisory Committee on Immunization have been petitioning the Ontario government to cover the cost of the HPV vaccine for boys

>Alberta and Prince Edward Island already cover the cost of the immunizations for both boys and girls, and so too will Nova Scotia as of this coming fall. And there’s good reason for that: doctors say that the rates of oral cancers among men have risen dramatically over the past several years, with HPV present in about two-thirds of cases. 

This issue seems pretty black and white. We have a vaccine we can use to prevent mouth and throat cancer. Instead of using it to help males, we have people such as /u/Zaneris who believe boys should only be protected through ""herd immunity"".

Am I the only one disturbed by that mentality? 

Vaccination is not controversial. Paying 400$ per dosage is pennies in terms of preventative medication. 

EDIT:

Please don't try and derail this important discussion by labeling it as a MRA type issue. This is about health and safety. 

If we develop a vaccine for HIV/AIDS and we only gave it to men, saying that ""herd immunity"" would protect women, would you stand for that?"
11872,It's about 100 dollars a year over a four year period. That's not terribly expensive. 
11873,"This is the idea, but because it's been difficult thus far to get parents of girls to comply, it's not the current reality. I agree with vaccinating males because of this."
11874,[deleted]
11875,"The title is written in MRA fashion; I object to that. 

Cervical and vulvar cancers as well as fetal transmission are still bigger risks than oropharyngeal carcinoma comparatively. Only 1% of people with oral HPV have the type associated with carcinoma (type 16). Part of the reason only females were offered the vaccine is because if enough of them get it, males are therefore secondarily protected. This is flawed and doesn't account for gay males transmitting HPV, of course.

I'm not saying it shouldn't happen, I think it should, and likely it will; the province isn't stupid and knows that 400 dollars of vaccines is still cheaper than surgical/oncology care, but policy has to be written, risks and benefits analysed, and education implemented. Considering how resistant parents have been to vaccinating their daughters, it's a flawed project at best, anyhow. It's just not likely top priority considering how resistant parents are for their daughters anyhow. 

My objection is to how this article paints it as some sort of gross neglect on the part of the provincial government, instead of being a vaccine fraught with controversy and noncompliance."
11876,Vaccines don't help people who already have the disease. They help prevent it from manifesting. So the discussion of boys who already have it is irrelevant. 
11877,[deleted]
11878,[deleted]
11879,"And if you don't currently have it but want to prevent it, you're out of luck."
11880,"OP wrote the title of this post, not the newspaper. "
11881,"Public health isn't a matter of what feels more PC or how equality plays into it. You have a finite amount of resources and a finite budget, you allocate them to have the best impact possible. Keeping that in mind it's better to treat women with the vaccine, because of it's efficacy and epidemiology of the disease itself. It isn't that the government hates boys and prioritizes girls over them... it's a matter of spending your resources as best as possible. I'm a man, and not some feminist either, so don't think I'm speaking out of a proverbial vagina. If the community at large was better served by giving the vaccine to men alone, that's exactly what would be done.

As far as preventing it is concerned, don't be overly promiscuous, condoms and dental dams, and get yourself and your partner tested. If you're still scared practice abstinence. "
11882,"That's somewhat incorrect. You can still get HPV even without barrier protection. And abstinence really shouldn't ever be considered an option in any case. Only vaccinating females neglects the fact there is male to male sexual transmission, as well as poor compliance thus far for females with the vaccine. This is why I agree with males being vaccinated too, but it's stupid to blame it solely on cost alone."
11883,"Good. Males can develop certain cancers through HPV as well (and a vaccine doesn't always confer immunity regardless, so if we're vaccinating females it only makes sense to vaccinate males as well for greatest efficacy) so I'm glad to hear it will be offered to boys."
11884,"For those too lazy to read the article: Prince Edward Island was the first.

11885,"Despite the vaccine being more effective in females, it only seems right to offer it to males too "
11886,"I was told about the HPV vaccines by someone in Alberta. I live in BC and I asked a doctor about getting one and he responded ""Those are for girls."". Felt really shitty to tell you the truth."
11887,"""The school-based program, offered for free, is voluntary and requires the consent of a parent or guardian.""

Does anyone know if Alberta has anything similar to British Columbia's Infants Act which basically gives minors the right to receive health care services including immunizations without a parent or guardian's permission?

If so I guess there will be a whole lotta derp to come from the Catholic school parents once they find out their sons and daughters can get the HPV vaccine no matter what the parents want. "
11888,Shouldn't all provinces cover this vaccine? Maybe someone can educate me on why it's so provincial when health care is always portrayed as a federal thing.
11889,"This bothers me, it's a good thing, but when I was in school and all the vaccines were being done my teacher told all the boys that they can't get their HPV shots because they don't get HPV. Now I realise she didn't even care to check if they could or not."
11890,"Plus, it provides herd immunity for women. Lots of men can get assymptomatic HPV and then pass it on to women.

I'm a bit curious how this works. Is it now mandatory or was it just not available before? My doctor had me get this done 2 years ago in Florida but I don't think it was mandatory for school or anything."
11891,"Herd immunity, my friend. I'm all for subsidizing vaccinations for gay men, but statistically speaking this has a very poor cost to benefit ratio."

Other forms of healthcare do not require a parents consent."
11895,"It is given to younger kids (9 to 12). In BC, several years ago my kids could go to the doctor at age 15 without my knowledge, so they would be past the optimal time for the vaccination. "

11900,"It's a relatively recent vaccine and part of the progressive approval for different populations is due to progressive funding/planning of trials and data collection (part of it is the wonderful ability to extend patent rights).

To my knowledge, in all jurisdictions, the vaccine against HPV is not part of the ""mandatory"" set of vaccines that schools currently might require or are heavily recommended, in the way MMR, Tdap, etc are. It is currently elective, like the HepA and B vaccines or other travel ones, but the HPV one is more highly recommended for the general population. It may become ""mandatory"" one day. "
11901,I'm not sure what you mean. This is for all men so that they don't spread HPV. There's no reason men shouldn't do it just as much as women- men just are generally assymptomatic carriers of the virus.
11902,Said the Albertan :P
11903,The optimal time for vaccination is any time before you have sex with an affected person (or get infected by other means).  Adults can get the vaccine as well.
11904,"Fourteen. New Brunswick has two, due to language politics."
11905,"It was elementary teachers, I was 11 so I hope now I have a bit better judgement."
11906,"Essentially, the premise is that by immunizing groups of people, non immunized people also become safer because there are fewer people to catch it from. This isn't a concept I'm making up, its a well studied phenomenon and is part of overall health strategy. 

Consider little johnny wants to become sexually active. If all of his female classmates were vaccinated before they became sexually active, who could he even get it from?

Obviously, if he starts having sex with women outside the protected group, he is put at risk (note risk doesn't imply certain death), but statistically speaking, most boys in high school (especially after so many years of vaccinations) will be having sex with women who have been immunized. I'm not saying its *bad* to vaccinate us men. I'm just saying that it isn't nearly as useful as you might think it is... not even close. The added benefit is negligable.



Edit:

Like I said before, this isn't some theory I have. It is plain science. I've provided a link to a scholarly article published in the Oxford Journal of Infectious Diseases on the subject. 

[Garnett, Geoffry.*Role of Herd Immunity in Determining the Effect of Vaccines against Sexually Transmitted Disease*](http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/191/Supplement_1/S97.short)

TIL That Canadians are just as resistant to forming opinions based on scientific reality as everyone else. I somehow let myself believe that our nature was more pragmatic and reasonable than our cultural counterparts. I'm really really heartbroken.
"
11907,"As a group, the optimal time to get the vaccine is before almost all the people have sex. But yes, as an individual, before having sex is fine. I wonder if many young people will bother to get it done if they do not get it done in school. "
11908,"Two healthcare systems?

That sounds like a nightmare."

11910,I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
11911,Why?
11912,"Oh, that whole comment was just incredibly ill-informed. Gaurdasil is not the most expensive vaccine in the world. It isn't cheap, don't get me wrong, but it isn't ""the most expensive in the world"".

I don't think they bothered to read the study I linked, either. This is REALLY sad because there is a very short summary on the landing page of that link. Wyvrn isn't grasping that the choice isn't between ""vaccinnating men"" and ""treating mens cancer"". The point of that scientific, peer reviewed study (AND OTHERS LIKE IT) is that by vaccinating women, you for all intents and purposes *are* vaccinating the men.

At the end, Wyvrn tops it all off by decreeing that the policy is sexist. Basically they said ""fuck *reading* and fuck *logic* and fuck *science*, this is a social justice issue!"" , thieving the decision making process from one of reason to one of passion.

And like, this is just how people are. To one degree or another we all let ourselves get seduced by a charismatic but substanceless call to action. I wish I could say that I don't do it too sometimes, but I do. I just like to think that when somebody presents me with a sobering reality check I'll actually clue in that hey, maybe I'm getting caught up in a line of totally bogous reasoning.

/rant 1

begin rant 2

Healthcare in this country is super important. We are going to have to make some really fucking serious desicions in the next 20 years or so about the future of healthcare in this country. When universal healthcare was founded, for each retired person, there was at least 1 person in thier prime tax-paying years to support the system.

Within 20 years, the ratio will be more like 3 to 1. The burden of the cost of health care is going to become almost unbearable, something that this country has never before experienced.

I am not willing to give up universal healthcare. This is a field I'm willing to die on.

That being said, for there to be any chance... any *prayer* that we can keep it, we're going to have to get a lot fucking smarter about how we run it.

This is just one example, of the *thousands* of desicions that we're going to have to make in the coming years that are going to determine weather or not our health care system collapses in on itself.

Knowing the dire need for sanity, I'm completely terrified to see the discussion around health care (the SCIENCE of health care!) to be some completely divorced from science! We can't afford to have this level of ignorance in the desicion making process. We can't.

and. ah. ahhhhhh... I'd better call it there. I'm just frustrated and very very very concerned. The way things are going, we are going to have some very major issues in the future, and I don't see anything moving in the correct direction to stop them."
11913,"Well, that was more than I expected lol But I agree with you."
11914,"The vaccine is not currently approved by the FDA for people 26 and older. No research shows the vaccine is effective in people over the age of 26. Unless you've never had a previous sexual partner, I don't see you being able to receive it. 

Also, generally people clear HPV from their bodies in a few years. If she's had repeated clean PAP smears, you should be ok. Unless she has recurring genital warts, then you will need to take appropriate precautions. If you are circumcised, that will also reduce your risk of transmission. "
11915,"there's really no reason you should get it. They like to give it to you before 24 years of age..because that chances of you already having come into contact with it after that are really super high. no point really in vaccinating because you've probably already contracted it or aren't going to get it. however, some place might. I know that planned parenthood has a sliding scale option for payments depending on your income. if they'll do it at your age. "
11916,"As a 36 year old male who is just beginning to have an actual sex life, do personal factors enter into it at all? I mean, they would give it to someone half my age, and in every measurable sense (past partner count, future planned promiscuity, etc) I'm at that point in my life. 

I just can't shake the feeling that it's irresponsible of me to not have this vaccine, but I'm incapable of getting it, so it's irresponsible of me to have sex. Is that logic flawed? How strict are the guidelines?"
11917,"I don't think they're super strict. I'm not sure. I do know that I was part of the study group her in Albuquerque, new mexico when they were doing the last trial for the vaccine. I know that I was 25 when the study was done...I was part of it for a total of 3-4 years. They had sent me a letter stating that the trial was complete and that the vaccination was proven effective however I didn't get the actual vaccine that I had received the placebo. When I went to both my primary doctor and the local planned parenthood both places told me I was past the age for it to be effective and there was no need in me getting it. 

side note: i'm a female. "
11918,"Part of the issue is that they want to gi've it to you before your immune system is done developing. That's why they recommend getting it as young as possible. You might find a doctor to give it to you, but it likely won't do anything."
11919,"Should probably mention that HPV is what's causing the throat cancer, not oral sex in general. Please take the sensationalism down a notch."
11920,Why would anyone smoke in a man?
11921,"""The decline in HPV-negative oral cancers mirrors the decline of smoking in the U.S., the study said.""  Sounds to me like more research is needed here. There's not a clear cause-effect being defined of HPV-positive oral cancers increasing on average in all men, only as a percentage of diagnosed cancers. "
11922,"Some people have said that the HPV vaccine has been received so poorly in the US because there is a systematic undervaluing of women's health.  As the argument goes, if HPV vaccines prevented cancer in men, then people would take them more seriously.  Well now that HPV has been linked to penile and throat cancer in men, they would predict a much higher uptake rate of the vaccine.  I can't wait to see what happens."

11945,"> Some people have said that the HPV vaccine has been received so poorly in the US because there is a systematic undervaluing of women's health.

11946,"low uptake because we are a puritan society, and this is promoting promiscuity.  just like how the anti-abortion fucktards don't give out free condoms on every fucking corner; it isn't completely about the ""life of a child"", it is about fucking you over for sinning.

There are also tests that can identify if the sample has at least one ""High risk"" HPV type."

11990,"The HPV virus that gardisil acts against mostly causes genital warts and VERY occasionally causes cervical cancer. I don't know the number of adolescent girls in Australia but that sounds like a pretty big bill. 

Of course you could almost wipe out HPV in a generation (at least locally) which would be a pretty awesome affect. 

Everything has a cost. And health is a relative thing. What are the death rates of cervical cancer vs. prostate cancer or breast cancer? It's naive to say any cost is fine as long as it's ""for the children"". That is why health costs are going through the roof in the US. I actually think it's a great vaccine but the cost of vaccinating every school girl in america is pretty intimidating. 

**Question:** How much will you pay for your health?

**Answer:** *Everything I've got!*"

11992,"Actually, [dihydrogen monoxide accounts for at least 7% of all injury related deaths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning).  It's especially dangerous to children.  Think of the children!"
11993,You should definitely discuss the issue with your physician in regards to getting the vaccine. It's unlikely that the doctor would order the test because even a positive result for a given HPV type doesn't necessarily mean that you have an infection that would lead to cancer. Genital HPV infections often clear without presenting symptoms.

While the shot is protective against genital wart HPV types in both men and women, only women received the shot. The conclusion of the authors is that herd immunity was responsible for the decline.

The (free) vaccination campaign was for school aged girls with a catch up program for women up to 26. I don't know of any other programs like it. Even though the vaccine is on the market, its list price is >$300 USD for the 3 shot regimen."

12002,If you fit the criteria - ABSOLUTELY!
12003,"YES! Guardasil protects against four types of HPV, two that are known to be linked to cervical cancer and two that are common causes of genital warts! Any form of vaccination in the male population serves to promote something called ""herd immunity"" or basically the eradication of a disease based on the majority of the population being able to fight it off. Its a great thing! and as long as you aren't a Bachman supporter I am sure you won't get mental retardation. "
12004,Someone posted [this article](http://webfarm.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-03/oral-sex-may-cause-virus-linked-throat-cancer-in-men-study.html) today; it indicates there's been an increase in throat cancer in men due to the HPV virus (which can be transmitted during oral sex).

12009,"A bit of conjecture here but I think the age cutoff has to do with your chances of prior exposure to HPV. That is, the older you are and the more sexual experiences you accumulate, the higher your chances are of infection. I found this in the literature:

A total of 27% of 16- through 26-year-old girls and women, 33% of 24- through 45-year-old women,
and 17% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men had evidence of prior exposure to or ongoing infection
with at least 1 of the 4 vaccine HPV types. Among these individuals, 74% of 16- through 26-year-old girls
and women, 71% of 24- through 45-year-old women, and 78% of 16- through 26-year-old boys and men
had evidence of prior exposure to or ongoing infection with only 1 of the 4 vaccine HPV types and were
naïve (PCR negative and seronegative) to the remaining 3 types.
In 24- through 45-year-old individuals, 0.4% had been exposed to all 4 vaccine HPV types.

It's worth a chat with a provider that is well versed in the details and nuances of Gardisil.
"
12010,"Thanks for the reply, apologies for taking long to reply myself.   
   
So would there be an issue with taking the vaccine if I've already been exposed to the HP virus? I certainly don't have symptoms, and haven't been exposed to it, as far as I know, but does what you put here mean that the vaccine is ineffective if you're already infected?"
12011,"copy pasta from a related web site:

What if I Already Have HPV?

If you have already been diagnosed with HPV you are still able to receive Gardasil. There are many different strains of the virus, and Gardasil can help protect you against other strains of the virus. However, Gardasil will not protect you against strains to which you have already been exposed. 

"
12012,"Yep.

I was 13 or 14 when Gardasil became available in Australia and I got all three rounds for free as part of the regular school vaccination program.

Preventative medicine is the best medicine."
12013,"Yes, I got all three a few years ago. No problems at all, and the people who claim that it causes HPV are highly misinformed-- the strain isn't even in the vaccine, just proteins for the antibodies. Get it."
12014,"I did. I didn't see a good reason not to, especially since I wasn't yet sexually active at the time, and it's supposed to be most beneficial for people who haven't had sex yet. "
12015,I got the first 2 and not the third...should I be worried about negative health consequences? Of I get it now I'll have to get all 3 again...
12016,I would get it.  I think it's a great vaccine.   But I'm too old.
12017,I got it when i was 14 or 15 because my mom figured it was a good idea. I ended getting hpv (one of the strains the virus doesn't protect against) years later anyway. Go figure.
12018,"Yes I did, probably almost a decade ago now, though I can't remember exactly.  There is literally no good reason not to."

It will protect against more strains of the virus, including those that are more likely to affect black women.

12021,I couldn't say. Ask your doctor.
12022,"Pity. Well, at least you can sleep soundly knowing that your mother gave you your best chance at avoiding it (short of lifetime celibacy)."
12023,I (adult male) got the first shot this morning and I had to all but talk my doctor into giving it to me. You'd have thought there was a downside (other than the sore arm)...
12024,Can you source your statement?
12025,This is anecdotal and has absolutely no significance in establishing a causal link between the vaccine and an increased risk of cancer. You ought to know better.
12026,"Your info is not only misleading, it's very wrong."
12027,Eh. Such is life. I think the shot is a great idea.
12028,"It's now being medically recommended for men as well as women, but they may not have recommended it for you specifically if you're already sexually active/above a certain age.  Good on you for pushing for it, advocating for your own health (and your future partners), and getting it though!  

From the CDC website:

>Gardasil was found to be safe and effective for males 9 -26 years. ACIP recommends routine vaccination of boys aged 11 or 12 years with 3-doses of Gardasil. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is recommended for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not already been vaccinated or who have not received all 3 doses. The vaccine is most effective when given at younger ages; males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated."

12032,"> It's been linked to actually causing cervical cancer as well as other side effects.

I just think statements like that can be really dangerous about something that is [so positive (the vaccine)](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm).  Especially since I did just google, and can't find anything, hence why I asked for your sources.  If your point is valid, I'd love to be educated, and I just don't believe that it is, and if people believe it blindly then they are going to not get the vaccine, which isn't good.  Saying things like ""girls in my nursing class, one of my nursing school instructors during an open conversation in the classroom"" isn't a reliable source.

Furthermore, when you say ""other side effects"", if you [look it up](http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/pages/hpv-vaccine-cervarix-gardasil-side-effects.aspx) they are all fairly mild and rare, especially when compared with something like preventing HPV and cervical cancer.

You can certainly make your own choices with your own body, and I'd never try to force otherwise, but I do think you need to be careful with statements like I've quoted above without backing them up.  "
12033,"> It's been linked to actually causing cervical cancer as well as other side effects. 

State source or don't make claims that are false."
12034,As far as I know (I'm not a doctor) it's not that there are risks but that at that point you are more likely to have already contacted HPV so it's less likely to be effective.
12035,[deleted]
12036,[deleted]
12037,"> Also, asking people after you have received the vaccine (as in today) isn't really fair to not mention in your opening question.

Just to clarify, I am not the OP, I was just responding to your post.

If you could actually link your source instead of copying and pasting, I'd appreciate it.

>Early studies merely showed that Gardasil is effective against just two strains of cancer-causing HPV

Actually, [Gardasil protects against 4 strains](http://www.webmd.com/vaccines/features/hpv-cervical-cancer-vaccine-15-facts), and Cervarix, the other HPV vaccine brand, protects against two.  No one has said differently.

>judging them when they answer

I apologize if you felt I was judging your choice.  Like I said, you make your own choices for your own health, and I wouldn't ever want to force you to do otherwise.  All I said, again, is that you should be careful about making medical statements like they are fact when they, frankly, aren't, and when believing them can impactful in someone else's decision making and potentially damaging to someone else's health.

Edit:  regarding vaccines in general, this is a [great listen](http://www.maximumfun.org/sawbones/sawbones-vaccines) for everyone."
12038,"This is just outright false and honestly disgraceful that you would post something that is a **terrible** source and has been refuted. The vaccine is incredibly safe, has not been linked to cervical cancer and the fact that you are in healthcare is even scarier. Shame on you."

12040,[deleted]
12041,">  Jesus, doesn't anyone have a right to ""free speech"" and a right to an opinion, especially when asked why they did or did not receive something?

Certainly, but you did outright say it's been linked to causing cervical cancer and that it has ""other side effects"" (the implication being serious ones) which is just plain false.  So that's a fact, and not an opinion.  Furthermore, stating you are a nursing student can make your opinion come off as true and some people may perceive your opinion as medical advice, so I just think you need to be careful."
12042,[deleted]
12043,"I don't want to keep pushing this because you seem to be getting upset and that was never my intention.  Like I've said multiple times, your choices are your own and I don't judge them nor so I want to force anything on you.  I just want you to be conscious of what you put out as a statement.

I do also think you need to understand that an abnormal pap isn't in any way the same as cervical cancer, and it isn't related to getting the vaccine.

You're a nursing student.  I think you need to do some more research, for your own sake."
12044,Odd that the article mentioned a few reasons why it would make sense to have this as a blanket vaccine but provided no details why the decision was made to restrict it to girls.
12045,"So, uh... can I get this vaccine too? I'm not in school but I still don't want HPV or genital warts either. Is this going to be available to anyone who wants it? "
12046,I'm glad you didn't link the Daily Mail article on this. I imagine they've set rage to maximum for this nugget. If only there was a way to implicate immigrant single mothers in this decision...
12047,[deleted]
12048,"Do not take any fucking immunisation, especially for this shit! "
12049,"I'm guessing that it's because, although both men and women can get HPV/warts, only women are at risk for serious complications from it.  Men can pass it on, of course, but women can get cervical cancer or have fertility issues because of it.  Considering the cost, they probably figure they'll vaccinate only the ones who will potentially be damaged the most by the virus; women.

Course that's all just a guess...

"
12050,They're switching the HPV vaccine (which only girls get) to one that also protects against genital warts
12051,"I was wondering why there's a distinction, though I imagine it'll be offered at the same time as the HPV vaccinations?

As the article mentions, the decrease in infections will result in fewer male issues eventually... I wonder if there's going to be a decrease *anyway* they've decided to save money by not immunising men too? But then they have the problem that gay men won't have the protection.

So yes, why not everyone? Plus it will reduce the number of potential infections from foreign non-vaccinated individuals. At the moment I can only conclude that money is the reason."
12052,"It's not sexist, if anything it's homophobic.

If girls are immune to getting it, then heterosexual boys will also not be getting it. It will only remain a problem for homosexual boys."
12053,People have been downvoting you. I'm not going to. I'm going to ask that you explain why you think immunisation is bad and should be avoided.
12054,"Nature's French ticklers!

Nothing wrong with a few warts on a penis. The thing with the cervix and cancer? Since when do warts give you cancer? I've had a few on my hands and face, and I've not got cancer.

It's just a money making exercise for the vaccine makers."
12055,"HPV does have complications in males such as penile cancer, condyloma, and warts. These are rare complications but do indicate and have been approved for immunization in the US and the UK. Due to the rarity of the complications, the cost-effectiveness does not allow for recommendation. The efficacy of the vaccine is higher for homosexual males but it's a doctor call at this point."
12056,"Right, but since it's effective against that (and it explicitly mentions that it works for men as well), why not widen the scope?"
12057,I'm guessing it probably kills 99% of the problem if they do it to just girls. What they seem to be talking about is replacing an existing vaccination with one that also covers genital warts. If you look at the patterns and spread of diseases and then see how vaccination affects it you don't need total cover from vaccination to have an incredible effect.
12058,I think that fact that his name is 'imdavidicke' suggests he's a novelty account of some sort who goes around spewing out conspiracy theories. 
12059,"people love downvoting me as i don't have the hivemind

anyway as regards your point:

why immunise children against genital warts? surely they are underage? obviously underage people have sex but why pump drugs into young children? It is not a killer virus and can be treated pretty simply. Why not use education to stop the spread? Sexually transmitted infections have been around for ever this will not solve the problem. It is either a cost cutting exercise for the NHS or there is ulterior motives. Bird flu jab turned out to be bollocks.

I disagree with the constant injection of children with pharma drugs or vaccines from an early age. They are now giving anti depression drugs to children it has to stop. A child's body is very delicate at early age and should be protected not only against illness but pharma drugs.

If I were a parent and i got the letter saying this should be done for my girl, simple answer no thank you. Now hivemind downvote me for being against the state opinion."
12060,"A very quick look at [wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV-positive_oropharyngeal_cancer#Epidemiology) shows 3.2 (and growing) cases per 100K males in the U.S. for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, and [Cancer Research UK](http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/cervix/) shows approx 4.71 / 100,000 for cervical cancer. Not a massive difference in the numbers.

Gardasil immunises against HPV type 16, so should be effective."
12061,"Yes, that's kind of what I figured.  Thanks for stating it much more clearly than I could (I blame the turkey coma today!).  I wasn't trying to imply that men didn't have any complications from HPV, but that they were much less common, and therefore less cost-effective.  I personally think they should also be recommended for men, even if they had NO potential complications.  "
12062,"penile cancer is not a phrase you hear very often, interesting, i'll have to have a scout."
12063,"As has been said already by someone else, maybe it's a cost issue?"
12064,This is known as [herd immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity).
12065,"Yeah I think a combined vaccination makes the most sense to explain the reasoning, other than someone clutching a purse!"
12066,">It is not a killer virus

[Almost all cervical and most anal cancers are caused by HPV](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/HPV)."
12067,"The underage issue is irrelevant as underage children do have sex. That's an absolute fact.

Education should come as part of it, for sure. But is it enough? There can be health complications of HPV, including cervical cancer so there is a genuine health concern.

As for your opinion that STIs have been around forever... sure, they have. And they likely will be unless vaccination is massively widespread. But that doesn't matter for people that are vaccination.

Vaccines are a far cry from antidepressants, which is incidentally a point that I agree with you on. However, you seem to be thinking that all pharmaceuticals are inherently bad because they come from the big evil pharma industry. Yes, the pharma industry has a *lot* to answer for, but that doesn't mean they offer nothing of value to society.

Gardasil seems to have no significant risks to a human being's health, unlike things like Prozac or other types of antidepressants. The most serious adverse health effect is syncope (fainting) in the minutes following the innoculation.

You are letting your opinion of both the pharma industry and some of its less-safe drugs effect your opinion of a move that has few downsides and actually protects humans from some quite serious potential health issues."
12068,"> I blame the turkey coma today!   

He's American *get him!* "
12069,"It makes perfect sense, there becomes greater protection against the virus but you save a ton of money that can be put to more urgent uses. They would have mountains of data to prove this."
12070,that is cancer not infection
12071,"education is enough, you learn through your mistakes in life

you say some good stuff but fail to note the word children

pharma do produce drugs that save life, agreed on, but they are big corporate companies looking for a profit and like with bird flu like to pump drugs into people in order to cause more problems later on in life, thus creating an opportunity to sell more drugs and make more money

"
12072,"Yes, *she's* American.  I'm sorry. :("
12073,I don't see the relevance of 'children'. The pharmacology isn't significantly different in things like vaccines.
12074,Circumcision. 
12075,The fact that a man has NO right to choose one way or the other when it comes to a fetus he contributed to creating.
12076,"Well I guess the woman should have final say but I would hope the guy has some impact over the decision. I mean, sure, for the first nine months it's pretty much totally the woman's issue, but for the rest of their lives it's the man's child (or emotional baggage if the fetus is aborted) just as much as the woman's. "
12077,"Unfortunately, there are two people, so if she has final say she has all say.  There is no perfect solution; possibly allowing for the contractual dissolution of parental rights prior to 23 weeks by either parent could be more fair, then she has 2 weeks to decide whether to abort, or 4 months to find adoptive parents."
12078,That's not a bad idea (at east I don't think it is). I wrote what I wrote because I just kind of assumed you were saying that if a guy tries to impact the decision he's doing something wrong. Reading it back I'm realizing that might not have been what you were saying.
12079,"Here is the breakdown of the various cancer cases caused (or influenced) by HPV, from the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm):

Cervical cancer: About 12,000 women in the U.S. get cervical cancer each year.

Other cancers that can be caused by HPV, including some vaginal, vulvar, penile, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers: Each year in the U.S., HPV is thought to cause an estimated

    2,100 vulvar cancers,
    500 vaginal cancers,
    600 penile cancers,
    2,800 anal cancers in women,
    1,500 anal cancers in men,
    1,700 oropharyngeal cancers in women,* and
    6,700 oropharyngeal cancers in men.*

It is clear that HPV is a greater risk to women, but not so much that it warrants leaving men completely unprotected."
12080,"I think the original reason is the argument that it generally affects women much more significantly than men (causing cancers in the uterus I believe), and it can be eliminated by inoculating only half the population (because if half of the population is inoculated, then eventually the other half won't be able to catch it).

It isn't the most rigorous of arguments, but I don't think it was intended to be sexist - just economical."
12081,Another point is that the vaccine is equally helpful regardless of which sex gets it as it is a sexually transmitted disease.
12082,"I'm not sure where you live, but where I am, it isn't given to boys because it hasn't been sufficiently tested for  effectiveness for boys."
12083,"The HPV shot used to be just for women, but it is used for men as well. It is strange how they don't seem to care about us and our risk of getting the virus."
12084,"It its for a reason but a very stupid one.

Women are the only ones that get sick after getting the infection.

Why is it stupid then? Herd immunity and evolution."
12085,"I think because HPV mainly gives women cervical cancer, but apparently there are a few strains that can cause cancer in the penis, anus and back of the throat for men. So they're just being sexist by not offering it up for both genders."

12088,"Victorian Schools (Maybe Australian) are now giving the same HPV shots at Years 7 & 9. I got mine done at 95% Reimbursement (ends up being about $60 our of pocket in total). I'm the only one of my male friends to have done so.

Interesting point, my female friends remember them as being the worst needles they ever had, but for me the Tetanus boosters were much worse. I'm happy I got them. I don't know what the future holds, so any attempt to stop something is good."
12089,I think it's just as important for men to be able to get vaccinated for free because as far as I know there is no known test for HPV for men. This could help it being passed on without them being aware.
12090,"It's because we know all women are sluts and need HPV vaccine more than men.

12091,It can actually affect females. Males can only carry it.
12092,"Maybe before you complain about not getting a free vaccination, why not find out what's in the needle first. "
12093,"Who cares about needles?

I don't.

I don't want to be pumped full of drugs.

Fuckthepolice"
12094,"Men are vectors by which women get infected.  This policy is not only sexist, it is stupid even under the assumption that men's experience is of zero value in considering outcomes."
12095,"This is what I don't understand, do the people who are doing this know nothing of [Herd Immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity)? The crazy thing is that this policy isn't only sexist, it's idiotic."
12096,"Cost effectiveness and hypergamy.

It's only really necessary to immunize one gender to arrest HPV in the wild, since male homosexuality only occurs in a small percentage of the population.  The average woman has more access to sex then the average man (remember your 80-20 rule) so immunizing the women addresses the problem more effectively then immunizing men, many of whom simply aren't getting all that much sex in the first place, and with fewer partners.

The CDC is pragmatic.  They don't have to LIKE the 80-20 rule, but they do acknowledge it and plan around it."
12097,Depends on how long that information has been known. New information tends to take about 20 years to become relevant enough to make a *positive* change in politics.
12098,There is a test for men.
12099,"I wasn't complaining,I was asking a question.So maybe next time you try to make a smart remark,why not read the question first?"
12100,"Yeah, 'cause a vaccine is *drugs*."
12101,"I'd actually like to see an analysis of required vaccination rates for sexually transmitted diseases.  For things like the Flu, the CDC has comprehensive breakdowns.  I'm oversimplifying, but it's something like 80% of people need to be vaccinated to prevent serious outbreaks.  STDs may be lower, but probably not lower than 50%.

Edit: credit to /u/Homericus for finding the [term on the tip of my tongue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity)"
12102,"Also, HPV protection is widely cited as an excuse for circumcision (for example, that's what got Brian Morris into circumcision advocacy), so vaccination is obviously worthwhile for anyone who thinks circumcision is."
12103,"If you ignore bisexuality (which people tend to do), the vaccinated gender is obviously protected, but so are people who only have sex with them because you've made sure that there isn't anyone to catch it from, which only leaves the (in this case) gay male population."
12104,Hypergamy?  What does that have to with this?
12105,I think the other issue is that it is virtually undetectable in men. The benefit to women would be getting herd immunity. You would have to innoculate the alpha males who benefit from the cock carousel. It would be... a hard sell.
12106,"It'll make a change tomorrow if men are more likely to infect women with HPV if they didn't get a shot, even when the woman did."
12107,Is there? Google tells me the contrary.
12108,"For a variety of reasons in our current social and legal environment, it increases a woman's overall lifetime sex partner count, and skews her partner's average partner count higher too.

Which increases transmission likelihood."
12109,Probably.
12110,My husband tested positive for hpv.
12111,How is that hypergamy?  Hypergamy is all about marrying up the social and economic ladder.  You may have a better argument with privilege than hypergamy.
12112,Was there visible signs of warts? I think that may be the only way to confirm?
12113,There was and the doctors weren't sure if that is what he had. They tested him and it was positive that he had hpv.
12114,"Do they even offer it for males? 

Men are the carriers of the HPV virus, but it doesn't affect them. I know there isn't a way of testing men as to see if they are a carrier or not. I asked my doctor if there was a test, since I had sex with an ex that had HPV. "
12115,"OK, in general, regardless of your current sexual activity, realize that Gardasil is one of the best vaccines out there. For men, it has been shown to be effective in preventing contraction of genital warts and anal cancer. Not to mention that vaccinating men should help prevent the spread of cervical cancer-causing strains among women. (I know you guys have mothers and sisters). The younger you get it, the more likely that you haven't already contracted the strains it protects against. I hope it becomes a standard vaccination for all young people regardless of sex. It is theoretically effective at any age if you don't already carry the strains it protects against. All that being said, without knowing what strain your partner has, you can't know whether Gardasil is formulated to protect against it. There are many HPV strains that can cause genital warts, and Gardasil does not protect against all of them. HPV is a life-long, incurable infection. It is not 100% preventable with condom use. It can theoretically be contracted/transmitted during oral sex, though the transmission rate may be lower. All viral sexually transmitted infections are incurable (HIV, HPV, HSV, hepatitis). The safe choice is to abstain from sex with partners who have sexually transmitted diseases, especially viral diseases. I emphatically vote ""move on"" unless you plan on having sex with only this woman for the rest of your life, but get Gardasil anyway if you can afford it. "
12116,"""[Gardasil] protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause 90% of genital warts.""

The age is 9-26 it should still be effective.
"
12117,"If you've had unprotected sex with three people before, you're wasting your time as you've likely already got it.

That's why it is aimed at 12 year olds. 

You need to get it BEFORE any exposure."
12118,Holy shit move on.
12119,"I was looking online and some sites said males can get the shot. It is popular among the homosexual and bisexual community. But my questions are, will it prevent me from getting HPV at all?"
12120,It was approved for use on males in the US and UK.
12121,"Not if it was three virgins. Or three people who only have protected sex. There are dozens of strains of HPV. Some are totally benign as far as we know so far. Even if you're already carrying a dozen strains, the vaccine could protect against any it covers that you don't already have. Yes, coordinated large-scale public health efforts do and should target an age before sexual activity. But if you're thinking about helping one person, if there's any chance that you don't already carry at least one strain that Gardasil protects against, I think it's worth getting vaccinated given the high cost of contracting a strain that leads to genital warts or cervical cancer in one of your partners later in life. "
12122,"Well, I don't know if it will prevent you from being a carrier. However, if you have had unprotected sex with anyone who had HPV, there is no way to actually test men to see if they are carriers. You could be one, but not know it. The shot would then be pointless, since it is a vaccination. "
12123,"Hmmm. Didn't know that. I would assume it would be best given prior to sexual interaction, which is the same reason why they push girls as young as 12 to have it. Since the guys really can't be tested, I figure the sooner the better. I'm almost 30, had a girlfriend who had HPV, so I'm probably a carrier. It's not worth it for me to take it, since I probably am a carrier, but will never know it unless they come up with a way to test me. I will gladly take the test if available."
12124,"Hell yes!

""Vaccine. 2010 Oct 4;28(42):6858-67. 

**Impact of vaccinating boys and men against HPV in the United States.**

Elbasha EH1, Dasbach EJ.
 
We assessed the public health impact and value of vaccinating boys and men with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the United States. We used mathematical population models, accounting for both the direct and indirect protective effects of vaccination. Inputs for the models were obtained from public data sources, published literature, and analyses of clinical trial data. Compared with a program of vaccinating girls and women only, including boys and men 9-26 years of age would further decrease the cumulative mean number of genital wart cases, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 cases, cancer cases, and cancer deaths by 5,146,000, 708,000, 116,000, and 40,000, respectively, within 100 years. The mean cost-effectiveness ratio (2008 US $) of this strategy was $25,700 (range: 13,600-48,800) per QALY gained if vaccination protects against all HPV 6/11/16/18-associated diseases, and $69,000 (range: 37,700-152,300)/QALY if it only protects against diseases currently in the vaccine indication. 

**Vaccinating boys and men age 9-26 against all HPV 6/11/16/18-associated diseases provides substantial public health benefits and is cost-effective at commonly cited thresholds.**"""
12125,"It's just a vaccine, it won't hurt you.

It protects against strains of HPV that most commonly cause cervical cancer in women, hence the marketing.  A lot of that also seems to be an attempt to circumvent the puritans worry that an HPV vaccine will increase promiscuity in teens, even though it's been proven it doesn't.

It probably won't do anything for you, but it could save you from giving a cancer causing strain to a partner."
12126,"Shit re-read  your original question.

There's no DOWNSIDE to vaccination over 26 but if it's a sexually active male it may simply be too late.

12127,"Men get HPV related cancers too...penile, rectal, head and neck...I advocate it for boys and girls.  And get them young, BEFORE they're exposed to this fucking cancer causing piece of shit virus! 😀"
12128,"Thanks Dr. Steve! I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions. Can you elaborate on what you mean by diminishing returns? I had read through the FAQ, but it wasn't apparent to me what you might have been referring to. Do you mean that it might not vaccinate me from HPV if I don't already have it?  

I've only been sexually active with my girlfriend since I was 20(she's gotten the HPV vaccine) and have had intercourse with only a few other girls prior to then when I was 18-20, and oral sex when I was in high school. 

My insurance will cover it according to the CVS website when I chose myself and the Gardasil($0 copay), and from what I have read other places it is really only the cost of a new Playstation($300-400) if they didn't.

From different message boards(nothing official) it seemed like most Doctors wouldn't prescribe it because it is going against what is recommended on the box, and/or they assume an adult already has HPV in some form. 


EDIT: Also, what are your thoughts on Gardasil 9 vs the original?
Thanks so much again for taking the time to give me your thoughts on these!!
"
12129,"Diminishing returns in that the longer one waits, the more likely one is to be already infected, therefore the less likely one is to benefit."

12131,">It can also protect against HPV types 16 and 18 which, when sexually transmitted to women, can cause cervical cancer.

I think the driving force here is to prevent cancer in women.  If it doesn't harm women somehow it's not really an issue."
12132,At least there's a vaccine for one of them.

12134,Yeah but its hard having all 3.
12135,"A few years ago I was diagnosed with pre-cancerous cells on my cervix. They had to remove part of my cervix to rid my chances of developing cervical cancer, one of the major issues discussed on the topic of HPV. 

Now although they are not certain, they are almost certain that the cause of my precancerous cells was from past exposure to HPV and it now showing itself. Like others said it is generally asymptomatic. However you can definitely transfer it to someone else without ever knowing it.

People used to say good grief to the idea of teens getting vaccinated but hey, Im 27 now and its too late for me to get vaccinated. 

Its important, and I hope more people realize it could do a world of good preventing any future diseases or cancers. "
12136,Americaaa!!! **AMERICAAA!!**
12137,HPV is everywhere nowadays. Which is why my penis hides inside my body.
12138,"Vaccines are also prohibitively expensive.

Insurance companies don't always pay for them like they did 20 and 30 years ago. "
12139,"You can get an HPV vaccine as a male if you think there's any kind of chance you don't already have HPV. The reason it's generally only offered to males under 25 (I think that's the recommended cutoff) is that if you don't have the vaccine by then, you probably already have HPV. It's generally asymptomatic though, and considered more dangerous for the receiving partner. Young men who have a chance of not already having HPV should get the vaccine if they participate in activities where they are receiving and/or to protect their partners. "
12140,"Yes, clearly having a slightly higher risk for cancer means you should miss out on all the joys that come with a full sex life:)
"
12141,Like that's the reason.

12143,"I believe there's also some evidence having or being vaccinated against one strain makes acquiring another strain less likely.

"
12144,"For every heterosexual sexual interaction there is both a male and a female involved. 

Now gangbangs, That's a different story. "
12145,"If you look a graph theory, and some of the things that computer science knows about networks, you discover something surprising. 

If a majority of females are chaste or highly selective, this promotes the spread of disease. This is because the fewer females who are more promiscuous become ""hubs"" which connect the male population with fewer degrees of separation, and you end up with less path depth than a uniformly connected graph. "
12146,"I think that was more about the cultural implications; people aren't concerned if boys are protected from HPV because men are expected to have sex and that's ok, but god forbid you should help girls get birth control or HPV vaccination and possibly clear a path for them to ruin their virginities!  It's definitely a sexism issue, but not quite in the way you're thinking."
12147,"I viewed it a different way. Many parents are unwilling to vaccinate their daughters because their daughters simply WILL NOT get into a situation where she could be exposed in any way to HPV. But, many parents will also have a ""boys will be boys"" attitude and not think hell would freeze over if their teenage boy had any sexual contact. "
12148,[deleted]
12149,"Pretty stupid reasoning. Who are all these dudes boning if the majority of girls are chaste? More likely is its that the boys are boasting about it whereas the girls keep quieter - the old good key, bad lock joke"
12150,"As stated by a MALE,""There's been a surprisingly muted reaction,"" says Dr. Don Dizon, a Brown University oncologist. ""We tend to believe that girls are chaste and are going to 'save themselves for marriage.' But, you know, sexual activity is something that's almost expected of boys.""
Exactly. Because boys who ""do it"" are crowned as princes, and girls who do it are whores and trash. So girls are forced to lie and play the virgin game. This one isn't really a good argument for men's rights. "
12151,"You're right. I was coming here to comment about something similar.

12152,[deleted]
12153,"Very curious about this, what are the complications associated with the HPV vaccine for boys. Do you have a link?"
12154,"Indeed, the HPV vaccine is more dangerous than helpful.

>Merck used bad methodology in its pre-licensure safety studies that did NOT contain a true placebo. In reporting systemic adverse reactions to the vaccine, instead of using a true placebo that is not reactive on its own, Merck used a vaccine component (aluminum) in what they called the ""placebo.""

>Aluminum can cause inflammation in the body and can make your blood brain barrier more permeable, allowing toxins to pass into your brain and cause damage. It is definitely not appropriate to use an aluminum-containing ""placebo"" to measure the reactivity of an experimental vaccine like Gardasil that will be given to children.

>Researchers did use a saline placebo in one clinical trial, but only reported it in reference to injection site reactions. In those comparisons, the saline placebo had significantly fewer reactions than either the vaccine or the aluminum-containing placebo.

>When it came to reporting the actual adverse, systemic events with the vaccine, Merck combined the aluminum and saline placebos, thus making the ""placebo"" results nearly the same as the vaccine's – and impossible to objectively judge true safety comparisons.

>This encouraged the perception that the vaccine is ""safe"" because the adverse events associated with it were nearly the same as the aluminum containing "" placebo.""

12159,"I agree with you and I wish your comments were not downvoted. HPV is not a serious risk. Most people clear it from their symptoms, death from HPV cancers is VERY low, and there is not enough data on the long term side effects. I hope more people keep an open mind and educate themselves."
12160,"Those deaths aren't necessarily even linked to the vaccine.  They merely say that people who got the vaccine died, and don't list a cause.  In that case, rick127's comment seems to hold about the same amount of water as Jenny McCarthy's views on autism."
12161,"The truth is that a very few slutty males spread disease, while a great deal of slutty women do.  Women also are more susceptible to STDs.  It is women who are most responsible for spreading disease."
12162,"Seriously?  Mercola?  The 'HIV is harmless and AIDS is a psychological condition brought on by stress' guy?  A real doctor?  You're just trolling now, aren't you?

"
12163,"The truth is a lot of men are carriers to disease which may show no outward symptoms (like HPV), thus they believe they are ""clean"" but actually infectious."
12164,"I don't know how the author drew the conclusion in the headline from the views stated by the doctor he interviewed.  The vaccine was designed and tested on girls.  It was aimed towards helping women, who suffer larger problems from HPV.  Girls are encouraged to get the vaccine.  Including boys in the equation? Not worth the money.

And yet, somehow this is translated into selfishness on men's part??  I think the message is clear - the boys are inconsequential in this equation.

It takes some heavily tinted glasses to twist that around into the title remark.  I'd like to know what world he grew up in where boys don't have to do anything."
12165,">""or think about other people in general""

That line made me assume this article had a female author. It didn't."
12166,"Uh, I cook, wash dishes, do laundry and buy birth control in my relationship, as well as be the primary earner. My girlfriend contributes to the relationship as well, and I am happy. But I wanted to note that this person is clearly retarded."
12167,"I always wonder about American doctors and their motivation. We know that penile cancer, an admittedly rare cancer, is caused by HPV. Doctors don't want to vaccinate boys against HPV/penile cancer because it isn't cost effective, but they'll push circumcision to prevent penile cancer. Circumcision, a surgical procedure, is far more expensive in both money and side effects.

Of course, giving a shot doesn't make a doctor much money at all, but circumcision is the gift that keeps on giving. First the doctor fucks it up. Then another doc does a ""correction"". Then the kid gets an adhesion which is ""corrected"". Repeat. Then the kid gets meatal stenosis, which is ""corrected"".

I wonder if the analysis would be different in a civilized country where medicine isn't a profit business. It'll be interesting to see what they do in Europe."
12168,">Why vaccinate girls but not boys? The authors cite several factors. First, HPV is more likely to harm girls. Second, the vaccine is more effective in girls. Third, the rate of viral transmission depends on the virus's prevalence ""in the opposite sex at any given time."" If girls are routinely vaccinated, there's nothing for boys to catch or transmit.

>In other words, boys don't have to get vaccinated for the same reason they don't have to wash dishes, do laundry, buy birth control, or think about other people in general: Girls will do it for them.

Yes, let's focus on the reason that was given for doing it in only one sex, and cry sexism, while **blatantly ignoring the two reasons actually given** for specifically doing it in girls rather than in boys."
12169,"I saw a link on reddit/sex that I cannot seem to find. It was a study pointing to the rise in anal and throat cancers in men caused by HPV. I would love to be vaccinated, just to avoid being a carrier. It's really odd how we don't have funding for HPV vaccine or a male pill. The woman have to do it because we can't. My doctor wont give me the jab even if I paid for it. "
12170,"So I read the article, and I get to this part:

> Why vaccinate girls but not boys? The authors cite several factors. First, HPV is more likely to harm girls. Second, the vaccine is more effective in girls. Third, the rate of viral transmission depends on the virus's prevalence ""in the opposite sex at any given time."" If girls are routinely vaccinated, there's nothing for boys to catch or transmit.

Makes sense to me.  Now this is literally the next sentence:

> In other words, boys don't have to get vaccinated for the same reason they don't have to wash dishes, do laundry, buy birth control, or think about other people in general: Girls will do it for them.

How the fuck do you connect those dots?  I KNOW!  You're a fucking misandrist, that's how!

Also, i can imagine what the author would have written if it was just a vaccine for boys.  ""Boys are protected while girls are left to die.""

"
12171,When the early data came out on the HPV vaccine I think it said it rarely worked on the male test subjects. I don't even know if a doctor would let a male get the vaccine.
12172,"I am all in for vacciinating boys...guess what apparently male health isn´t cost effective enough, there is the hatred he was searching for."
12173,"If only boys were vaccinated, they'd be bitching that women are the primary sufferers and that it's more effective in females:  To cure primarily males is sexist and privileged.

You can never win against the ""Women always win"" mindset."
12174,"What a stupid piece!  First and foremost, it is impossible to test for HPV in men-- so even if a guy wanted to get the vaccine, he might already have the virus and the vaccine might be a useless expense and unnecessary exposure.

Second, the responsiblity of getting this *particular* vaccine *should* be on the girls.  It is women who suffer most of the problems that come to getting HPV-- uterine cancer, ovarian tumors and internal genital warts.
"
12175,"It's nice to know that single men eat off of dirty dishes, have unwashed clothes, don't use condoms, and are all about themselves:  All because they don't have a woman in their life to do it."

12181,"That saddened me.  I wouldn't blame him fully though.  He was probably raised with this mindset.  Any man that is a good man is despite his gender.  He sees every man in his life who is good and kind as an exception, even when it may be the majority of them.  Because no matter how many he comes in contact with, they can't make up for the billions of evil males that everyone tells him are just beyond his vision."
12182,"Or even Canada. Male circumcision is far from a given here, you know."

12189,"Did you read the article?

The reason we don't vaccinate both sexes is because it costs twice as much and is only negligibly more effective.  That is, it's not cost effective to do so.

The same money that was spent on redundant vaccinations could be spent on other health costs that would save more lives per dollar."
12190,"In England, and I think in the US; I guess it's sexist to give only girls the shot.  Pretty soon they will be demanding that males equally get breast cancer:

12195,As it is not all women get the vaccine so inoculating boys would be a good thing because it would protect those women w/o access to the vaccine. Also while HPV does not cause cancer in men like it does women I think that if most men had the option to get a simple shot to prevent genital warts they would take it.
12196,I'm not following your logic at all. How does HPV vaccination lead to disease and cancer?

I am not going to do any more research for you, you are not paying me.  Do your own.  I did mine, I did not save it because I did not think I would need it.  If you chose to get the shot, or give it to you kids, that is your choice."
12204,You are claiming the vaccine leads to disease and cancer. You haven't done research if you came to that conclusion. Saying to look at alternative health is like saying make up random stuff and believe it.
12205,"No, I am claiming that vaccine MAY lead to autism and diseases later in life.  There is enough info on the Web to validate my hypothesis.  Better than I have come to the same conclusion  There is plenty of info backed by scientific data if you only look, including AlternativeHealth sub reddit.  "
12206,">No, I am claiming that vaccine MAY lead to autism and diseases later in life. There is enough info on the Web to validate my hypothesis.

People with no reason to say it saying it is not evidence. The only science to lead to your conclusion is pseudo-science."
12207,OK.
12208,Been meaning to. Why are you against it?
12209,"Sure. HPV also causes head and neck cancers, it's not just about cervical cancer. The proportion of HNC that is caused by HPV infection has exploded over the last 20 years. "
12210,"Yes, drug companies are ""pushing it"" because it has a medical purpose."
12211,Absolutely; it can cause just as many problems in boys as it can in girls. Why would you be against that?
12212,"I feel like its unethical to vaccinate males. The primary argument is that the vaccine will prevent cervical cancers. Males don't have a cervix. The secondary argument is that it will protect females, this is quite possible, but the female being vaccinated will protect her just as well. Now we look at the potential for harm to be done by the vaccine and see that even though it is VERY LOW, a few males a year would die as a result. No male lives will be saved or improved (you can still get HPV, just not certain mainly cervical cancer causing strains). This constitutes an unacceptable risk under deontological thinking. Utilitarians might say that it will help society more to sacrifice some men for the lives of some women, but from an INDIVIDUAL perspective one must put oneself (and one's family) first. "
12213,"You don't know anything about HPV do you? It causes more than cervical cancer. It can give you a glorious set of warts, which look especially spectacular on those men that engage in anal sex with other men-think brown cauliflower. Of course even if you avoid that you can get urethral warts (even if you only have sex with women) which can be rather uncomfortable to say the least.

Finally I question your sense of ethics, surely it is right and proper for men to take steps to avoid giving their sexual partners what is a sexually transmitted disease that can kill them. Is it unethical for an HIV positive man to use condoms? He's already got HIV, not doing him any good. From any perspective of ethics, utilitarian, virtue based, even Kantian ethics (basically name it) it is ethically right. (FYI individual perspective is not an ethical model)"
12214,"It also can help prevent penile and anal cancers, throat and mouth cancers, genital warts, and other diseases that affect men just as much as women.  

&#3232;\_&#3232;
"
12215,"You do realize that there are many many many strains of HPV and that this vaccine only protects against a few. EVEN WITH THE VACCINE you can still get cancers or warts.

Your scenario has a flaw. The HIV positive man using a condom incurs no harm upon himself by doing so. This is in stark contrast to the certain DEATH of at least a few men/boys if everyone is HPV vaccinated. "
12216,And what is the PRIMARY purpose of the HPV vaccine if you know so much? What studies were conducted to prove the HPV vaccines effectiveness? What types of HPV does it protect against? KEEP IN MIND that the companies website is aggressively trying to sell this to you. 
12217,"There are two vaccines available (in the UK anyway) while Cervarix (which is cheaper and hence sadly the more popular one) only protects against 16 and 18 which are cancer causing, Gardasil protects against several more including 6 and 11 which cause the overwhelming majority of genital warts.

As for the ""certain death of the men"" while there are an exceedingly small number of cases of deaths linked to the vaccine they pale in comparison to the number of deaths caused by cervical cancer which number in the thousands. Ethically such a measure only makes sense. the point of the condom was that some people dislike using them for sex and under your argument-[that using it serves no benefit to him] he should not feel obliged to do so. That is an indefensible position."
12218,"You clearly have no understanding of Deontology. Deontology isn't only based upon benefit... its a benefit/harm balance. I'll say it again so you might understand it this time, THE HIV POSITIVE MAN SUFFERS NO HARM FROM USING A CONDOM. HE SAVES SOMEONE ELSE FROM HARM BY DOING SO. THIS IS ETHICAL UNDER DEONTOLOGICAL THINKING. 

But how many men will be saved from cervical cancer? The answer is 0. Thus why not simply vaccinate all the women? Same result as per cervical cancers, but HALF THE MONEY! Its all about money my friend."
12219,"This may surprise you (in fact it definitely will) men can get cancer from HPV. 

>""[types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)""](http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-and-men.htm) 

that's a quote from the CDC, so even under Deonatology, it is ethically justified. The further reason for vaccinating everyone is that it produces something called herd immunity-this is basically the idea that you vaccinate enough people and even if a) it doesn't work in everyone or b) not everyone gets it for whatever reason, you still protect everyone as a result as not enough carriers exist to circulate the virus. "
12220,"ethics is a subjective field by nature, different people/organizations can easily come to different conclusions using the EXACT same methodology. We all have different values. If this 'herd immunity' and the benefits of HPV vaccination are so great WHY DOESN'T THE CDC MANDATE IT? They can't even mandate it for Girls LET ALONE MEN on the basis of the validity of the arguments I have just presented to you. Not a single state currently has the HPV vaccine mandated for anyone, TEXAS REPEALED ITS MANDATE in the face of overwhelming issues regarding how to present the vaccine to the children and how to explain that this by no means totally protects you from getting HPV let alone other STDs."
12221,"Mandating anything vaccine related is fraught with controversy, especially in America thanks to Andrew Wakefield's methodologically and ethically flawed study. So the short answer is that there are no doubt political and financial pressures at work. Why it is though I do not know. In the UK it is strongly recommended and provided free of charge to girls (although only for the cheaper version, there is talk of getting Guardasil approved but no word yet).

Medically and ethically it only makes sense but then again so do a lot of things that do not happen. Why this is the case I can only speculate."
12222,Well if there is one thing that is absolutely certain in this case the lack of mandation is not due to the lack of money. Merck has been THROWING money at advertising and lobbying for years now.
12223,"Look, all that I can provide is the evidence which unequivocally shows two things; 

1) HPV causes cervical cancer in women and various other cancers in both men and women as well as genital warts

2) There are vaccines available that are effective at preventing the contraction of the virus that protect against these rather unpleasant consequences. 

The reason why your state does not support its use is something I cannot explain as the evidence is quite conclusive."
12224,"Lets use the Flu as an analog.

The flu will kill tens of thousands of people this year.
There is a vaccine for common strains.
It is optional. (but recommended)

These 3 factors make the Flu vaccine very very similar to the HPV vaccine with the exception of gender differential.

Would you mandate flu vaccines? "
12225,"I would not ""mandate"" anything (assuming by mandate you mean make compulsary) but again with the flu vaccine it is provided free to those judged to be at risk (in the UK that is) so the elderly and those with chronic lung conditions. I believe that people must have autonomy to make their own decisions and ethically we have no choice but to do so. All that we can do is provide good advice and ensure people understand the consequences of their decisions.

Anyway, are you still against offering the HPV vaccine to men?"
12226,"I'm not against OFFERING anything (offer cyanide pills for all I care). I am totally opposed to mandating it. I would not PERSONALLY get the vaccine or encourage others to get it, but that is a matter of personal choice. I have arguments to support my choice but as in any choice there are two sides. "
12227,"There is no country in the western world where vaccines are ""mandated"". People always have a choice as to whether they are vaccinated or not. (although there are some arguing that MMR should be mandatory this hasn't really gone anywhere) I'm curious as to what your reasons are, is it purely because you are under the impression that people do not have a choice?"
12228,"ok so... they don't tie you down and FORCE you to get the shot, but its pretty damn well mandated when you look at the numbers. More people would rather just get their kids the shots instead of having to deal with the bureaucracy that is the public school system in the US. The child has no choice, but could be greatly harmed. Diminished autonomy 101, the child needs greater protection. Is it REALLY a choice when the school's form has a check box marked 'required'  Sure you CAN get out of the required box, but thats not always stated on the form, the process is ALWAYS more lengthy and has more paperwork involved. If we are truly interested in free choice then this is unethical. "
12229,"Look bru, I'm not going to argue the issues you have with your countries school system. Children definitely need better protection-look at all the idiots that won't let their children get protected against Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) that is truly disgusting. And yet, because we respect autonomy and patient rights they are allowed to do so. All that I can tell you is that the evidence shows that this vaccine protects both boys and girls from a disease that at its best can be quite disfiguring and at its worst can result in a very unpleasant death. Hardly something to be getting bent out of shape about people having. "
12230,"to include the department of health and human services description of these state vaccination requirements ""
In most states, a parent must bring written proof of a child's immunizations from the health provider or clinic at the time of school registration. If a required vaccination has not been obtained, and there is no health condition or religious objection preventing immunization, the child must receive the vaccinations before school entry.""

So you need a 'reason' and ""I don't want it"" isn't good enough. Children are required to attend school (or parents can serve JAIL TIME) This is coercion."
12231,"it all ties together. Anyhow, I'm happy that you can get the HPV vaccine if you want. Go for it. If you want my opinion on the matter (like say if you ASK REDDIT) I'm going to say its not worth it for males. Thats my opinion."
12232,Fair enough. I just hate to see people being misinformed so I was hoping to at least give you the facts.
12233,"No, it's not sexism, it's simply a question of effective use of resources.

First, the potential complications of HPV infection are worse for women than for men.  Not only are the complications much worse, they're much more common.  HPV is simply far more dangerous for women than men.

Second, you don't need to vaccinate both men and women anyway.  Vaccinating either gender will result in a subsequent drop of infection in the other gender, as transmission decreases.  In other words, less women with HPV infections mean less transmission of HPV from women to men.  Cut off transmission in either direction and it reduces cases for both genders (with the notable exception of homosexual men, who should also be vaccinated).

Since the virus is much more dangerous for women, and reducing infection in either gender will create a corresponding drop in rates of the other gender, the logical choice is to vaccinate women.  We can do it for half the price of vaccinating everyone because we're not ""wasting"" vaccines on men who are going to get the benefits of reduced transmission from women anyway and have a very low risk of serious complications.

This is the ""public good"" portion at least.  If a man wants to get vaccinated, he should.  There's no reason for him not to, but the benefits of having the government pay for men to be vaccinated along with women just don't match cost."
12234,"Dude of course it's OK to ignore men, because men oppressed women for so long, right? What our ancestors did is always our fault. It's similar to pulling the slavery card.

(sarcasm)

On the bright side, if you don't like munching box, you can be like ""sorry hon I don't wanna get cancer, and I can't afford screening"" lol"
12235,if course it is socially acceptable to blame men for these kinds of things.  the modern feminist movement now isn't about equality.
12236,"Government makes a lousy god, huh?"
12237,"Truth be known it's a female sterilization/fertility reduction program, the HPV side is just marketing to attract moths to the car head-lights.  This is why men are a low priority; the vaccine won't sterilize them.

**HPV Vaccine and Primary Ovarian Failure**

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23902317"
12238,Got a pesky wart huh?
12239,"ok, so if the genders were reversed, would you be ok with ""effectively using resources"" in a manner that only supplied men with the vaccine?"
12240,"but men are taxpayers, and human beings.
its ok to let people die because its not ""cost effective?' o, you mean its ok to let MEN die because its not cost effective.
don't you see what feminism has done? you're so brainwashed you've been conditioned to accept that the life of a man is valued only be his economic value, whereas women should be saved no matter what cost."
12241,This doesn't address transmission amongst homosexual men. 
12242,"Since when are governments actually concerned with efficient use of resources in advance of any actual spending? Your talking about the least efficient systems in the world. If the concern was an efficient use of resources the plan would likely have never went forward in the first place.

The more likely cause is that feminism is mainstream and considered a legitimate group to lobby for while men's rights advocates are generally considered to be hate groups.

TL:DR It didn't happen because almost no one asked for it."
12243,"This is the answer.

Now if someone will please knock OP off the soapbox . . . "
12244,men have been oppressed in feudal and classist societies for as long as women have
12245,"so, your answer shows the sexism against men in society. you wouldn't respond that way if the genders were reversed and I was talking about sexism against women"
12246,"Sure, this is done in medicine *all the time*.

""Female condoms"" are incredibly effective in preventing the transmission of HIV (it's just what you'd imagine, basically a condom that goes inside the vagina).  However, go to Africa and try to find a non-profit giving women free protection from HIV in the form of female condoms.  You won't (at least not without working hard, I'm sure there's probably one or two out there).

Why?  Several reasons:  female condoms are more expensive to make.  They're harder to teach people how to use.  And the rate of female-to-male transmission is lower than the rate of male to female transmission (an HIV positive male is more likely to transmit it to an HIV negative woman than vice versa).  So by giving men a bunch of free protection and education on how to use it you get more bang for your buck (no pun intended) on reducing infection rates.

It's just logistics. "
12247,"You're incredibly naïve if you think that these decisions aren't made every day.  Again, what we're talking about here is government subsidized vaccinations.  The government can't afford to combat every single health problem all at the same time.  There is only so much money to go around and we have to use it in the most efficient way possible.  

In fact, it would be unethical for the government to do anything else, since money spent inefficiently combating HPV by vaccinating both men and women could be spent on something else, like cancer research or whatever.  The government's job is to use the money they get to the most efficient means possible.  To do otherwise will cost lives elsewhere, in other avenues of research.

Sometimes that means a bias in the benefits from one gender to another.  In this case it's women.  In another case it will be men.  

That's reality.  But like I said, if men are worried about it they should get vaccinated.  There's nothing stopping them.  But the government can spend that money better elsewhere."
12248,"again, so if the genders were reversed, youd be ok with a male only vaccine?

don't you see how you're answer shows the subconscious sexism of men you've been ingrained with growing up in our society?"
12249,Shhhhh!! Don't tell them that! They get angry when you use facts.
12250,"Your imagination is running away. The impacts and consequences of HPV on the genders are far different, hence the difference in remediation of the problem. 

There are plenty of actual instances of gender bias, like much harsher sentencing of men than women for underage sex crimes, that could use some attention."
12251,"you didn't answer the question. stop deflecting.

if a disease affected both men and women and killed both men and women, but was much worse for men, would you support only giving the vaccine to men?"
12252,"Your question is nonsense, that's why. The HPV vaccine is recommended for men in the US and other countries."
12253,"no, its not nonsense, you're just a coward who cant answer because your subconscious misandry cant allow it.

lets say another hypothetical disease. if a disease affected both men and women and killed both men and women, but was much worse for men, would you support only giving the vaccine to men?

12279,"In addition to what has already been said, I just wanted to add:

You may (or may not) know that HPV is strongly associated with cervical cancer in women which is why it's recommended that females get the vaccine.  However, what you likely don't know is that small numbers of males can get penile cancer after they contract HPV, and there's even some talk about males getting the vaccine as well.  See edit.

HPV is a virus (Human papillomavirus) that is not curable once a person gets it.  If you're girlfriend indeed has it, you should get tested even though you've only used condoms.  You likely don't have it, but there's always that chance.

Bottom line: talk to your physician.  Based on your gf's sexual history, if she doesn't end up having HPV then her doctor will likely strongly suggest she get the vaccine.  Your physician may recommend it for you as well.

12280,"HPV is kinda random. Some people have a bunch of breakouts and others never do. Supposedly you can only contract if she's having a breakout and the skin tears and her blood is tranferred to you, but they say the warts can be microscopic so it doesn't help much. That and they could be inside her anyway.

From what I've read it's with you for life... so no cure! If you have a lot of outbreaks they could be painful to you or quite repulsive to any potential future partners.

Since she's your first, AND she's had multiple other partners, it's *sort of* safe to assume you won't be together for ever. I think you should be sure about whether or not she has it before you have sex with her without a condom. Also if she does have it and you still wanna have sex with her, at least be sure she's not having a visible outbreak then.

I really wouldn't advise having condomless sex with her if she has it though... if you give it to your future wife there are even chances of complications for your children."

From wikipedia's article on HPV: 

>'Most HPV infections in young women are temporary and have little long-term significance. Seventy percent of infections are gone in 1 year and ninety percent in 2 years.[6] However, when the infection persists—in 5% to 10% of infected women—there is high risk of developing precancerous lesions of the cervix, which can progress to invasive cervical cancer. This process usually takes 10–15 years, providing many opportunities for detection and treatment of the pre-cancerous lesion. Progression to invasive cancer can be almost always prevented when standard prevention strategies are applied, but the lesions still cause considerable burden necessitating preventive surgeries, which do in many cases involve loss of fertility.'

As a show of camaraderie to your wife, apparently the HPV vaccine also works for guys. Perhaps both of you should consider getting vaccinated, not just her. 

From the wiki article on HPV vaccine:

>'HPV vaccination is approved for use in males in many areas. In addition to protecting their partners from cervical cancer, vaccination can protect males against anal cancer, and may prevent other HPV associated cancers. Gardasil can also protect males against genital warts. HPV vaccination has been recommended for males in the United States, where vaccine uptake among women has been low.'

Finally, keep in mind that:

>Gardasil and Cervarix are preventative vaccines and do not treat HPV infection or cervical cancer.

If she wants you to be fully mono as well, then the choice is really up to you whether giving up a poly lifestyle is a fair price for a continued relationship with her. That's not a question I think we can answer for you, of course.

I personally probably could go functionally mono, but it's not something I'd be willing to do except in a very extreme circumstance. Not because I feel I need to have multiple partners, but because I feel disallowing it would be an unfair restriction of my autonomy."

There's also vaccines available to treat hep B. They require two shots, six months apart. As these are both able to be transmitted during intercourse they qualify as sexually transmitted infections.

Despite its low prevalence in the population, it is a horribly disfiguring cancer to treat, because of the often extensive maxillofacial resections that have to occur - think Roger Ebert, who had this level of resection due the invasion of the bone from his thyroid primary.

12316,"Well...not entirely true. HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers have a very high local control rate (90+%) when treated with chemotherapy and radiation. Unfortunately, as in your friend's case, when it's not successful the results can be very bad, and disfiguring surgeries may be employed. For example, Roger Ebert failed chemoradiation and subsequently had a mandibulectomy as you mention. "
12317,"Your wife can definitely consider Gardasil -- it protects against two wart-causing strains of HPV that together account for 90% of genital warts. So if she has not caught the virus from you already, the vaccine could be protective. (It's approved for anyone from age 9 to 26, so if your wife is older than 26 she can receive the vaccine but would have to pay full price, i.e. insurance companies won't cover it.)

There are ways to test for HPV in males, but none has been approved by the FDA. Testing methods now are used in research but aren't commercially available. It really sucks! Hopefully testing options will increase in the near future.

A really good book to check out is [The HPV Vaccine Controversy] (http://blog.advocatesaz.org/2012/01/25/book-club-the-hpv-vaccine-controversy/), which lays out the facts in a really accessible way. Don't be fooled by the title -- it is more about HPV than the controversy surrounding the vaccine. (I guess the title was an attempt to sell more books?) It is a very helpful resource for anyone who has been diagnosed with HPV and needs their questions answered. And it spends a lot of time on genital warts and HPV in males, which is very valuable as most people tend to talk about HPV in the context of cervical cancer in females."
12318,"You are not alone. HPV is so common and most likely the wart will go away some day. These warts will show their ugly head when your immune system is compromised.  Eat healthy, get some exercise and don't stress out about this very common, usually benign virus.

12319,"Yeah dont stress too much.  Only now are they starting to type HPV infections (as there are around 150 types) an even then they only type them for women with abnormal paps and HPV.  Good news is most people can clear HPV if they are healthy, especially young people.  This definitely means your girl needs regular pap tests, aka once year or more depending on results.  Also consider Gardasil, the HPV vaccine.  Although it only protects against the four most common and most annoying strains (two that cause warts and two than can lead to cancers) there is some evidence of cross protection with other strains.  It's approved for males and females 9-29.  I'm a sexual health nurse in Canada so if you're American, some of this might be different.  But honestly, HPV is way better than having herpes or HIV..."

I really hope that people become more aware of how important the vaccine is.  I once read that 80% of women will have HPV at some point in their life, even if they're never aware of it.  Most times, the body treats itself.  What's really unfortunate is that it can be dormant for years and surface all of a sudden.  So, you can be in a completely monogamous relationship and still contract it.  Also, there's no test for HPV in males.

12335,"There are two different types of vaccines, one that protects against warts AND cervical cancer and one that protects against warts only.  The best time to get the vaccine is before any sexual contact (virgins) as they have yet to be exposed to the virus.

From [immunize.org](http://www.immunize.org/vis/vis-hpv-gardasil.pdf):

> Males: Males 9 through 26 years of age may get HPV vaccine to prevent genital warts.  As with females, it is best to be vaccinated before the first sexual contact.

Since the vaccine was not approved for male use during the time you were still in the age range and you have yet to have your first sexual contact, it *should* be no problem to get the vaccination.  But given it's off label usage (age), PP might not be willing to do it due to liability issues.  There's no way to find out but to call the center.

Also, to address something that you posted in another comment.

> But I am 100% a virgin and not exposed yet, so [age] shouldn't matter.

Whether or not you're a virgin is not really a factor in getting the vaccine.  It is recommended that a person gets the vaccine before their first sexual encounter because once a person has been infected with the virus, the vaccine might not work as well.  It definitely helps in protecting against HPV as you have never been exposed to it before but it's not a determining factor in whether or not a person meets the requirements to get it.  It sounds like they put a restriction age range as opposed to sexual encounters (virgin vs. nonvirgin) as a means of effectiveness."
12336,"This is a nonissue, as there is no HPV vaccine for men.  There is no HPV test for men either."
12337,"Who told you there isn't a test for hpv for males?  Did you hear that from planned parenthood or some feminist organization?  Clinics don't perform routine tests on males but there are ways of testing for it.

12345,"Your old doctor and my old doctor should get coffee together! (In jail) 

When he asked for my sexual history and I marked oral sex, he told me my fiancé (boyfriend at the time who I engaged in oral sex with) was abusing me. 

“You should not let him abuse you like that. Oral sex is abusive and you’ll get a disease from it.” 

According to that dick, I’m marrying my abuser next year! Cheers."
12346,"If it makes you feel any better, my primary care physician up until I turned 18 told me that I would continue to have awful anxiety attacks for the rest of my life unless I started believing in Jesus again.  Some doctors are just awful."
12347,"Can I comment on maybe a lesser part of the story?

Please, for the love of god, report that doctor to the state medical licensing board. He has committed gross violations of ethics and actually endangered your life. People could die if he continues to practice medicine."
12348,Good for you!! I’m still annoyed that I was one year over the age cutoff and couldn’t get it when it came out. I would’ve happily paid retail and everything. Sigh. 
12349,"Not to rain on any parades but you will still need to worry about cervical cancer. I had the vaccine around 16-17, and have still had HPV, multiple ASCUS paps, an AGUS pap, colposcopies, endometrial biopsies, and a LEEP. Please still be vigilant with your annual exams."
12350,"Or like my doctor who told me i had to be a virgin to get the HPV vaccine, and said there was no point in getting it when i asked about it at 14 years old.. guess who got diagnosed with it ten years later :)))) 

Anyways, on topic with your post, yay girl!! You absolutely wont regret it"
12351,"That's fantastic, good for you!  My 12y boy is getting his second shot in a couple of weeks."
12352,I think I saw 1 HPV vaccine commercial in like 2004. I was never told about it again and I went to planned parenthood after every partner. It wasnt until I got a weird result on my papsmear in 2009 that they offered it to me. It was too late. :(
12353,"I'm glad your wiser than your mother. HPV is no joke. I've always practiced safe sex but even still found out at 31 that I had HPV 16, an aggressive strain known for causing cervical cancer, throat cancer and more. Luckily for me my OBGYN caught it in a pap test, decided to look at my cervix under a microscope and low and behold there was a lesion. She removed the spot and sent it to testing where it came back positive for cancer. I had another part of my cervix removed around the same area and had another biopsy. Again lucky for me my OB had already contained the entire lesion in the first biopsy and no more cancer cells appeared. A year later I got a phone call after my next pap to let me know that my body had fended off the virus and I was in the clear. This is not always the case and I know many who are younger than I fighting this virus through surgery after surgery and are slowly losing the ability to have a family. All because one little vaccine wasnt quite yet available to us. I had JUST missed the age range to receive it. Also I might add, had it not been for the state health exchange I would never have been able to afford the health insurance that I do now and would more than likely have a festering cancer that I knew nothing about. Education is key, thank you for thinking clearly and taking control of your health. "
12354,This makes me so sad. Good on you! You could literally get HPV from your husband even if he is your first sexual partner and you never had sex prior to marriage (which is like the most conservative idea of sex I could think of). Or does your doctor believe even sex within marriage is for “bad girls” too? 
12355,Report the doctor to the state ethics board. Should lose his license over that shit. 
12356,"I'm 26 and had no idea I could still get it until my latest gyno asked me. I just had no idea, I'm going next week. Good for you for taking control of your health!"
12357,"My mom didn’t let me get it. Not because she’s antivax, but because of whatever reason in her head... However. I am now 23, and completely forgot that she had ovarian cancer- and that the female-leaning cancers tend to be higher in our family. It worries me now, and I haven’t been able to look into getting the shot because of business in life. I feel your pain, and wish you awesome luck getting these done!!"
12358,"My s.o.'s sister isn't antivax, but she is highly religious. She was FURIOUS when her husband took her son (not his biologically) to the doctor and he got the HPV shot. Now he has to get the last 2 and she's bad-mouthing her husband each time the boy has to go in. She also has 3 daughters, and none of them are getting the shot.

The sad part is that she of all people should know that you can be a ""perfect"" Christian and still not be safe. Her first husband cheated on her, so who knows what she could have contracted from him. "
12359,"My health insurance wouldn’t pay for my hpv vaccine because of my age even though my paps were always good. Now, my paps are positive for the hpv (can’t remember the strain off top of my head) that causes cancer and I’m at the last layer of cervix tissue for abnormal cells and its become urgent to treat. Please, please every woman should get the hpv vaccine. "
12360,That doctor needs to have his medical license yanked.
12361,"My mom didn’t let me get it because she was very conservative Christian. I finally got it at 24 because it’s a good idea for everyone, regardless. I’m in a monogamous relationship and I still got it. It’s never too late and it’s never not necessary. I just hope I haven’t been exposed already prior to getting the vaccine. "
12362,"Good for you!  Frankly your old family doctor sounds irresponsible.

I'm glad you'll be protected."
12363,"My mom said vaccines were the way the government tracked you. On paper, religious exemption. Ps that was bullshit. The moment I turned 18 I went and started catching up on everything. 

Drugs are bad, vaccines are good."
12364,"> My old (male) family doctor told me that only ""bad girls"" need it, and since I'm a ""good girl"" I don't need to get the vaccine. This doctor also used to tell me every checkup from 7-18 that boys will only want me for sex, and that is why I should never have sex.


As a med student, I'm sorry you had this guy as a doctor. This is completely unprofessional. None of my future colleagues should be inserting their opinions and beliefs into their practice *unless* the patient asks for them. 

"
12365,So glad for you! Also your old doctor sounds like a real asshole. 
12366,"I have/had HPV. The 1st sign of abnormal cells my gyno gave my the hpv vax (the 1st time I went to the gyno I was 26, my mom and I just dont talk about that stuff, if I need a tampon she calls it the ""feminine hygiene product"").  I had to go back in, the cells turned cancerous. They preformed the leep and that was terrifying. Last month for the 1st time ever I got a perfectly normal, all negative pap smear. Took 2 years. 0/10 do not recommend cervical cancer."
12367,"Pediatrician and vaccine advocate here.

Thank you for doing this.  Just so you know: it stings for a few seconds.  You might have a sore or swollen arm for a day.  It’s very safe."
12368,Same here! Mom was never really anti vax until this shot came out. Didn’t get it at 15 like the other girls in my class. Almost 10 years later now and I’m going for my first dose! 
12369,I'm always amazed at how anti-science doctors can be sometimes. 
12370,"I have been told it’s too late once we are past 18!  Can adults get this vaccine?  (I’m 35, male, for context).  I already plan on vaccinating my kids (when I have them).  "
12371,"I got it when I was 14, years before any sort of anything happened in that area. However, I still got HPV. It's not 100% I'll still get it for my kids eventually, but it's still something you should continue to be checked for regularly. The vaccine helps prevent you from getting cervical cancer but it's not a guarantee. Please continue to get regular checks. "
12372,"My grandma was diagnosed with cancer for the third time last week, and learned that she and my grampa both have the virus. The cancer showed up in her throat this time, she had to have her tonsils removed and all her teeth pulled. She's the toughest woman I know and barely cried when my mom died or when she broke her arm, but she's been sobbing in pain all week. If cancer is avoidable from a shot, why wouldn't you take it? "
12373,I live in a rural community in a super religious state.  We have an HPV epidemic going on with the teenagers and young adults in the area right now. Many of the parents in the area didn't get their kids the HPV vaccine because like birth control you're just giving your kids permission to have sex.  I'm so glad you are doing this and I know how hard it is to break away from indoctrination that you grew up with.  Good for you!
12374,"Bravo, good on you. This is the sort of post I always love to see. Far too much anti-science stuff goes on so it is nice. Ignore those calling you a shill, if we are all shills I really have to wonder where MY paycheck went. "
12375,Getting a vaccine doesn't make you promiscuous that doesn't make any sense. Who are these people.
12376,"Awesome! So happy for you! My girlfriend didn’t get it as a girl because her mom refused because only sinning girls need it. Well, she had precancerous cells so now we have that to check up on... luckily the cells were scraped and we haven’t seen them come back in the past two years, but still super scary. "
12377,"wow, i didn’t realize until reading these comments how lucky i am to have parents who are not this conservative and who are also fairly sex positive. i vaguely remember getting the vaccine, but i had absolutely no idea what hpv was. my parents treated it as every other vaccine.

good on you, op, for moving past the lies you’ve been told and protecting your health."
12378,"That doctor doesn't deserve his license! What a thing to say...

I'm honestly shocked "
12379,"Also got the shot series as an adult! My parents got me all the other vaccines, but this one never came up until I found out about it in college. My doctor had never mentioned it. "
12380,"Excellent!  I'm glad you are protected now!  That doctor is so painfully ignorant and stupid!

Boys should also get it.

I while ago there was a Reddit post about someone's father getting HPV-related oral cancer and seeing him die.  Guys can get oral and penis cancer from HPV also.

It's a bad virus and everyone should be protected!"
12381,I read the first sentence and really though the next would be about a terrible diagnosis. Thanks for not ruining my day.
12382,[removed]
12383,"My mom isn’t anti-vax, but didn’t believe in it— neither did I; I heard that it hurt, and there were side effects. One week ago I had my second dose. Four months ago I had an abnormal PAP and a diagnosis of high-risk HPV. My only partner before that was a virgin, but it’s possible from things that aren’t PIV as I found out. I knew it had to be from him, which is one of the worst things to tell someone. “You gave me something through no fault of your own, but now we both have this virus that can cause cancer, and we can pass it on unknowingly for at least the next year.” 

I’m 23, so there’s not too much to do right now but sit and wait. And wait and wait and wait. And just get screened for every known cancer related to HPV on time every 6 months, every year, every 3 years, whatever it is. Yes, it is common, but the risk of cancer DRASTICALLY increased with every risk factor, especially high-risk HPV, or multiple strains. If you’re over 21, or sexually active, get your Pap. If you’re under 26, get the vaccine. Even if it gives you 5% protection, that’s 5% less to worry about getting a strain that causes cancer as there are 11?, 13? of them. 

Your parents don’t need to know about the vaccine or anything, but my parents noticed something was up when I had the bandaid on my arm, so I told them. My body, my choice, I’ll pay if there was any cost. Haven’t told my mom about the HPV though because I haven’t accepted it yet (also none of her business unless g-d forbid something happens to me). Stay safe, and good luck OP. "
12384,I lost an aunt to cervical cancer.. good for you!! I had both of my girls vaccinated in middle school as soon as it came out.  It was one more thing I could do to make sure they remained healthy. 
12385,Wait I never got it too (though I don’t think it  as available) I’m 32 is it too late to get it? I have a family history of cervical and ovarian cancer 
12386,"Hey! I'm proud of you for having the guts to take charge and do what you felt was best for YOU. And for the record, it doesn't make you a loose woman. It makes you a woman who cares about protecting her body and her health. 

It's a catch-22. People might think it's ""slutty"" to get the vaccine, but if you don't get it and end up with cervical cancer... they'll probably say the same damn thing. Either way, people are going to have negative shit to say. "
12387,"I got mine when I was 25 and ended when I was 26. It took me a long time to convince myself, since I have a huge phobia of shots and I didnt know how effective the shot actually was. They were painful. [Especially the last one.] but a little pain is worth the lesser chance of getting cancer. Glad you were able to do it. "
12388,"I wish there were a program for kids—high school kids, perhaps 14 and up—to get vaccinated on the government's dime without their parents finding out. Yeah, a lot of these kids come from rich families with great insurance. Beverly Hills is one of the least-vaccinated communities in the USA. But they can't tell their parents. Herd immunity is worth a couple extra pennies in taxes.

Anyway, I'm so glad you got the vaccine! Go read some Anais Nin, she'll help you exorcise the memories of old doctors denigrating sexually active women. I know these people are just trying to help, in their weird, Handsmaid's Tale way, but good freaking grief.
"
12389,"i'm glad for you! my mom did exactly the same to me. I'm still 16 and can't get a vaccine by my own, tho."
12390,You should get all of the vaccines.
12391,Did it feel like a really dense shot? When I got mine it felt like someone was holding a brick and just standing there pressing it against my arm haha
12392,[deleted]
12393,good  for you. we need to stop eradicate diseases not bring them back 
12394,"The GP said 99% of cervical cancer occurrences are due to HPV.... Its worth getting the shots. We had them done at secondary school age here in the UK. I'll take being lazy with smear tests now seeing as if it's 1% chance, something else is far more likely to kill me off than cervical cancer"
12395,"Sounds like you need to get far away from your mother, and replace that doctor"
12396,"I’m getting it soon too! My parents aren’t anti-vax, I got all the normal shots but my mom said I didn’t need the HPV one when it was time.  Because it was decided that I wasn’t going to have sex, apparently (I think it was a mix of that and the fact that she was just uneducated about HPV and the risk for cancer)."
12397,Good for you for taking charge of your own health. 
12398,"I got the shot series at 26 ish when I joined the army. They said do you want the hpv vaccine and I was like Fuck Yes! 

I will never forget the day my college friend screamed across the liberal arts building “That guy likes giving girls STDS!!” Chased him kinda said it several times.  He shrinked and frantically left the common area. Before the outburst she turned to me and said “I had sex with that guy and he gave me genital warts” 

Welcome to college I suppose"
12399,[removed]
12400,"Oops I got it 12-ish years ago and I'm alive. Heh. Wow did your mom and doctor work you over a bit. 

I did get the shots a bit out of series, like I got one of them too early or something, due to nurse's error but they said it should be fine. Hopefully so. My mother didn't get it of course since it didn't exist then. She got HPV (my father cheated a lot) and had pre-cancerous cervical cells removed a few years ago. I worry sometimes.  

Good luck!!! "
12401,I'm 22 and in Australia can I still get this vaccine?
12402,Good! You'll be fine and protecting yourself is wonderful.
12403,You go girl! I’m so happy for you.
12404,Good
12405,"Good for you. 
"
12406,"Congrats!  So glad you’re protecting yourself, and as far as sex goes just be safe and have fun!  :)"
12407,"As a relatively privileged white cishet male, its so scary and frustrating hearing how many women have to deal with medical professionals administering treatments only in line with their personal religious beliefs. I first had a female friend tell me about getting shamed when we were just out of high school. I still hear about friends having to deal with this shit and Im 38 now.

I am so sorry we live in a world where doctors are professionally influenced by personal religious choices. So infuriating and Im damn near bullet proof in my privilege.  "
12408,"Got them as part of a nationwide program and couldn’t be happier, I do remember that it hurt like a bitch though! Welcome to the club."
12409,That doctor should be fired
12410,Parents are fucked man 
12411,Good for you. Thats whats awesome about being alive today. Even when our parents fail us in some ways (who knows maybe she is amazing otherwise) we get to correct that as adults. You deserve to live your life your way :)
12412,"I was an anti-vaxer. My mom got me into it. Showing me all of the “information “ on the chemicals involved and personal testimonies. I also believed the earth was only 6000 yo at the time. My, how I have grown! I have been looking for doctors that will not judge me, but help me vaccinate my kids. Especially now. "
12413,Proud of you!
12414,"Thank for being your own person and making your own decisions.

Thnx to people like you we might one day completely get rid of these diseases."
12415,"Congratulations on a smart decision, and I hope you stay healthy!

But also, this raises the question of why we require parental permission to get the HPV vaccine, once a person is old enough to have sex anyway.  The notion that you are someone else's ""property,"" and that they ""own"" your body, should be more appalling to us than it is.

Very young kids need their parents to restrict them from doing dumb things like playing in traffic.  But there's no rational reason why a teenager needs their parents to ""protect"" them from getting the HPV vaccine, where the benefits overwhelmingly outweigh the risks.  (If there are medical risks in a particular person's situation, the doctor will be overwhelmingly more informed about those risks than either the parent or the patient.)

Any restriction on people's personal liberty needs to meet a very high bar to be justified.  Restrictions on freedom for little kids, and for mentally infirm adults, pass that test.  Telling a teenager she can't get a lifesaving vaccination, because her parents are opposed to it, does not pass that test."
12416,"I just want to say how happy I am that you finalle get to vaccinate yourself. I just got my third shot on Tuesday. I am 26 now so we’re kinda similar there:) my family is just a bit ignorant about women’s health. They consider having a pap smear before marriage is unnecessary. *shrugs* Even the nurse at the clinic sounds skeptical when I said that I want to take birth control after getting married. Where I am, they consider birth control only for women who have given birth. We still have a long way to go to raise awareness about these issues


Been telling my friends to vaccinate themselves too on Instagram. I posted where they can get the vaccine and what number they can call to ask any questions they have. I hope I helped even a few."
12417,"Very cool and very adult. As a father of daughters the ""bad girl"" comment makes me want to slap him. I once had a woman chemist/pharmacy assistant give my daughter crap over picking up her birth control. I then proceeded to verbaly yet politely let her know what i thought of her, her lack of professionalism, and holier than thou attitude. It was good father/daughter bonding. I am sorry your mom or da wasnt in your corner for you. "
12418,"As soon as they started recommending the HPV vaccine for boys as well as for girls, I took my son to his pediatrician and got him vaccinated. It was only a few years ago that Michael Douglas was all over the news, talking about how his throat cancer was caused by HPV. I didn't want that to happen to my son in 30-40 years, nor did I want him infecting a partner later on. "
12419,"It blows my mind that just to enter USA (Student visa) I have to show proof of vaccinations for like 20 different illnesses. But people who live in USA aren't required to do so. 
It's like the American government is actively trying to protect the people who are visiting it from their own population. Lol."
12420,One in 7 billion*
12421,"I am so, so sorry you had a doctor that did not provide you with adequate medical care. I am in medical school now and I can tell you that none of my classmates or professors would pull this crap. I hope you have an excellent physician now with whom you can be open and honest with. Everyone deserves that ."
12422,I am not trying to start an argument but can someone explain to me the difference between the HPV vaccine today and the Gardasil shots I got which I was told years later could very likely cause me to get Cervical cancer? Or was the dr that told me that full of shit? I would like to know because I am raising 3 soon to be 4 girls and if getting the HPV shot is safe and will help them then I of course want whats best for them. 
12423,"Good for you. I sold this vaccine when it came out, and I can’t begin to explain the level of SHIT I caught in some offices for bringing them the information. At the time, my daughter was 13 and as soon I got her Dr. to stock the vaccine, I got it for her. Every time there’s an update to the statistics showing an increased reduction in the rate of cervical cancer, I can’t help but feel a little bit proud. Thanks. "
12424,"This situation is why I'm kind of glad that Australia has made it mandatory to give vaccinations to kids. If you don't have your kids fully immunised you don't get welfare payments, and you can't put them in childcare or public schools (even most private schools adhere to the rule) unless there's a valid medical reason not to immunise which must be documented by two separate doctors. 

People who don't immunise don't deserve kids imo."
12425,"Thank god my grils have a real pediatrician-- a woman who strongly ""suggested"" they get the HPV vaccine in middle school. I know the male doctors in their practice say the same, but the very idea of a licensed medical professional giving such ridiculous (and judgemental) advice is simply appalling.

Parents, if you have a crappy pediatrician shop around! Most communities have more than one doctor/practice and it's worth it for your kids. OP, glad you finally got the medical care you were deserved all along."
12426,"I am so freaking proud of you for doing this! 

When I was a teenager the HPV vaccinations were new (I think). At that time I had no idea what HPV was and that it was so unbelievably common for men to be carriers. My mother didn’t make me go get the shots, she was never really on top of my medical stuff. So, I didn’t bother. 

Now, nearly 30, I’ve had to have multiple colposcopies (extremely painful) and a LEEP procedure. I still live in fear that I’ll have to redo these procedures in the future. Learn from my mistakes! So glad you’re taking your health into your own hands. "
12427,"Both of my children now 16(boy) and 17(girl) both had had all three of their HPV shots. In a conversation with a very religious and conservative friend of mine (not to start a conversation on this) she brought up the fact that it did not matter for her children 21(boy) and 17(girl) because they were both brought up well and neither they or her children’s spouses would have sex until marriage. 

I was also that girl brought up in the Bible thumping belt of the US. I am sure my mom felt the same way until she found my BC pills and condoms. Now, after another relative of mine had a daughter who had a child at 16 she is all on board with BC.  My mom is also a two different kinds of cancer survivor, so she was pretty vocal in the need for the HPV vaccines. 

Funny how things change when it actually happens to you. "
12428,"I thought the shot was only for people who planned to potentiallly have sex with multiple people in the future. The HPV vaccine has other benefits? 

(Disclaimer: I grew up in a highly strict and religious household)"
12429,"Is the vaccine any less effective at this age (I'm 21)? My dad isn't a strict anti-vaxxer, so I got shots for the basic stuff like chickenpox and tetanus, but he was against anything that wasn't absolutely necessary for going to our school. I never got the HPV vaccine, but my mom did sneak me to the doctor a few times for flu shots. I'm going to see if my university health center offers the vaccine"
12430,"When my daughter was 11, her (amazing) GP asked me in a careful way if I would consider the HPV vaccine. I jumped at the chance. The vaccine came out when I was just outside the recommended age. I would have gotten it for myself if I could. Why would any parent deny their child a life free of the worst strains of HPV?"
12431,"Congrats!!! I’m so grateful I got the HPV vaccine. 
Hurrah for modern medicine! "
12432,[removed]
12433,"Is the HPV vaccine something all women should get? 

I honestly don't know a lot about it and I never received the shots. The only time it came up was when I was about to turn 18 and my dad's wife (really disliked her so never referred to her as my step mother) forced me to see a pediatrician one last time. I had never been to that doctor and was scared about getting talked into this vaccine because I didn't know anything about it, and I wanted to talk to my mom about it before getting it. Never got the chance to, so here I am."
12434,[removed]
12435,I think all women should get the HPV vaccine but 10 years ago it was still more than a bit sketch and the concerns were not necessarily grounded in antivaxx mentality.  But good on ya.
12436,[removed]
12437,"Vaccines work, I get it. But why do people not speak up about the few people who have adverse effects. Should we not at least demand that better ones be developed or at least researched while the older versions still get used?

12447,Wtf? Australia is about to have one *less* thing that will kill you?
12448,"I'm not sure if it was included in the discussion but the recommended age for pap smears was raised a year or so ago due partly to the HPV vaccine's success.  Basically that the virus is now so rare in young women, and generally clears up without any problems, that the screening and testing process was causing more harm than good."
12449,"To be fair. The HPV vaccine doesn't prevent all strains of it. Just the most aggressive. Unfortunately my wife never got it, she's now 32, and being treated for precancerous cells. I am thankful she goes to her checkups regularly."
12450,"They started that program when I was in early high school, and it was opt out. Almost every girl in my year got the vaccination through nurses coming to schools (for free even, iirc)"
12451,"Perhaps this is a dumb question but if I'm 30 male and can't get the vaccine (or rather what's the point given I've already been sexually active), as long as I only have sex with girls who have had the vaccine then technically I won't ever get any of the already rare HPV cancers impacting men right?"
12452,"I'm from aus and I got the vaccine through school when i was 15ish, along with all the other girls in my class"
12453,Wow! not only did we get a period off in school we also eliminate cancer! vaccinations are awesome! 
12454,"Yes! I'm Australian and we actually got it in school (for free, I think?). "
12455,"A big part of this is because Australia didn't hand out the vaccine in a sexist manner like other places. We males got vaccinated against it, too, in high school."
12456,"It’s not going to be eliminated, just no longer considered common enough to be a public health concern."
12457,"My mom had me and my sister get the vaccine awhile after it came out. I was 19 I think, so 4 years after it became available. She figured most of the side effects were known by then and wanted me to have it before I became sexually active. I'm really glad she did, even though I twitched when they gave me the shot and my ass hurt for a week because of that. "
12458,"Now they just need to do the same with koala chlamydia.

I'm not joking, it's a serious problem for the koala population."
12459,"Unless they plan on removing all cervices, that is downright impossible. As long as there is living tissue, there will be cancer of that tissue. "
12460,Random question. If you’ve already basically had a small form of cervix cancer - and had it treated - can you still get the vaccine to prevent it from happening again?
12461,"I know, happy I live in Australia. Though it would be taking it a bit too far to say it’d a cure for cancer, that’s what it is."
12462,"Lol, wut? 

My doctor was super religious and went to my family's church. I really wish there was a way to report weird doctors like this. Maybe there is and I'm just not aware. It's awful because they make huge impressions on trusting young patience. My doctor really fucked me up in terms of how I viewed sex and men. It took me just a few months ago to be ok having PiV sex and not become overcome with panic/guilt at the thought of it. Thanks, doc."
12463,"Please tell me you replied, ""Oh, you've got it backwards. He's pleasing me."" 😉"
12464,"Got married last year, switched insurance. New office. The questionnaire asked about number of sexual partners, sexual orientation, oral, anal, sex with someone of the same sex, age I began having sex, and whether or not I masturbated regularly. I didn’t fill it out and asked the (middle aged, female) doctor why it was so invasive. She told me that it was their duty as a healthcare provider to make sure that I was being “sexually responsible” by not engaging in unhealthy behaviors, and that “concerning answers” would lead them to suggest that the person see a therapist about their problems before continuing to have sexual contact with any person. Even a spouse. 

Called, transferred, reported. What the hell. "
12465,"Wait, what doctor asks about the details of your sex life? I've been asked if I'm sexually active but not about the type of sex I'm having."
12466,How professional of him. He's trying to protect you from them boy cooties.
12467,"Here's to hoping he abuses you more!!

.....that came out wrong"
12468,Was that disease....*love*?
12469,"Consensual sex is pretty fantastic. I'm so thankful that I was raised in a manner that allowed comfort with sexuality rather than shame or misunderstanding of it. 

On the doctor issue: my sister was told she couldn't possibly decide she didn't want anymore kids when she talked to her doctor about having her tubes tied. He told her that it was a woman's nature to have and want children, and that she was too immature to decide before she was at least 30. She has 2 kids already. She ditched the doctor, obviously. 
"
12470,That sounds like something you tell the medical board or hospital QA about..
12471,"Sorry for your experience =(

I have a student in my medical school class who remarked the other day that he ""had some serious misgivings about how we as a profession practice medicine and how the healthcare industry works""

I responded by sharing I had some misgivings as well, like in some cases of futile care or how our insurance situation in the US is just atrocious. 

He responded to that by clarifying ""No I mean like these patients who stay on dialysis for years and how unnatural it is to have patients with artifical heart pumps like LVADs. People got along fine without all that before these things were invented""

I was floored. I responded by telling him that ""yea, but those people just died. Society got along, but those individuals died"". He has made some remarks like this in class and I've known him to be quite religious and it all makes me wonder why the hell he wants to be a doctor. We are trying to help the individual get along with whatever ails them and keep them alive or happy/healthy if they so desire. 

Anyway, he seems like the kind of guy to become a PCP who doesn't give anxiety meds to patients because ""people got along fine without them before"""
12472,"So which did you chose? Anxiety or Jesus?! 

^/s"
12473,Witch doctor.
12474,"I had a doc once that asked me if I read my bible every day (because obvs this is medically important) and then prescribed two liters of pop or juice a day to combat my hypotension. 

BRILLIANT, DOCTOR! So instead of low blood pressure I can have HIGH blood pressure, obesity, and no teeth!!

What a fucking quack."
12475,This makes me so upset!!!! I went through the same thing when I was in my teens. I felt pretty weird and didn't understand why a DOCTOR was trying to convince me to believe in God for my depression. I wish I could remember who he was so I could report him. 
12476,Does he also use leeches to cure people of ailments or pray your cancer away?
12477,"I must be privileged.

On Reddit, I always see these pastors fucking kids.

Or doctors saying you're a slut if you open your legs.

I live in Wa. You sound like you live in po dunk Alabama or something. I don't get this.

All of my churches, pastors have been more than open to everyone,any gender or sex. Sex accusations are almost impossible. Doctors are so fucking passive and careful with what they say, I almost want to shout ""DO I HAVE CANCER OR NOT?!?!"" While they timidly think about the correct usage of words to tell me to not offend. 

and then....somewhere in America, some child is getting told that men only want them for sex from a doctor.


"
12478,"In a similar vein I was told for years by every doctor I saw that the agonizing pain I had during my period was normal. I believed them...until I noticed that none of my friends seemed to suffer the same way I did and the pain eventually went from being a few days a month to every single day. By the time I finally found a doctor willing to listen to me I discovered I had stage 4 endo, adeno, and interstitial cystitis and the endo had become so bad that in the weeks leading up to my surgery my intestines stopped functioning entirely (they were completely infested with endo growth and caused multiple organs to begin shutting down). Some doctors are fucking assholes and blow off women's concerns and it's not right. "
12479,What in the actual fuck. How is that person still able to practice. 
12480,"You should write him a nice letter about how he set you  on the right path to peace, because The Prophet (peace be upon Him) has saved you with the help of your Husband’s Sister Wives and the daily ablutions."
12481,"This happened to me, too!! I had an insanely long status migraine (it went on for months and months) and had to see a doctor in order to get a referral to a neurologist. The doctor asked me what my relationship with jesus was like and that he really thinks that will help me get better. He then proceeded to write 6 or 7 new age christianity books he recommended I read. At no point during the short appointment did he examine me in any way and it cost me like a $50 copay. Almighty jackass."
12482,"My doctor told me menopause was ""God's will"" and offered no relief for any of my issues. "
12483,"i saw a dr a year ago who told me that my lupus (an autoimmune disease) would go away once i accepted Jesus. She did some weird “Jesus have this heathen accept you” prayer over me. I was in shock and cried in her office, not for the reasons she thinks..."
12484,"Same! Also, every time I showed up for an appointment (I used to be a very weak child), he’d claim I was faking it so I should just go home and think about my behavior (even though blood tests would prove otherwise)."
12485,"I've had similar experiences in therapy. My mom moved to a remote area for a few years and I came upon some bad times. The only therapists they (her and her husband) would pay for were therapists of their choosing. Her husband is genuinely not a bad person, but he's southern baptist and at the time had a pretty strong influence on my mom's decisions. I ended up homeless after a while. Now I'm a 3.5+ gpa chemistry major, fully medicated and happy as I've ever been.
Edit: when I came upon bad times I had to move back in with her."
12486,"My first and last visit to one primary care doctor, I was sobbing from anxiety and he told me to try harder to get along with my husband. "
12487,"My sister, who is a practicing Christian who also happens to be bipolar, had a pharmacist tell her very recently that if she prayed more, she wouldn't need medication. We thought that was way weird, particularly considering his chosen profession. "
12488,I had a shrink (probably not a licensed one) tell my mom that my epilepsy was caused by evil spirits. 
12489,"That happened to me when I was younger. My pediatrician hugged me and prayed when I told her I felt like I needed a therapist.. apparently God’s the only cure. I didn’t go back to see anyone about it till Maybe 7-8years later

I now have great doctors that deal with my anxiety."
12490,"Okay I am a Christian and have been attending church most of my life, but even I’m like... seriously?! WTH? How unbelievably inappropriate and insensitive of him! "
12491,I am devoutly religious and still have anxiety 
12492,"Seriously OP, you should at least consider it.

Not only highly inappropriate, but really naive of a doctor to say ""you wont need this bc you're never going to have sex"" Wonder if he also didnt like prescribing birth control."
12493,"THISSSSSSSSS!

Can we just not overlook this? That's insane! If my family doctor had spoken to my daughter that way I'd have plastered my knuckles all over his face."
12494,Seriously.  This Doc needs to not only lose his license but be fined immensely.  What a complete piece of shit. 
12495,I’m not so sure that’s the lesser part of the story...
12496,"What if they are in Alabama or some other bible belt state where what the doctor said would be considered just hunky dory? Until we vote these fuckers out, we may have no recourse."
12497,"This. I was a Purity Waits gal and my Doctor was my classmates father and Old School Apostolic ( Like No Tv and his daughters covered their hair. 4 steps from Amish.) and he encouraged me to get on BC and get the HPV vaccination. I remember him telling 17 year old me, "" You may wait but your future husband may not. And that's okay but you need to protect your life and protect him from the devastation if he gives you cancer.  and if you don't end up waiting, you are still safe. ""   


Thanks Anne's dad. You rock. :) "
12498,It’s astonishing how many physicians don’t recommend the HPV vaccine. I worked for my local health department and my job was to share vaccination rates with physicians and counsel them on how to increase adolescent vaccination rates. Some physicians only had 1-2% of their patients vaccinated against HPV
12499,"I was thinking the same. It still shocks me to hear this many stories about doctors imposing their personal or religious beliefs on their medical advice. You have every right to believe what you want, but for the love of God stick to science when advising patients."
12500,"Yep, she's not the only one who would have to be ""good"". I don't even want to think about the number of ""good girls"" who have suffered or died because their spouse gave them HPV. "
12501,Yes that doctor is a huge piece of shit. He needs his license revoked. What kind or person would so grossly abuse his power like this. Fuck that guy. Fuck anti-vaxxers. And just for good measure fuck any doctor who would do shit like this.
12502,"Seriously, one of the best things to happen to me was Planned Parenthood sending someone to our school to talk to us openly about sex and telling us if we ever needed anything to go see them. Got my first pap smear at 15 and the gynecologist I got was amazing. Never made me feel bad or dirty for asking what I needed to know. Let my best friend stay with me. I think my outlook on sex would've been completely different had I got a nutcase like OP."
12503,"Mine just didn’t allow anyone in his practice to prescribe birth control. His solution to my painful death cramps? More ibuprofen!

Mom later admits while he’s a great doctor (he really is, he always checks in on my dad who is dying of cancer and does seem to care) that she didn’t think about the whole birth control thing because she went through menopause before mine started.

But yeah, OPs doctor is skads worse than mine was"
12504,"My first GYN told me he doesn’t prescribe birth control when I asked for it because “we just don’t know all the side effects,” and I had to see another doctor to finally get a prescription for it. Turns out the first doc was catholic. Very frustrating. "
12505,Had a similar experience when I wanted to get on accutane. I went to my dermatologist and he just gave it to me. So I was telling him I was under the impression that I need to take a lot of precautions while on the meds and he didn’t seem to mention anything. So he goes oh no need it’s only risky if you have “free sex” which I’m sure a girl like you doesn’t. Oh and if your vagina feels dry just put some Vaseline in it. I was 21. Just realizing now how fucked up that whole thing was. 
12506,"Yeah damn.. this is the part that really stuck out to me. Congrats OP good on you for overcoming their attempts at conditioning you, I dont want to downplay that in any way but I really want to throw out an extra special ""fuck you"" to that piece of shit ""doctor"". 

Such an egregious misuse of his position."
12507,"They have now changed the age recommendation to women under 40. I originally missed the age cutoff as well, but have gotten it since. It might not be for you, but just putting that out there for anyone who is over 26 but under 40 who thinks it's not for them!"
12508,You could still have gotten it. I was over 26 and paid full price to get it. My GYN had no issue getting it for me.
12509,"Ditto, but having my uterus removed actually turned out to be a blessing for me personally but I know for some women it could’ve been world ending "
12510,"Ask doctors to give it to you. If they won't, ask another! I got my first shot this spring at 34, and will get the last dose just after my 35th birthday. Best of luck and don't give up!"
12511,"There is no cutoff age. It makes absolutely no sense that you can get ""too old"" for a vaccine to work. The vaccine was considered expensive by American insurers, and so they lobbied the FDA to put an age recommendation on the vaccine so that they could deny coverage. I pushed my doctor on it, and she admitted that the age restriction was BS and that even in my 30s I would see a benefit from getting it. I had to demand the vaccine, and pay it out of pocket, but I was able to get it.  


Look it up. Countries like Australia tell people to get it up to age 45."
12512,"I was told anyone could get it, but it was most effective if given 6-12 months before sexually active. "
12513,"Same here. They wouldn’t start the series because the last shot would’ve been after the cut off. I’d still have taken what they could’ve given me, but insurance wouldn’t pay. I just hope they don’t have to pay out way more in the future."
12514,"Yup, and now the age recommednation has changed. So there are just some of us that are ""lucky"" enough to have not been able to get it."
12515,Same here
12516,"I convinced my doctor to let me have it when I was over 26, and somehow my insurance covered it. Here's what I did:

Step 1: I convinced my doctor that I had a low risk of HPV exposure. I prepared a speech that basically went like: *I started having sex in my mid-20s, had a low number of sexual partners, had used condoms consistently, and had never had an abnormal pap.* Doc was hesitant, but I added that I'd be happy to pay out of pocket and that even if it's likely that I'd already been exposed to multiple strains of HPV, it would still be worth it to me to have peace of mind during sex. She said she'd look into giving it to me.

Step 2: Meanwhile, I went to my pharmacist and asked to have it administered to me there. I explained to my pharmacist that my doctor agreed that I should get it and gave a miniature version of my ""why I have a low risk of HPV exposure"" spiel. She (my pharmacist) said respected my decision to prioritize my sexual safety, and she'd be happy to give it to me... except that the pharmacy's policy was not to administer it to anyone over 26 without a prescription. She told me that if I *did* have a prescription, though, my insurance would cover it. She apologized profusely, and I assured her that it was okay.

Step 3: I went back to my doctor a couple weeks later. She told me that she'd looked into the policy, but (she said, apologizing) their state-funded supply of HPV vaccines could only be administered to people 26 and under. I explained that I'd talked to my pharmacist, and that she's be happy to give it to me, *but*... 

""...But she needs a prescription?"" my doctor interrupted, her mood suddenly brightening.

""Yes. Could you...?""

""Of course!""

So I made sure my doctor wrote the prescription for all three shots. I don't know if this matters or not, but I didn't mention to my doctor that my insurance would cover it.

Step 4: I made my way back to the pharmacy that day, and the pharmacist was very happy to give me my shot. :)"
12517,I got it in my early 20s after Gardasil came out. I wish it was available when I was a teen. But I paid $300+ out of pocket to get all 3 shots. I know couple of women who had cervical cancer. 
12518,"I think you can still get it regardless of age (or if you are under 40 maybe?). I looked into it (29) and I could get it BUT at this point Im happily married so if Ive got HPV from a previous partner or my husband, it is what it is.

I was in the UK when it first came out and I was always a year or two over the cutoff (for about 10 years) which made me really mad, by the time they opened it to my age group (when I was 26) I was already engaged.

If you find for some reason you cant get it, make sure you go for your annual PAP smear, then at least any developments can be caught early."
12519,Damn. I should have been more persistent.
12520,"I hated needles as a kid and just didn’t get the importance, and my parents didn’t push it. I saw the light as I grew older and saw my window to get it closing. Decided to get the series with my boyfriend once we settled down. 

He had such a hard time getting the series at 28. He has a sizeable HSA so we decided he could pay retail while I got mine while I was still 25. 

But his primary care didn’t carry it. Walgreens and CVS wouldn’t administer it despite him paying cash and having a prescription from his primary care. So he had to go get Walgreens to distribute it (and only one in our area would even do that!), keep it on ice and drive to his primary care to administer it. 

That was insane. I can’t believe it’s that hard to get for someone under 30 when I walked in, got it, walked out no issue. No regrets, but I wish they’d make it more accessible for people willing to pay the full price in cash. "
12521,I'm 32 and I just got my last dose....are you over 40? 
12522,"My cousin was irked about it too.  I just made it by something like 6 months, she was 2 years over."
12523,"They said I could still get it even though it was after the cutoff age. I asked if there were any risks with doing it at a later than recommended age.  The doctor replied something like, “you may feel a pain in your wallet.” 

I could have gotten it if I’d been willing to pay some price I now forget but that I remember seemed completely out of my range at the time."
12524,Yeah there are multiple types. The vaccines don’t cover all of them and depending on the type of vaccine you got not all the strains are covered. The newer vaccines cover more strains 
12525,"Yeah, I got the vaccine at 15/16 and had an HPV scare (thanks IUD for irritating my cervix so badly they thought I had an STD). Turned out to be nothing, but there are dozens of types and the vaccine unfortunately only covers a few common types. "
12526,"I got the first shot then my mom read some article and decided not to do the rest. Kind of shitty since now I have HPV. My grandmother had cervical cancer that spread and ended up killing her, so that a fun thing to look forward too. "
12527,Same here. 
12528,I feel you. I’ve had multiple colposcopies (which fucking SUCK) and a LEEP. Finally had my first normal pap in 4 years recently. I was in tears from being so relieved. 
12529,My experience was very similar. Please everyone keep up your annual pelvic exams. It’s so important!
12530,"Same. I think I got the vaccine before I was 16. Went in for birth control, doctor offered a Pap. It was downhill from there. Had surgery after they found precancerous cells. Just over five years later, had a Pap during my first appointment after finding out I was pregnant. Nothing abnormal found! "
12531,Came looking for someone who could elaborate on the cancer part. I didn't realize the vaccine prevent cervical cancer and was a bit confused that OP wrote that she didn't have to ever worry about getting cervical cancer. Thanks!
12532,"Same. My paps have been abnormal for 4 years, and I've had 2 colposcopies and it was horrible"
12533,"Me too. We actually got vaccinated at school here in Australia. Parents had to sign a permission slip, of course. The clinic came to our school, all the girls lined up and got our jab. 
10 years later I had an abnormal pap smear and a LLETZ procedure to remove CIN3. 
I rave about pap smears, such an important part of a healthcare checkup for women. My SIL had never had one at nearly 30! When I got my CIN3 results I absolutely hounded her until she went and got one done. Thankfully all clear. "
12534,"Gardasil protects against majority of strains, the newer one."
12535,"Thank you for this reminder!! I too have high risk HPV after getting the vaccine years back. 
Always use protection. It’s so much easier said than done... but we gotta fight for it. I don’t care if it doesn’t feel as great... wrap 👏🏻 it 👏🏻 up 👏🏻 people"
12536,Jesus! How the hell did you get so many?? Is that genetic? Was it.. caught? I don't know how all that happens.. 
12537,My midwife told me they don't do annual pap smears anymore.... every couple years. Was I lied too or do different states recommend different frequency?
12538,"Amen. They just removed cervical cancer from my cervix and now I may need a hysterectomy. Haven't had kids yet.

Hpv is no joke, and cancer is really scary. Everyone should get this vaccine. I wish I could have."
12539,Yes I second this. I had the whole series and still got HPV. The vaccine only covers a few of the strains that are most consistently associated with cervical cancer but there are a couple hundred strains. 
12540,"The vaccine has been greatly improved since then. Currently:

>Last year the country \[Australia\] transitioned from a Pap cervical screening, that detects any changes in the cervix, every two years to **a new HPV cervical test every five years for women ages 25 to 74.** The new test can find cell abnormalities from HPV infections before these have surfaced and is expected to lower mortality and cervical cancer cases by 20% according to the study.

12541,"It's best to get it before sexual activity. If OP has already had any sexual contact (including any skin-to-skin contact), there is still risk for transmission, and the vaccine doesn't protect against previous exposure."
12542,"Yep. Got all 3 guardasil shots as a teen, but now I'm immunosuppressed so I'm more vulnerable to cancer. I have a high risk HPV so I'm getting a voluntary hysterectomy soon. Still glad I got the shots though. "
12543,It is also possible to get cervical cancer without contracting HPV. My mother had it and she used to carry her test results with her to appointments because every doctor assumed she had HPV. She actually just had a very aggressive form of cervical cancer that came on really rapidly after childbirth. By the time my brother was six weeks old she was scheduled for a hysterectomy.
12544,Yup samesies. I was so angry because I did everything “correct”. Regular pap smears are a must 
12545,Who are these fucking doctors? Where did they get their degrees? I can not imagine a professional health care provider speaking to me that way. 
12546,"My doctor told me the same when I was 16 and started to advocate for vaccines myself. They said it was pointless if I had already had sex because you were supposed to get it before you were sexually active. Luckily I decided that it was time to see an adult doctor because that didn't sound right, and they gave it to me. "
12547,"It might still have helped at 14. Technically if you live already been exposed it doesn’t help, but at that age you may not have been. "
12548,I didn’t even know what it was or that it existed till i got it 😁
12549,"People seem to forget that boys need it too. My son is too young still, but my 10 year old daughter just got it a few months ago. "
12550,"My son is fully vaccinated and he had no issue with it when I told him what it was for. It is not only the responsible thing to take care of ones own health, but it’s equally important for their partners and their loved ones, too. "
12551,"this! My 2-year-old is too young, but it is most definitely going to happen. 
I hope by then my insurance will cover it, too, but if necessary, I'll pay out of my pocket for it."
12552,My 11 year old son just had his first one this summer. We go back in six months for the next one.
12553,Thank you for vaccinating your son. 
12554,I didn’t know that boys could also get the shot 
12555,[removed]
12556,I wish my son could get his second shot but he became so violently ill from the first one we had to stop.  I don't know what to do about it now. 
12557,"It’s not too late though, the vaccine can help protect against other strains. Also the one you have may not have been covered by the vaccine anyway."
12558,"I'm still bitter I never even heard of HPV, let alone a vaccine for it until I was in my 20s."
12559,Whaaaart? I went to planned parenthood and just got told that I might have HPV cause of my abnormal results but they didn’t offer me a vaccine. Should I ask for it or is it too late for me? 
12560,"not too late though, unless you won the lottery and managed to get infected by all of the 9 strains the latest vaccine protects against.

Btw those strains cover 90% of rectal warts."
12561,"Can confirm HPV sucks i got strain 16, 18 ? ( my results didnt confirm which strain) but im only 25 y/o I just finished my cryotherapy treatment and will be going back on March of 2019 to see if the treatment worked. If not my Dr said we would have to have a more ""invasive"" treatments. Please go to your check up ladies! you never know. I only found out about my HPV because i wanted to get on BC and my Dr did my papsmear since i hadnt done it in a while and i was overdue, otherwise i never wouldve  known :( "
12562,"Or rape. Ugh. It's a preventative measure, and a doctor needs to explain the risks like any other procedure. "
12563,You can die from an unfaithful husband.
12564,"It's the same people that don't wear a seat belt cause they are ""good driver's"". No one cares whether you are good driver. It's about the guy that t-bones you at an intersection that will kill you. And you'll fly around and kill your passengers.

See how perfect this fits on std antivaxx?"
12565,"No, obviously the man had to be saving himself too or he's just another evil boy who wants her for sex. Right? /s"
12566,"Is this implying you are also his first sexual partner too? Asking for an uneducated on sexual health, married, each other's only sexual partner, friend..."
12567,"I'm curious about this. My mom never forbid me from getting the HPV vaccine, but always told me I didn't need it if I wasn't having sex, and would only have one sexual partner. My husband was also a virgin before marriage, so neither of us should be at risk for HPV, right?

Thinking back, I probably should have gotten the vaccine anyway, just to be safe. My mom also told me I didn't need a pap smear while I was a virgin, but I decided to get one anyway, but then the doctor told me it would hurt too much since I was a virgin, so to wait a year until I was married. Fortunately, a year later my pap came back clean."
12568,Don’t let work get in the way of your health. Nothing there is worth it. Go on your day off and get this done! 
12569,It takes way less time to get the vaccine than to treat cancer.
12570,"Those are the same people that wouldn't vaccinate against HIV if it were possible. It's just such a stupid logic.

It's like not wearing a seat belt because you are a good driver. When that doesn't matter if a truck t-bones you.

You don't have to be promiscuous to catch an STD."
12571,Plus there are other ways to Accidently get HPV
12572,She is bad mouthing her husband for protecting her son. I would highly recommend taking her accusations about her ex with a grain of salt.
12573,"As much as your SO's sister is wrong about her beliefs towards vaccination, I can actually understand her anger if her husband got her son vaccinated without her knowledge. Kid should absolutely get his vaccines but its a pretty shitty thing to do behind the back of the biological parent."
12574,"I come from a conservative Christian family, wasn’t sexually active until I got married to my husband and he wasn’t sexually active until marriage either. Still got the vax with the support and encouragement of my parents and (retired ob/gyn) grandfather. Better safe than sorry. "
12575,"Yup same here! In the UK the jab is free on the NHS for teenagers, but because my conservative Christian mum declined on my behalf, I had to save up £320 to get it done privately as an adult. Even if someone were to marry as a virgin...what if their partner isn't one? Or cheats on them in the far future? Or they break up for whatever reason and get a new partner? It's so ridiculous. But my mum also thinks that ""only married women need to do smear tests"" so.. yeah."
12576,Same here. My mom didn’t allow me to get the HPV vaccine for religious reasons. I’ve never gotten it as an adult either. I guess I should look into it now. 
12577,Very conservative Christian who didn’t believe in science?  Or is that redundant?
12578,Well I'm 35 and have tested positive for 8 of the 9 strains the vaccine is for. Pretty sure in my case it's not necessary and too late. 
12579,"My mom is a conservative Christian, but she still made sure my sister and I got it. When is preventing illness ever a bad thing? I literally don't understand some people's mindset. "
12580,"Am a virgin, still got it as a kid."
12581,[removed]
12582,"Yeah, this doctor was super religious and went to our church. He was also an immigrant from Serbia, which tends to have a very conservative macho culture. I really wish I'd had a different doctor growing up. He really fucked up my views on sex and men for a long time."
12583,"Thank you. I remember I was talking to a medical student and she insisted that her and her colleagues should be able to practice medicine within their own personal beliefs because, ""we have gone through all the trouble of medical school, we should be able to treat people how we want"" and I was just STUNNED. "
12584,"I'm sorry you had to go through that, but yay on your normal pap smear! Cheers! "
12585,"Also, you might get... nothing. You won't get anything.

Except maybe strep throat... because there's no strep vaccine, yet."
12586,"My mom was the same! I got all my necessary vaccinations, but as soon as that doctor started feeding her scare shit about the HPV vaccine, telling her it would instantly kill me or encourage me to have premarital sex, she started getting wacky. Now she won't even allow a microwave in the house because she thinks microwaving food causes cancer."
12587,"I don't think there's an age limit, but 100% double check to be sure. You should talk to a couple doctors and see what they say!"
12588,"No age limit, but the idea is to vaccinate before sexual activity so your body can build up immunity prior to any exposure to the virus. But you can still get it, and I probably would, theres no guarantee you’ve been exposed to the dangerous strains already. "
12589,"I’m a gynecologic epidemiologist. I say go ahead and get it. It may or may not help you, but it definitely won’t hurt you."
12590,"You sure can, thing is that once you had contact with the virus, which is very probable due to the high level of endemic infection the vaccination has not been proven to be effective. In other words post immunisation does not work. In germany the vaccination is mainly done in girls at the ages 11 - 14 since it needs to be administered before the first sexual encounter. But in all cases you should talk to a capable (!) physician and seek their advice since it always depends on the situation. 

EDIT: The only pathogenic types of HPV are 16 and 18. This is a very low number of the 150 types overall, so the chances you have not been in contact with obe of those can, depending on your sexual activity, be very high. In those cases a vaccination still is advisable i guess. But for most effective protection you should always have your kids vaccinated as soon as possible to make sure.
"
12591,"Theres no scientific reason for the age limit and there was only financial reason for the first vaccine that only covered two strains.

The current vaccine covers 9 cancerous strains and protects against 90% of genital/anal warts.

In addition those HPV strains don't only cause cervical cancers but also throat/rectal and penile cancers.

In addition to that even if it does not cause cancer in you, you can still transmit it to your partner.

The reason why men were excluded in the beginning also were solely financial.

  


Thus the vaccine is useful for anyone that ever has sex no matter their sexual orientation, and even for religious people that don't have sex before marriage. Because your partner might have had sex."
12592,"Im almost 35 with very few partners (long relationships) and had clean pap tests but they refused me twice saying I was too old. If anyone knows how I can get the vaccine still, I'd want to know as well"
12593,"22 male here, I got it a year ago. ""Oh guys dont need it. It's only really for girls."" Bullshit. Not all women can get it. So shoot me up so I dont get and spread the virus. Now I'm vaccinated."
12594,My PCP said I was too old...I’m mid-40s. Obv the vaccine wasn’t a thing when I was a teen. 
12595,"I’m 20, I just got the first round last month. It’s approved for people under 26, though. It’ll probably be out of pocket for you."
12596,"I'm over 35, and spoke with my Dr about it a few years ago when I was single and mingling. He said it's not pushed for those over ~25 because they tend to have fewer new sexual partners than those under ~25. And if new partners were likely in my future, it was a good idea to get it."
12597,"Tehnically there are no age restrictions but there are CDC guidelines as to who should get what when that insurances use to determine what to pay for and pharmacy's use to draft their standing orders in states where they can give it. Last I check the top age was 24 for men. This doesn't necessarily mean you can't get it, but you should talk with your doctor about pros and cons and also may have a difficult time getting insurance to pay for it."
12598,"It depends what country you're in, but if your insurance (assuming you have it) won't cover it, you can pay for it out of pocket. It's expensive, though."
12599,"I got it when I was 24, in 2007/8. The age cutoff used to be 26, but now the comments on this post indicate the max age may be 40. It's never too late!

Edit: it may be too late if you already have HPV..."
12600,26 for insurance coverage 
12601,Hi! Would you mind if I DM you? I got recently told I have HPV but the doctor was just “You have it. Good luck. Come back in a year.” I just want to hear about your experience. 
12602,Agreed! I got the vaccine in my late teens before I was sexually active and found out I had HPV around 22. I’ve had on and off again abnormal papa ever since. I will never stop getting regular check ups. 
12603,The vaccine does not protect against all the strains. Sorry about your grandma!
12604,I got the vaccines at 15-16 years old and had cancerous cells at age 20. The vaccine doesn’t cover every strand of HPV.
12605,"I find it really interesting that I grew up in a fairly religious Catholic household that frowns upon premarital sex and yet I was downright encouraged to get this vaccine by my (also Catholic) doctor and mother. I really am very appreciative that my parents are huge supporters of vaccines and medicine in general, no matter how socially/ fiscally conservative they may be. I should thank them the next time I see them..."
12606,"When a doctor told me I had hpv I didn’t even know what she was talking about. She sounded so serious on the phone and I was like. “Yeah ok thanks I guess?”

Seriously wish my docs would ELI10 all the time.  My pharmacist had to tell me I was taking the Pil wrong!"
12607,Of course. I know it doesn't cover all forms. But I'd rather be protected against some than none.
12608,"Yes, it just helps minimize the risk factor. "
12609,Yeah you don't need a Jewish mom freak out if you've got it covered
12610,It's never too late. Ask your doctor or if in Canada you can just talk to a pharmacist too.
12611,"It may seem silly, but make yourself set aside just 5 minutes tomorrow to call your PCP or local pharmacy and ask if you can get it. Just a short phone call can give so many answers and it may help set your mind at ease! I had my shots at 16 and I'm so glad I did. "
12612,"Pharmacist here- if you didn’t get as a child it is not too late. 
  The vaccine schedule for HPV cuts off at like 22, but if you didn’t receive it, it is still extremely valuable (and recommended) to get at 32. "
12613,"What? Do people really think getting a vaccine is ""slutty""? That sounds incredibly odd to me.

-edit-

That anyone would think that, that is."
12614,"Why 14 up? Judging from the average first time sex age, quite a lot of kids start earlier with their peers, and it's most sensible to vaccinate before they start engaging in sexual activities. "
12615,"A lot of countries have exactly that. Every girl in New Zealand gets the HPV vaccine in high school, and all of us get a few other ones like meningitis. It’s not just permission to go to the doctors either, they actually come to school and vaccinate everyone on the same day."
12616,"Wait...that isn’t a thing in your country? In Australia we get this vaccine in school, I got it at 15 but nowadays it’s at 13 for boys and girls. Like, we all line up and get the shot at school from visiting nurses and it’s free.  "
12617,[removed]
12618,We have a program like this in Australia (except the parents know). Ihad immunisation nurses come to my school and received all my HPV vaccines in high school!
12619,"The moment you turn 18 go for it! I wish I hadn't waited this long, but better late than never. It was super easy too. I just made a regular physical and told the doctor I'd like to get the vaccine. A few minutes later a nurse came and administered it. It hurt a bit, but totally worth it "
12620,Check out either Planned Parenthood or your Public Health Dept. Depending on where you are you might be able to get it yourself. 
12621,I’m not sure where you’re from but are you not able to seek medical care without parent or guardian involvement from 16? I’m Australian though so it may not be relevant to you but also worth checking out :) 
12622,"Just wanted to throw this out there: people with juvenile RA  (rheumatoid arthritis) can't get vaccinated while under certain treatments. Even after they're done, vaccines still pose a threat in that they can cause a flare up of unknown severity and duration. I'm sure there will be people who will say that a flare up is better than death via flu, but unless you personally have RA you couldn't possibly know. RA is highly debilitating and simply sucks. So yes, in theory, you should get the vaccines but not if you feel it's not worth the potential aftermath."
12623,It definitely hurt a bit! My arm was kind of sore afterwards but I don't really feel any discomfort now.
12624,"That doctor immigrated from Serbia, which has a very macho and conservative culture. He was also extremely religious. I think that probably played a big role in it."
12625,">Sounds like you need to get far away from your mother


Anti vaxxers are dumb as shit but you don't destroy a relationship with your family or mom because of a disagreement like that."
12626,Yeah that's why I didn't have mine in school. I'm thinking about getting it though as I'm only early 20s 
12627,"According to the interwebs- 26 is the cutoff point for when it is recommended. Apparently you may need to pay some out of pocket expense after 20, but all you need to do is go to your doctor and ask for it. "
12628,Absolutely! See your GP asap
12629,"It’s because they think we can’t make informed choices and therefore shouldn’t have full bodily autonomy. These people need to be pushed out of professions where they advise, help or create laws that negatively impact 50% of the population."
12630,Knowing that you have that is half the battle. The good part? You can *use* that privilege to help those of us who don’t have it. Speak up! Defend women and minorities when you see or hear people saying bullshit. Call them out in public. Support the voices of women and minorities on social media and in politics. You can help! 
12631,"Gardasil is a vaccine against HPV, and HPV can cause cervical cancer. Gardasil, therefore, *lowers* your risk of developing cervical cancer. That doctor is misinformed. 

Gardasil is a trade name for HPV vaccines, so it's fairly interchangeable. Sort of like saying ""sharpie"" when referring to a permanent marker. "
12632,"> she brought up the fact that it did not matter for her children 21(boy) and 17(girl) because they were both brought up well and neither they or her children’s spouses would have sex until marriage

I'd bring up that sexual assault is a thing, and HPV can be passed along just fine that way regardless of their own decisions about their sexual proclivities. Better to be vaccinated regardless. "
12633,"If you have sex, you're at risk. Your partner could have had previous partners and been exposed that way. They could cheat. You could be sexually assaulted and infected that way. You could also end up widowed or divorced and eventually wind up with another partner, etc etc. 

It's better to be vaccinated and protected, as you simply don't know what will happen in the future. "
12634,"Good thing you’ll never get cervical cancer, seeing as you don’t have a cervix. "

They do... They're literally listed on the VIS.

>Should we not at least demand that better ones be developed or at least researched while the older versions still get used?

They are. Constantly. Like, at all times."
12640,No one is saying we shouldn't continue to improve vaccines.
12641,"You seem sincere, so allow me to shed some light.

No matter how bad the possible risks of vaccines, they are an insignificant fraction of the risk of not having the vaccine.

Let's entertain the ridiculous notion that vaccines somehow cause autism. Even if this were true (it's not), the risk of polio, smallpox, mumps, rubella, etc. is far higher and far more severe than the chance or impact of autism (which again is NOT caused by vaccines).

Even if antivaxxers were right (they're not), they would still be wrong in the risk analysis.

And that's why you're getting downvoted. Even if you were right, that we should be more informed about adverse effects, this is a tiny, tiny risk relative to the risk and impact of not being vaccinated. Therefore, even getting people to hesitate when it comes to vaccines is a deadly, unintended consequence. People recognize this and so anyone who even puts up the slightest barrier, psychological or otherwise, is going to get crucified because the risk analysis bears out that this is the best behavior for collective self-preservation."
12642,I already made an informed decision.
12643,"You’re an anti-vaxxer who claims that vaccines cause autism when there is absolutely no credible medical or scientific evidence that vaccines cause autism. Do you know why children are being diagnosed with autism more frequently now than in the past? Because more doctors than ever know about autism and can properly diagnose it now. Before they were misclassified as retarded and thrown in sanitarium or, if they were high-functioning, classified as weird. Hell, even girls are very hard to diagnose today because they’re better at mimicking social behavior than boys are. Even adults are getting diagnosed with autism in adulthood because they slipped through the cracks 10, 20 years ago.

The reason it seems like children develop autism after a vaccine is because by and large they seem to develop normally and then at around 2-4 (I may be off on the age), then they regress and the autism symptoms develop. As far as I’m aware, scientists don’t yet know what causes autism, but the evidence does not point at vaccines. If anything it’s probably tied to genes the same way everything else is, but that’s purely my own conjecture. I have no evidence and could be wrong, which is different from what you’re doing by saying you’re definitely right.

I know your son has autism and I’m sorry for that. But vaccines didn’t give your child autism. And making false claims and perpetuating them and preaching them as facts is absolutely a shitty thing to do because you could influence another ignorant person to make a bad decision that harms their child. And I agree that we should all do what’s best for us, but if we are to live in a society and allow our actions to harm others as a result, that’s not okay. And pushing books based on fear-mongering and junk science only makes it harder for people to make evidence-based decisions."
12644,1000000% worth the incredibly minimal risks. Vaccinate your damn kids.
12645,"I hope your daughters (and sons, if you have any) don't develop preventable forms of cancer because some social media types convinced you that the risks are significant or even approaching any kind of worrisome amount."
12646,You mean the one risk of having a very rare egg allergy??? The only risk associated with basically any vaccine? The one that results in no permanent damage because you get the vaccine in a medical facility equipped to handle anaphylaxis?
12647,"So, your daughter makes a huge leap from absolute dependence on you at age 17 to absolute independence at age 18? Do you not value your daughter's autonomy to protect herself as early possible?

I understand the risks part. I will never get LASIK surgery because it is elective (I can wear glasses/contact lenses for life and be okay), and if something goes wrong, I'm not getting another pair of eyes any time soon. But with vaccines, there is verifiable proof that years are added to lives because of the protection they give to a population. Cancer, pertussis, measles, *anything* vaccine related is worth protecting against. There are risks to any medical procedure from brain surgery to Band-Aids, but vaccines are MUCH closer to Band-Aids than most interventions out there.

I hope you can find trusted sources to change your mind about the risks. I'm convinced nothing I give you would change your mind."
12648,And the risk of not getting it is fucking cancer. That's worse.
12649,What risks occur with a prevalence warranting exposing your daughters to an increased chance of cervical cancer?
12650,So.....cerivcal cancer is an acceptable risk?
12651,Risk is much higher they get cancer than they die from the vaccine. 
12652,*What risks?*
12653,"Do you stop your daughters wearing seat belts or looking before they cross the road?
Or is it just diseases you want them to die or be seriously Ill from?

"
12654,Meanwhile you'll continue to drive them around in a car which 100x more dangerous.
12655,There is almost no risk to getting it and massive risk to not getting it.
12656,It may very well be too late by then. Be a good parent and take them for their HPV vaccine. Your sons shojuld get it oo because the HPV virus causes throat cancer in men.
12657,"I have done ""real research"". Just because my research consisted of sources backed by real medical professionals and not random, unqualified mommy bloggers doesn't mean I was ill informed. "
12658,Found the paid shill using a zombie/lapsed account.
12659,Way to be supportive
12660,Which doctor? My new one who gave me the vaccine or the old one who slut shamed and endangered a little child?
12661,Huh?
12662,"I told my mom about this and all she had to say was ""what does the evidence say about the side effects of the vaccine"". I wanted to say ""well mom people get these gray hairs and wrinkles. You know, they AGE and don't DIE of CANCER."""
12663,You seem fucking awesome.  I hope my daughter grows up to be as awesome as you.
12664,"I was at Uni in 2007 when they rolled it out. Literally every girl I knew went and got it, all payed for by the government. It was amazing."
12665,"Not to play devil’s advocate here, but, despite your Mom’s reasoning or the evil things that your pediatrician suggested, aren’t you empowered knowing that you got to decide, as an adult, whether or not you wanted that vaccine? I think it’s a great thing if the vaccine continues to positively effect the rate of cervical cancer cases reported, but, if I’m not mistaken, that particular vaccine has some pretty serious health risks when administered to young girls. Risks that are greatly reduced when the vaccine is taken as an adult. Or at least 18(I don’t really consider 18 year olds across the board to have reached adulthood though..)"
12666,"> technically I won't ever get any of the already rare HPV cancers impacting men right

If you've already been exposed to HPV then it's a bit late for that, isn't it? You could potentially still develop them if so, if I understand correctly. "
12667,"Unfortunately, vaccines aren’t sexually transmitted. An expert can give you more technical details about why vaccines work, but in laymen’s terms: 

Vaccines work by giving our immune system a chance to build immunity against these viruses. They expose people to inert, controller, benign versions of the virus in a way that helps our immune system quickly recognize and rid of the virus, if the full version comes around. They give our bodies a fighting chance against a potentially dangerous enemy that might wreak devastation before we would usually be able to rally the troops. The vaccine itself clears from our system eventually. 

That said, if you have sex with someone who has had this vaccine, it is very very unlikely that they can pass on the inert, benign trainer-viruses. It’ll also be very unlikely that they will carry the viruses that the vaccine protects against. Your immune system receives no training or immunity from having sex with someone who has the vaccine. "
12668,"If the cancer was caused by the virus, and the *cancer* was treated, the virus is still sticking around. The vaccine is to prevent the virus in the first place, so I'd think it wouldn't be any use at that point. However, I'm not a doctor, so it'd be best to still talk it over with a doctor in the case that it was a cancer not caused by the virus, so the vaccine would still be useful. "
12669,State medical licensing board.
12670,There is! It’s as easy as googling “report doctor complaint to medical board [your state].” He deserves to have his license revoked before he endangers any more young women. 
12671,"I never knew I was so blessed to have a competent gyno (been seeing him since I started my period) I could tell him I had a threesome in Japan with strangers and he would be like “ok so we will do a full infection panel maybe some blood work just in case, how was the rest of your year?” Because uh he’s a doctor, I tell him everything that might pertain to my health, and he takes that information and uses it to better my treatment... 
apparently I’m spoiled, 
I’m so sorry that happened to you and so many other women, “judgmental doctors” should be an oxymoron."
12672,"I dont see how somebody can be a doctor who super religious. Iget religious, but this is just a contradiction. This man should never be allowed to practice medicine/hurt/damage again. "
12673,...a disease preventable with the HPV vaccine! Full circle. 
12674,There are also online reviews for doctors.   
12675,Please actually report this. This is exactly something the medical board would want to know about. Give them details. You could literally save lives in the process. 
12676,"I wish I’d been so clever. Definitely had a deer in headlights moment where I just felt guilt about myself. It’s crazy to hear about situations like these happening and thinking I’d be all fired up and have a quippy feminist retort, but when it happened I was FROZEN. 

Sigh. 😅"
12677,"I am so confused as to which of those things would trigger their ""unhealthy behaviors"" alert. Weird. "
12678,"I’m so sorry, this is awful. The real reason that they have to ask those questions is because doctors need to be more aware of “risky” sexual behaviors like multiple partners so that they can ask histories from their patients and advise them about condom use, birth control, and STI testing. The questions are NOT supposed to be used as some tool for the doctor to judge you and send you to “therapy” for based on their own beliefs, that’s extremely wrong and you should report your doctor to the state licensing board if she said this. "
12679,"Gynecologist, coincidentally he was also the doctor that delivered me. It was a checklist of sexual behaviors I suppose to determine if I need any specific screenings? "
12680,"The type of sex is asked during sexual histories because certain infections like Herpes manifest differently based on if they are transmitted orally, anally, or vaginally.  Docs are supposed to ask this in order to just be more aware of what diseases the patient is at risk for. "
12681,😂! And why didn’t he tell me to stop abusing my fiancé? Cause that oral sex definitely goes both ways...
12682,It’s been 17 years since I left his practice.  I wonder how that would work.
12683,This is how hospitals all over the rural south are. Been to two different ones (the only ones within reasonable distance) asking for mental health resources (I just moved to the area and was having trouble finding help) and both times I just got church invitations and them offering to pray for me.
12684,Shouldn’t a medical student be happy that the average life expectancy is now higher than 35 because of advances in medicine and technology?  It would freak me out teaching that student.  Kinda sounds like someone that would OD patients on purpose if he thought it was their time to go.
12685,"Wow what the hell. Seriously. LVADs are amazing and fascinating examples of technology making people’s lives better.  Young doctors should be excited as hell to see patients benefiting from that kind of technology. I can’t imagine initiating care with a young doctor and having to deal with that kind of philosophy. 

Perhaps he’s a good fit for hospice care?  "
12686,"I went to the doctor for anxiety meds. The doctor kept asking if I was depressed, I kept telling him no, but I felt like I was about flip out. He proceeded to tell me since I wasn't depressed I didn't need anything.

My father in law came over to my house later that week, drunk, and proceeded to pee in my living room floor. I flipped out and broke his ribs throwing him out of my house. I needed meds! "
12687,"As a patient.. my last pcp who my ins dropped after multiple complaints.. told me and I quote 

""We are not a drug seeking clinic"" when I asked if they could help me figure out my anxiety and possible depression. I initially tried to explain that I was having anxiety attacks that I wanted to be sure wasn't related to any heart issue since it mostly presented with chest pain.  But at every turn they refused to even discuss these things, even when I asked for a referral for a therapist they ignored it. (Which I only asked for because I need a PCP referral for therapy to get a referral for a psychiatrist since they refused for ins approval)"
12688,"Had a buddy my freshman year of college who was incredibly religious. Homeschooled guy, very smart and hard working. He got into med school a couple years ago and I imagine this is exactly the type of student he was. "
12689,[deleted]
12690,"I understand your concern, especially given that he's going to be deciding medical intervention for other people!  It's lucky he's your student, because then what if you make him write an essay on what exactly ""people got along fine"" means?  It sounds like a phrase he never had to scrutinize or defend. "
12691,"That should be enough to get him kicked out of med school. He’s showing a disdain toward helping sick people, for cripes sake! "
12692,"Its like all those natural birth c-section-is-terrible home-birth advocates. They say ""women have given birth naturally for thousands of years!"" Yeah, and many died trying. In fact 1/3 of all women's deaths before the advent of modern medicine is attributed to complications during or after labor. 1/7 labors were fatal to at least one party involved. I'd rather try for a natural birth in the HOSPITAL and get a c-section/blood transfusion/antibiotics/any other intervention if I need it and get to live on to tell the story to my kid. "
12693,People with those ideologies shouldn’t be given a medical license.
12694,"Does he have to pass ethics before he graduates?
Patient care is key, but perpetuating or contributing to a flawed system needs to stop in college, right? "
12695,I'm pretty religious bit I also feel like life is better living through chemistry. Science and religion aren't mutually exclusive. 
12696,Don't med students have to take ethics at some point? This kind of mind set would be a huge red flag for any ethics prof I'd imagine...
12697,"Wow. He sounds like one of those sects that frown upon modern medicine, like Jehovah's Witness  or Christian Scientists, who deny blood products because ""it's God's plan"".

I used to work doing filing at a law firm where they defended doctors and hospitals for malpractice. I saw quite a few cases with Jehovah Witness couples who had their kids taken away by CPS and then they were suing the kid's doctor for providing life saving treatment. It was often for things like inherited anemia where they need blood products every so often forever. So insane! 

Why does he even want to be a MD? To lord over people? Smh. "
12698,That guy sounds like he's going to harm some people with his shitty ideology. I hope he fails out. 
12699,I've never heard *religious* objections to those devices; conservative Christian & Jewish groups generally favor anything that causes life extension. That sounds more like the guy who used to be governor of Colorado wanting to put retirees into concentration camps or some such
12700,Please document and let the school know.  Please.
12701,Mostly CBD and medical marijuana.  Lol
12702,"I can vouch for just how toxic this idea is...I have suffered from anxiety and depression for about a decade (likely longer pre-diagnosis). My very religious family was not explicitly against medication but made it clear that anything can be prayed away. I wrestled with so much guilt and anxiety about taking medication - and what that meant - that I avoided it for years. Finally I got on meds and I wondered why I hadn’t tried sooner. I’m now on a daily dose and I’m doing so much better. 

Also worth noting some of the more “natural doctors” and chiropractors tend to talk bad about pharmaceuticals. Be aware that no single intervention is magical or evil or one size fits all. Try a few approaches to see what works best is my personal advice to other sufferers."

And cycling water faster through your body without adjusting anything else is the last thing you want to do if you have low blood pressure, unless that low blood pressure is the very transient reactive form encountered in response to acute dehydration.

Unless something fairly specific was wrong, the firstline treatment is just ""add a bag of potato chips [or anything else salty] to your diet""."
12709,"My mom passed away when I was 15 and the anxiety started soon after.  I grew up in a very small town, and the doctor knew that my mom had passed and that I had stopped going to church several months before she passed."
12710,"When I was 14, I had a doctor not perform surgery on my shin( clean break and then a 7 piece fracture a few inches lower). Because God was going to heal it. I'm 23 now and I have a lump on my shin, still have a limp, my leg aches all winter long, and bumping it is worse than getting kicked in the balls. Idk if surgery would have helped anyway, but I didn't really like the reasoning "
12711,"Actually, there are medical uses for leeches, like when a finger is reattached, or so I understand."
12712,"Heh, you kinda stepped in this one.  Medevil physicans had some wacky ideas on medicine, but some of it had some real practical value.

Another notable is that staples are actually better than closing a wound with stitches.  The romans managed to figure that one out and yet today were still using fucking stiches."
12713,"It’s in WA (washingtonian holla) too if you look hard enough. Had an OBGYN who was Mormon and told me straight to my face that if I have sex with multiple partners my IUD won’t be as effective since all the different types of sperm will compromise the birth control. He wouldn’t give it to me unless I promised I was going to me monogamous. I just wanted my IUD and got the hell out of there. 

I’ve told every OBGYN I’ve seen this story. They can’t actually believe it. "
12714,"I live in WA state. When I was 20 I went to the doctor because I was doubling over with intense stomach cramps.  They decided to give me my first pap smear while checking me out as I had never had one and had very heavy periods.  

During the appointment there were the usual questions.  When I answered that I was not sexually active, the doctor didn't believe me.  He asked two more times accusing me of lying.  When I was nearly in tears he asks, ""How is that possible?!""  WTF was I supposed to say?  ""Cuz I have standards."" Or ""Cuz nobody wants me and I have never been on a date?""  Finally I just yelled that my mom is out in the waiting room, and she will confirm what I am telling them.

During the pap smear I was crying from humiliation and had to listen to the doctor and nurse chat about the worst pap smear they performed/had."
12715,"Same.

My pediatrician actually recommended that I get the HPV vaccine when I was 15-16, and I was the one going, ""Ha! Me, having sex?! As if!"" and ""I don't want to, because I'm afraid of needles!"" I came to my sense when I was 18 and have since received all three shots in the series."
12716,"Education is important, and something these flyover states don’t get enough of.

Not that the education system isn’t reprehensible throughout the entire US, but especially bad in these places"
12717,"It's weird, I live in ME and used to think the same, that every place but here was weird in some way. Maine sexual education is done like grade 7, and then again in high school and everyone pretty much knows the pros and cons and how to be safe and blah blah, but that is largely supported by the local population and teen pregnancies are rare. Doctors are honestly pretty straightforward, but also some may be more apt to prescribe something harder than you need. It's racism that is veiled by some people. I know most are really good about it in Maine, but some hide it. I just hear about it from coworkers that tell me how they or their friends get treated as away help. Each place it seems has its skeletons, if it isn't one thing it certainly is another thing. "
12718,"How many stories do you see about people with  completely normal doctor visits? It is like anything else on the internet, you hear about the crazy shit that happens not about the 99% of people that have a completely normal experience. "
12719,"I'm a doctor and I'm hella blunt. I've gotten in actual, real trouble by telling folks bad news in a real life way. 

I *hear* you. I really, really do. But I gotta say, there is a reason most doctors are pussies about bad news.

However, if you want the truth that will keep you alive and happy-ish, I'm happy to be your pediatrician."
12720,Idiots  like this Doctor don't even consider the possibility of sexual assault when playing out their unrealistic chastity fantasies in their minds.
12721,"My mom said that.  My doctor was like ""its ddefinitely less risky for her if she isn't having sex, but it's still a good idea regardless.""

I havent had the HPV vaccine.  I should get that."
12722,"Fuck the doctors who are reluctant to hand out birth control. BC is the only reason why I don't have migraines four times a week anymore. It's good for things other than letting girls get freaky no strings attached. Hell, mine drastically reduced my libido so it turned me into a ""good"" girl. Go figure."
12723,I had a doctor who would only prescribe me birth control if I promised to not have premarital sex. 
12724,I'm curious if he gave the same advice to any male patients?
12725,"I'm going to reaffirm this. But instead of considering it I would suggest you do it. 

Medicine is not a field where the practitioners personal ""morals"" should even be relevant. 

Doctors are obliged (often under oath no less). To provide proper care for their patients. Those who fail to do this (especially if it's willful negligence and not plain negligence) have no business practicing. "
12726,Or performing pap smears.
12727,"Exactly, cancer doesn't care about morals."
12728,Not to mention him telling you that only “bad girls would need it” and your a “good girl” that’s fucking outrageous and just wrong.
12729,"You KNOW he didn’t prescribe birth control.  He would say “birth control is only for THOSE kinds of girls.  You don’t want to be one of THOSE girls, do you?   Think of your parents’ shame if they found out.  I know you will never be one of THOSE girls dear. “"
12730,Can GPs prescribe birth control in the first place? I was told they couldn't and that you have to explicitly go to a gyno for it.
12731,"The problem is that he was probably the family doctor *because* he did this kind of thing, and there wasn't any other doctor around that was anti-vaxx. The sad truth is that the family deliberately put her into a situation with a medical advisor they knew to be toxic.

I wonder if there's any abuse case to be made there."
12732,yeah but sounds like the mom agrees with the dr
12733,"> I'd have plastered my knuckles all over his face.

Whether you are using hyperbole or not, can I weigh in on this? 

Please abandon this attitude. Let the law do the punching. Compel politicians, lawyers, medical officials, the DEA - whomever - let  them do the fighting. 

***

A recent article published this week, either in the NYT or the WaPo (I can't find it but they talked about it on NPR) - they got some stories from women who were afraid to report after they were assaulted as teenagers. 

One thing that came up a few times was concern over how the father would react. Most of the time, it wasn't the ""my father will disown me"" or ""he'll think I'm a slut"" worry, but it was the ""he will take care of justice outside of the confines of the law.""

Women who were assaulted were worried about losing their fathers. They were worried that the father would react emotionally and beat up/kill the assailant, landing him in jail for murder/attempted murder/assault. 

These victims were already terrified over what they lost to their attackers. Staying silent was a method for them to not lose more. 

Portraying an environment of understanding, trust, and coolheadedness is far better. If you're not worried about someone in your family going to jail for being a vigilante, you might report an attack sooner. "
12734,And you would end up in jail while most likely having your child taken from you...
12735,Right? I guess good girls are never victims of rape or incest either. I feel bad for his patients:(
12736,"No, there is recourse for medical malpractice. He is violating professional ethics rules, he is in a position to have his license revoked."
12737,"You’re right, but if nobody complains, those fuckers aren’t even going to know anyone disagrees with them"
12738,"Lol we Alabamians don’t just consider them hunky dory, we elected one for [governor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_J._Bentley). In a rare moment of lucidity tho, we impeached him and sent him to jail for a little while. Not for any of the nasty stuff I’m positive he’s done as a doctor, unfortunately, but for some pretty boring campaign finance bs"
12739,"You would be surprised at how many good people are in the Bible Belt that are not completely ignorant. I have had some great doctors and I have had some not so great doctors lol. 

Our pediatrician states on her website if you do not vaccine 100% do not even bother registering with the practice. :) "
12740,I'm in Alabama. My children's pediatrician wouldn't accept them as patients unless they were vaccinated. 
12741,"Alabamian here. Report that shit. Just because my Gran has that ideology doesn't mean the medical board does, or should. "
12742,"Hell, I'm from AL and that shit doesn't fly here either. That doctor's an idiot that needs to be punished."
12743,"In Alabama, and in medical field- doctor may not be committing malpractice, but ethically & morally he is reprehensible. Would not be considered “hunky dory” by any of my colleagues.
   I’m assuming (wherever he is) he is a very very old, small town, family doctor, who is close friends with the family. Doctor was probably in practice for years before vaccine was released and suffering from same lack of education as parents. 
  "
12744,"I live in Alabama and they take shit like this seriously there, too. Unfortunately, many people don't know the proper way *to* file a complaint so nothing tends to happen until someone dies or gets severely sick. It goes for a lot of places, not just Alabama..."
12745,"The great thing about state licensing boards (and ethics boards) for doctors; they are often staffed by doctors who live in the state, but get an education elsewhere.

"
12746,The doctor gives their medical advice. They can’t force anyone to do anything. The fact that their advice is not based in the realm of medical science is malpractice. Their license should be revoked. The government may not have standards but science does. 
12747,"From Alabama and work in a medical practice, so can confirm that this is not accurate. You are obligated to provide all the options to your patients as a medical professional, no matter your own beliefs.  "
12748,"I'll admit, that's not the ending I expected to that story. That's a good doctor."
12749,"I’m over 26, under 40, didn’t get HPV until after 26 and have to somehow figure out how to juggle treatment cost, work, my children, etc while living with cervical cancer I can’t afford to treat. I wanted the vaccine 3 months before I was 26, insurance said no, my age disqualified coverage, but I hadn’t turned 26 yet"
12750,Do you have a source for this? I still see 26 on the CDC website. 
12751,"I was in my mid-20s when the vaccine came out (approx 10 years ago). My insurance-provided doctor and a free-clinic doctor both told me that I didn't need it because I was at the top end of the recommended age group and that I didn't have a history of irregular paps. The clinic doctor even told me not to believe everything that I see/hear on TV, as if I was shopping for designer drugs...."
12752,"Holy shit! Didn't know that, guess I'll be getting mine."
12753,That is awesome! I missed the cutoff and was really disappointed to not add it to my collection. I will get it ASAP!
12754,"Good to know. I’ll see if I can get it now, I’m still under 40. :)   Thanks!"
12755,Is this for the US?!  I was under the anti-vax spell when it was available to me and I've been kicking myself in the ass about it since!
12756,Is this true? My doc refused to give it to me years ago when I was only one year over the limit. 
12757,So do you not have much risk for HPV once you hit 40?
12758,"I'm finding out from a doc soon if they will give me the last three at age 29. Got the first right before turning 26- paid out of pocket and didn't have the money for the rest. Insurance did nothing back then, so here's hoping my current plan will help if the doc does recommend it. :P 

At least my doctors were recommending the series of vaccines when I was a teen... my parent just wouldn't allow it. It's terrible that there are doctors who put religious ideals before a patient's health. "
12759,"Most insurance companies won't cover it if you're over 26 though. I hope that changes if the science is saying it's still effective after that age, but right now it prices it out of reach for a lot of people."
12760,This is good information. I'm going to tell my wife about it.
12761,Lots of doctors were really weird over this particular vaccine.  I was 26 and a virgin when it came out.  Tried to pay several doctors cash to get it.  None would give it to me because it was only recommend for people under 25.  Frankly the way the vaccine was handled when it first came out was ridiculous and cost a lot of people getting cancer.
12762,"You can, if your insurance doesn’t cover it it’s pretty expensive though. :/ America!"
12763,"Isn't there only two doses, like, a couple weeks apart?

Is it a scheduling thing or has the vaccine gotten more complicated since the last time I tried getting it?"
12764,"I believe that their reasoning was that by 26, most people probably already have it (it's something like 70% of adults in Canada).       

But there are so many strains, surely it's possible to have had the warts strain and then get the cancerous strain, no? Which would be a good reason for no cut-off on vaccinations. Up here we are also really into preventive treatment, as I think most countries with socialized medicine are, so it's an oddity.

Of course, originally they weren't vaccinating men either, but thankfully that's changed here now. Everyone in grade 9."
12765,"Realistically, there is no cut off age for effectiveness of the vaccine, provided a individual doesn't already have one of the cancerous strains. That being said, I think the angle the CDC recommendation was coming from was perceived benefit to cost analysis "
12766,What about ages for men? I asked my bf if he had gotten it and he said he was too old by the time someone explained it to him why boys should get it even though it's for cervical cancer.... we were talking about how many times I've seen boys asked on base if they wanted it and not explained WHY they should get it... which infuriates me. They kind of just tell them that it wont do anything beneficial for THEM. 
12767,"What the other poster said, plus it's the anatomy of the teenage cervix that makes teens most at risk of contracting HPV. "
12768,"It's not a cost thing, although that's a reasonable line of thought. The vaccine only protects you against strains that you haven't yet been exposed to. The thinking was that by that age you've probably already had a few partners and have been exposed to most or all strains, so it would no longer be effective enough to be worth getting. This is also why it's better to vaccinate your kids earlier. Even if you don't think that they're sexually active, they might be, and it's important to protect them and their future partners against cancer."
12769,I think it’s actually 50 in Australia. That’s the higher end of the age bracket they tested anyway.
12770,When did Australia change their stance? I was considered too old back when I was 20 or something (it was only for teens then). 
12771,"There is no cut off age but you can only get it up till 40-45, how does that work?"
12772,"Yes, but there are so many strains and you may or may not have come into contact with one that increases the risk of cervical cancer. Chances are it’ll still provide some benefit even if you’ve been sexually active for years. Also it’s passed via touch (skin to skin contact). So actually you could get it even if you’re not sexually active or if you’ve just felt someone up. So getting it before you have sex isn’t a guarantee either."
12773,"That was an insincere argument, since the vaccines protect your from more than 7 strains. How likely is it to be infected by all 7 after just one partner? Pretty unlikely. And even after 10 different partners it's still pretty unlikely to have been infected by all of them.

It was just the insurances trying to safe costs.

Another thing was not vaccinating men. Like wtf? How do you think most heterosexual women do get infected?

Who comes up with the idea to only vaccinate 50% of the population instead of going for 100% and herd immunity.

That's like letting typhoid Mary run around freely while only trying to vaccinate the people she cooks for."
12774,"> depending on the type of vaccine you got not all the strains are covered

That's not dependent on what vaccine you get. There are no HPV shots that cover *all* strains."
12775,Also about 10% of cases of cervical cancer aren't caused by the HPV virus (according to my obgyn).
12776,"Also, HPV is not the only cause of cervical cancer."
12777,You also need to get them before being exposed to the virus (ie by sexual activity). May have been the case with OP. 
12778,"Same my grandma actually had it too, spread to her lungs and she died. But if it’s any reassurance, your body will get rid of the HPV. Now that I’m in a long term relationship I’m testing negative for HPV and my paps have started to turn around from moderate to mild (fingers crossed). I swear if we didn’t want babies I’d voluntarily have all of it removed, it’s been nothing but problems for years now. Not to mention all these biopsies are so expensive😑"
12779,"If you have a family history of cancer, especially cervical cancer, you’re at a higher risk so you know, make sure to go to your annual exam!"
12780,Just get your exam every year. The precancer can be removed in time if it hasn't been long since your last check. It's a slow growing cancer. 
12781,Having HPV doesn't mean you will *definitely* get cervical cancer - it's a bit like how not everyone who smokes gets lung cancer. 
12782,Get a Dr. that you have a good working relationship with. Make sure they know your family history. Early detection is the key. I had a LEEP this year. It was my second one in 20 years.  
12783,"I’m sorry to hear that. It really is such a pain in the ass. I’m grateful that so far my biopsies have turned out to be mild, but I dread going in every 6 months just to hear that it’s abnormal again. I hope your situation resolves itself without any major issues!"
12784,Awesome!!!! That is great news!!
12785,I’m sure that was a huge relief for you!!! And congrats on your pregnancy:)
12786,"The vaccine is to prevent against several strains of HPV. Some strains of HPV (specifically the ones we vaccinate against) can cause cervical cancer. Cervical cancer can develop without HPV, but HPV is a major cause of cervical cancer, so with the vaccine you'd be at a much lower risk."
12787,"As other have said, the older gardasil vaccine protected against fewer strains of the virus.. I got my shots back around 2007ish so I’m sure it was the old version. But regardless of which vaccine you get, please still go in for your regular Pap smears just to be sure everything’s normal in there!"
12788,I’m sorry you had to deal with all of that! But yesssss seriously I don’t think women understand how very important they are. Just a minute or two of discomfort is so worth it
12789,"I’ve been on a every 6 month pap schedule for a few years now due to the abnormal cells, but I think even if I was testing normally my doc would still have me come in once a year.. it might vary by state, doctor or age group. I’d check with your doc. I know at least for me, my insurance covers one per year so if it’s free I’d say you might as well get it done for the peace of mind!"
12790,"Oh my gosh I am so sorry!! I hope they got it all and no further surgery is needed. Like you, I haven’t had babies yet so I’m sure that adds a whole extra level of stress and worry. I will keep my fingers crossed for you that your procedure went well and you are now cancer free!🙏🏼"
12791,Can I ask - did your doc recommend hysterectomy / is your insurance company ok with it? I’ve seriously considered asking for one after children so that I can finally stop worrying about all this but I’m not sure how that works if it’s voluntary.
12792,Ugh I’m sorry:( I know how frustrating and scary it can be. I hope your paps normalize soon if they haven’t already!
12793,"Yeah, hindsight is a bitch"
12794,"As a gay male, is it worth it for me to get the vaccine? "
12795,I got a prescription for it because of a tumour liked caused by HPV but insurance won’t cover it because I am male.  Canadian too and our provincial coverage doesn’t cover it either
12796,"Yup. I hated shots when I was younger so I refused any ""optional"" vaccines until my mom finally convinced me to get it. I'm glad I did."
12797,My school refused to offer it to boys when we did it in year 8 (12-13yo). It’s the only regular (non-tropical) vaccine I don’t have. I might ask my GP if I can get it.
12798,"The CDC disagrees with you:

>How long does vaccine protection last?

>Research suggests that vaccine protection is long-lasting. Current studies have followed vaccinated individuals for ten years, and show that there is no evidence of weakened protection over time.

https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm"
12799,"Exactly this! Even if you are both virgins, he could be unfaithful. Or he could be lying about his virgin status if he believes that’s what you want to hear. "
12800,"I’m working on it, I promise! I’m fandangaling with insurance currently!"
12801,Awesome. Good on your parents/grandfather. No one can predict the future. 💕💕
12802,"I was too old for the HPV vaccine when it finally came out, but my mum wouldn't let my sister get it because, and I quote, ""cervical cancer is gods punishment for sleeping around. Your sisters not going to do that so she wont need it.""

Thus started the biggest fight I have ever had with my mother. "
12803,Yuuuuuup. My sister most likely has issues that she should be seeing a gyno for but she believes my mom when she says that only married women need to go to the gynecologist no matter what issue they’re having. 🙄🙄🙄 
12804,Yes!! Some insurance companies put a limit on the age at which they will provide it. My insurance said 26 but I think every insurance company is different. So check with your doctor and insurance! 
12805,"You can be socially/financially  conservative while still believing in science. 

Being conservative and a fundamentalist idiot are different things. I'm getting really tired of them being used interchangeably. "
12806,So my doctor said that if I haven’t already been exposed then I won’t get exposed if my relationship stays monogamous (but she said that me having been sexually active before getting the vaccine meant I probably already had it :/ ) . I love and trust my fiancé completely but I always hope for the best and prepare for the worst (just like STI testing every year) so I got it. I think the doctor should be encouraging every woman to get it but it’s rural Alabama and this lady is the first GYN to not slut shame me so 🤷‍♀️
12807,"Because you might not be forever because he might cheat, because rape is still a thing... just off the top of my head."
12808,Because you might not always be in a monogamous relationship?
12809,"There are several good reasons. As much as you trust your partner you aren't omniscient and cheating does frequently happen.

Also your partner may have had a different definition of what sex entails and might have received/given a blowjob and not considered that sex.

Also you might divorce your partner and get a new one.

And all the possible reasons of getting infected through non sexual means, which while very unlikely is possible. HPV can spread through toilet seats for example if someone with genital warts touches it. The virus doesn't stay alive long, but if the person 10 seconds before you contaminated the seat you can get infected."
12810,Bc you can still get it. 
12811,"Let us say your partner has been in a monogamous relationship before, not unheard of yes? Or from the ""conservative Christian"" standpoint let's say you have a partner who found god late in life (apparently Jesus came to save sinners). If your monogamous partner had any kind of sex (even oral) with their previous partner(s) and that/those partner who at some point had oral sex with someone else then you become joined to that infection network. This is bad because HPV has so few visible symptoms it is unlikely that anyone in that network is aware that they are infected. Monogamy reduces the risk, but it does not eliminate it. This is not even science, it's common sense."
12812,"Nobody plans to go out and come into contact with polio.

Nobody plans to get raped.

Vaccines are for unforeseen events."
12813,My mom is pro-vax but she definitely thinks microwaves and plastic cause all the cancer. She puts wax paper inside of plastic bags so it won’t touch the food.
12814,I don't think there is a real age limit. The idea of vaccinating kids is because they are (theoretically) not sexually active. Papillomaviruses are relatively common and you might be exposed as soon as you become sexually active. And vaccines in general are best before you get exposed to the virus.
12815,"I will.  Thanks!!  I figure might as well (despite testing negative - that’s some luck right there - despite practicing safe sex, yes) because why the heck not??  Congrats on getting vaccinated!  My little bro and his wife apparently got into a huge argument because she started talking crazy about vaccines.  He’s a medical school student and she used to be a paramedic and is in PA school, so no idea what she was thinking... but he quashed that real fast and got all of his kids vaccinated for “everything.”

Ok, tangent over.  Thanks!"
12816,"Only a lower limit afaik (i think upper limit is like 60-70 depending on your health), but 30-40 should still be ok to get it (only elderly or children may have trouble coping with the vaccine)

Im no expert so i may be off on that"
12817,"There are various age limits that are based on financial reasons and not scientific medical reasons.

Since the latest vaccine covers 9 different strains it's extremely unlikely to have been infected by all 9 already, thus even if you already had 8 of them, it still is a benefit.

In the beginning with the 2 strain vaccine it used to be even worse, only covered for women or rather girls under 17, no matter whether you were a virgin or not and not for men. (for not reason at all, even if men don't get cervical cancer they can still get all the other cancers HPV causes and genital warts even with gay sex in addition to spreading the virus to unvaccinated women)."
12818,That’s interesting to know! How are you doing now? I know my gf gets really stressed out now before her physicals or OBGYN. I do my best to just be here for her. 
12819,"*most than none!

Do you know which vaccine you received? The Gardasil 4 or 9? Both vaccines protect you from 70% and 90% of cervical cancer causing strains respectively. Good job OP!"
12820,"> Even at 14, they are still kids and shouldn't be thinking about hpv.

Plenty of fourteen year olds are sexually active, and plenty others have been or will be sexually assaulted. "
12821,Just like to add that pharmacists can administer it in many states so it can maybe save you an appointment :)
12822,"Eh, sometimes the parents are too demanding and when you hit 18 you’re technically free from their grasp. "
12823,"In the US, it depends on the state. In my state my kids can seek medical care on their own at 14 and doctor's can only share with me what the patient wants to share. However, if a child who is old enough to see care on their own is still on their parents medical insurance, mom and dad will get the medical bill and find out anyway. 

So they can, but not privately once the bill comes."
12824,I was fairly sure appointments with doctors can be confidential after 14 in some states? Billing/copay might be a thing but...ask if they're ok waiting until the last shot?
12825,"I don't know about the HPV vaccine, but most states allow minors to access certain health services without parental involvement, like birth control and prenatal care.

Considering that teens are exceptionally likely to engage in some sort of sexual activity before they reach 18, thus risking exposure to HPV, no, waiting til you're 18 to be vaccinated is a terrible idea. There's no point to the vaccine *after* you've been exposed. 

And you *are* playing devil's advocate, so that was a weird start to your comment. "
12839,">If you've already been exposed to HPV

But I wouldn't be if I've only had sex with girls who've had the vaccine right? That was my question. "
12840,Controller should be “controlled”
12841,"Some of the smartest people I've met are extremely religious, and some of the most braindead individuals I've met are also extremely religious. The fact that someone adheres to a religion is not a blanket statement for why they shouldn't be in science or should not be allowed to practice; it's only when they let their religious views overshadow fundamental basic logic or widely accepted and understood practices that religion becomes problematic. Let people believe what they want about existence, so long as it doesn't endanger others or hinder their ability to do their job correctly.

Obviously in this case, the doctor should no longer be allowed to practice, but I'm sure multitudes of other religious doctors would also disparage him for his actions. It's not religion thats the issue, it's the fact that certain individuals who are just blatantly incompetent are somehow still allowed to practice."
12842,"Considering half of my Orthodox Jewish family are doctors, I'd say no, being religious is definitely not a barrier to being a good doctor in any way shape or form, unless you choose to make it so. My mother is universally adored by her patients."
12843,"Religion and science/medicine/critical thinking are not mutually exclusive.  While I grant you there are some people that use religion as a shield against scientific fact, there are many even very strict religious individuals who believe both can exist without nullifying each other.  The whole theory of intelligent design is essentially predicated on this concept, after all what could be more divinely inspired than a system of life that is self adaptable to meet changing conditions and can be explained in a logical fashion?"
12844,"We have a GP I work with who's super religious and works at a practice that has a Chapel service too. He's open minded, treats a lot of drug users and sex workers, and genuinely cares about his patients. Just religion is taken the wrong way by some religious folks seems to be the issue above"
12845,"It's fine to be a doctor if you're super religious, just so long as your religious beliefs do not affect how you treat your patients. It's when they tell you that ""oral sex is abusive"" or that ""only bad girls need the HPV vaccine"", endangering both their patients and the general public, that they need to have their medical license revoked. "
12846,"There’s a difference between being religious and being extremist. 

Life advice does not equal medical advice. A doctor can give their opinion on how to live your life (albeit very unprofessional) as long as that doesn’t affect their ability to administer the appropriate medical care based on the patients needs. "
12847,"It's weird. Doctors are STEM, but I think their superior social status leads them into being extremely conservative a lot of the time. 

Like, my dad literally has an advanced degree in a field of science. But he still denies climate change."
12848,"Freedom of belief applies to doctors as well.
My friend was laughing his ass off telling me stories about a guy who was studying with him in medical university. He was super religious too up to point that he couldnt pronounce word ""vagina"". Both students and proffessors had tons of fun throwing jokes and trap questions that involve those no-no words watching him go red and almost faint one time. 
And all jokes aside he graduated this year. "
12849,">I dont see how somebody can be a doctor who super religious.

Something about healing and caring for people?

The problem is when they step outside their area of expertise in healing and care. Like not understanding the psychological impacts of certain things. Or, when their medical advice is *technically* correct, but doesn't address the patient's needs. If I'm not mistaken, if OP were to remain a virgin they wouldn't *need* the vaccine."
12850,If he's still practicing there could definitely still be consequences. Advising patients to make medical decisions based on how they think Jesus feels certainly sounds complaint-worthy to me. I doubt someone would stop doing that so the physician has likely compromised the care of many people. 
12851,"If he's still practicing and you feel it would help you get closure or make you feel better, then do it! A lot of time a single complaint can open up the floodgates because if he said things like that to you, he likely said similar things to countless other people. Worst case scenario nothing happens but at least it's out of your hands and you know you tried to have him held accountable. "
12852,There's no way he's not saying dumb shit like that on a daily basis still.
12853,"Even if there’s a statute of limitations on it, it’ll still make him look bad, I say it’s worth it "
12854,"Tell him that before appendectomies, people just had to let that shit pop, and pray God gave their body the ability to fight off sepsis. As a matter of fact, your bodies ability to fight off that self destructing organ is directly related to how much God loves you.

12869,"The thing is not that leeches are not medically relevant. It is that people in the past use leeches for the wrong reason, wrong problem because they have no clue how the body actually works. Is bloodletting a stupid treatment? Yes, if you use it for every ailment under the sun but if you have a hemorrhage under your skull, your doctor better let out the blood or you are going to die. "

12877,"There's absolutely no reason to set an age limit for that vaccine, they're basically saying ""you've been exposed to dick by now so there's no point"" 

It's like that same shit logic policies that ban gay men and transwomen from donating blood."

12879,"Can't you sue them and get them to pay for treatment? There has to be records of you asking to get the vaccine and being denied even though you weren't 26 yet. I'm not that familiar with US laws, but might be worth at least posting to legaladvice, to get some perspective from people who actually know what they're talking about."
12880,Planned Parenthood gave me the vax when I was in my late 30s a few years ago.
12881,"I was at a doctor's office in Canada (with my Mom) and there was a pamphlet that mentioned the change. I went back to my doctor in the US and asked him about it, and he confirmed what the pamphlet said, that it was now recommended for women up to 40. It was covered by my insurance."
12882,"I'm posting this from another comment: There is no cutoff age. It makes absolutely no sense that you can get ""too old"" for a vaccine to work. The vaccine was considered expensive by American insurers, and so they lobbied the FDA to put an age recommendation on the vaccine so that they could deny coverage. I pushed my doctor on it, and she admitted that the age restriction was BS and that even in my 30s I would see a benefit from getting it. I had to demand the vaccine, and pay it out of pocket, but I was able to get it.

Look it up. Countries like Australia tell people to get it up to age 45.

12884,"It was in the U.S. I had pretty fantastic insurance at the time, though, which I no longer do. Not sure if the one I have now would cover it."
12885,I got my shot even though I was over 26.
12886,"When I asked my doctor about it, he said that there were two reasons why they had a certain age limit. The first was that they recommended the vaccine prior to the time you were likely to become sexually active, since that's when you get your exposure. The second was, because of this, they may have originally only tested the vaccine on younger people, and have expanded the testing since then.

Your risk is related to exposure, which is related to sexual partners, rather than age. They're just assuming you'll have fewer sexual partners as you age."
12887,"My insurance did even though I was over 26, but I had fantastic insurance at the time. Now, not so much. I'm not sure if my insurance now would."
12888,"I posted some sources in another comment. Exposure was used as an excuse, but the vaccine still works against other strains. I’ve also read articles that have said there is emerging research suggesting that the vaccine may help your immune system keep strains you already have suppressed.

I’m on my phone and being lazy, but this is one of the articles popping up in a cursory google search:

https://www.fredhutch.org/en/news/center-news/2016/08/hpv-vaccine-boosts-immune-memory.amp.html"
12889,Yes it was bad reasoning that caused a lot of people to get cancer and delayed the eradication of HPV another 15 years.  I am furious about it.
12890,"I thought it was because they hadn't tested the vaccine on populations aged 26+, or if they had, then they found it to not be as effective as in younger populations. The BCG vaccine (for tuberculosis) is like that - it is most effective in younger people and is not really worth giving to adults unless they're acutely at risk. 

Edit: I just reread the comment you responded to... I feel kind of stupid. But I had heard that you *can* age out of vaccine effectiveness like the TB vaccine I mentioned above. If it worked effectively I feel like they would just give it to those of us who work in health care instead of making us get eternal PPDs (tuberculosis skin tests). I would gladly get a vaccine to avoid all of that headache, I think it just doesn't work. Not really sure why because like the poster above, it doesn't really make sense to me either. Either way, I'm glad they expanded the age of the HPV vaccine. "
12891,"The thing is, vaccines can still reduce severity of symptoms after infection and boost immunity to reoccurrences in addition to it being unlikely to even be infected by all of the strains the vaccine protects again.

And even if it would be based on number of sexual encounters with different persons. If you are a virgin it's pretty unlikely that you've been infected. So even if it were the case that by the age of 26 you have had most strains, a simple are you a virgin would make sure that vaccine is still useful even if you are 65."
12892,"That's exactly what it was. But, the cost to benefit analysis was done on the behalf of American insurers."
12893,"I should specify, when I said there is no real age cut off, I mean that there is no age where he is guaranteed to see no benefit from getting it. Past a certain age his insurance \*will not\* help him pay for it, and many doctors may deny him if he requests it."
12894,"It is a cost thing.   


""The issue comes down to a conflict between minding the health of populations vs. individuals. Federal regulators naturally care about setting policies that represent the most cost-effective way of protecting the overall population. And to be fair, the research has failed to provide evidence that recommending all older women get vaccinated against HPV fits that bill.""

It was most definitely a cost thing. Insurers didn't want to cover it for the entire population, and the FDA thought 26 was a reasonable cutoff point.  


I've linked to articles in several other comments about how the vaccine protects you against strains you don't have, and how research suggests it may help your immune system to keep the strains you do have suppressed.   


I think you're misinformed about the statistics involved in HPV prevalence. There are 40 different strains that are sexually transmitted, out of over 100 strains. Multiple strains cause cancer or warts. The notion that if you've had a few partners by 26 means you have most/all strains of hpv is ludicrous. If that were the case nearly everyone you know would have experienced a case of genital warts. But, when you look up cases of genital wart prevalence only 1% of sexually active people in the US have genital warts, with about 5-8% of 18-59 yo's having experienced it in their lifetime:  


[https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/fulltext/2008/04000/Genital\_Warts\_Among\_18\_\_to\_59\_Year\_Olds\_in\_the.8.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/fulltext/2008/04000/Genital_Warts_Among_18__to_59_Year_Olds_in_the.8.aspx)  


For most sexually active people, they've likely been exposed to 1 or 2 strains by the time they're in their 30s. The latest version of the vaccine guards against 9 different strains."
12895,"It actually does depend on which vaccine you got. Cervarix was only bivalent (protects against HPV 16 and 18), gardasil (original - was quadrivalent protecting against 4 strains), and now gardasil 9 (protects against 9 strains of HPV). "
12896,"There have been multiple versions of the vaccine. The latest one covers a lot more strains than the older versions. Most importantly, it covers the most dangerous strains."
12897,Yes I know that. I meant that the earlier ones only covered 2 strains and the newer ones cover 9
12898,"HPV contributes to penile, throat and mouth cancers. Definitely worth it for a gay male to receive the vaccination. "
12899,"Yes, it can spread male-male. "
12900,Yes!
12901,"Please do. Anal cancer is awful. Also, depending on your age and history, talk to your doctor about anal Paps. Those save lives as well. They are becoming more common, thankfully. I’ve seen men with metastatic anal cancer that might have been prevented by getting regular anal Pap screening, similar to cervical Paps for women."
12902,"Yes. The CDC recommends that mem who have sex with men get the 3 shots anytime up to age 26. They are also likely free with your insurance and you can even get them done at your local pharmacy.

I'd also suggest looking into PrEP if you haven't already done so.  Just know that you will still need to use condoms to help prevent other diseases."
12903,"I remember reading about a possible indication for rectal cancer.

As a fellow gay man you have nothing to lose by getting the shots."
12904,"Yes! HPV causes oral, throat and anal cancer. "
12905,"For the love of god get it, my male family member just caught genital warts. It prevents 90% of them"
12906,"HPV is transmitted via skin-to-skin contact and can cause cancers in the anal/genital region as well as the mouth/throat, so if you're having anal sex, oral sex, or rubbing genitals, you are at risk. Of course we should give it to boys."
12907,"Serious question for an asexual male: do I need it?

^(I already have it. My mother actually got it for me before most places even considered giving it to males. Just curiosity)"
12908,Males are at a much lower risk for developing cancers associated with HPV but it's still a preventable risk. Do it! 
12909,"Don't matter if you're gay, straight, bi, unicorn. Vaccinate."
12910,"It would be same reason for you as for any other male. For men it's mostly to prevent spreading the infection to women. Whether directly or through a bisexual partner.

In addition HPV can also cause cancers in men. The penile version is usually spotted and can be treated well, but throat cancer and rectal is very much a risk, since those are usually spotted very late.

  


In addition to that HPV also causes genital and anal warts. And the 9 strain vaccine protects against 90% of the causal strains.

So you may want the latest version that protects against both many cancers and most warts."
12911,"Hell yes. I’ve worked in cancer hospital and head and neck cancer is possibly the worst thing that can happen to a person. 
It doesn’t work if you’ve already been exposed though (i.e. been sexually active)"
12912,"HPV can cause throat and other cancers for men. Get the shot. According to my Dr., it doesn't just require intercourse to transmit. She said oral would do the trick."
12913,"Not unless you plan on having unprotected sex with a female, or Male partner who will."
12914,"And just FYI- if you pay out of pocket, it still won’t bankrupt you. Much cheaper than cancer. Much cheaper than getting brand name Prilosec "
12915,Thanks! I appreciate hearing your thought process 
12916,"Thanks. Should've been clearer I was asking since I don't have the vaccine. None of the specific scenarios you mentioned apply to me, but still good to point them out "
12917,"Thanks I appreciate the answer. I haven't gotten the vaccine since I'm in a monogamous relationship, but good food for thought"

12922,"You're getting down voted for asking a poorly informed question. New vaccines are being developed all the time. The HPV vaccine was approved in 2006, the ebola vaccine is still being developed, flu vaccines evolve with the flu. That's just a few examples. Regulatory approval is incredibly difficult and time consuming to obtain. Vaccine and drug development is constantly underway but takes a long time to bear fruit."
12923,"I'm sorry your getting down voted. Let me put it to you this way
 
There are people whose cars have fallen in the water (a lake or a river or something) and their seat belt has literally killed them. Would you put information out in the world that said we should not wear seat belts? Or maybe that seat belts are possibly dangerous? Or let's not even take it that far. Let's say you just put out the idea that seat belts aren't as safe as people make them out to be, and you never discourage people from wearing their seat belts 

The problem with this is that your words matter. They may be innocent to you, but a mom out there who loves her kids reads your words and thinks ""wow, I didn't know that about seat belts"" and stops making her kids wear them. 

The chances of falling into a lake are WAY slim compared to the chances of getting into a car accident. It's obvious to us that even suggesting that seat belts are bad is terrible because the possibility of death by an accident is a very real and very common one. 

Vaccines are like that. If you put out on the internet that vaccines *might* be dangerous, a mom will read your words and ""to be on the safe side"" won't vaccinate her kids. If that mother's kid dies, what's your level or responsibility here? Do you even want to have one? So why would you say something so dangerous like what you just said? At the very least, I hope you understand the down votes"
12924,"Because idiots will choose to not get vaccinated based on that line of thinking. Of course they need to continue to be researched but the ones who question the safety of vaccines tell their friends family not to get vaccines and don’t vaccinate themselves or their kids. 

If a vaccine causes 5 deaths but saves 1,000,000 lives, then it’s silly to avoid the vaccine. "
12925,"You probably got downvoted because you look like you're soft balling the question as a manipulation tactic. It's common in pretty much any debate where someone is against a thing. 

To your point, of course we need to develop better vaccines, but we do that regularly, both in vitro and using information about how it's functioning in vivo. 

Getting people vaccinated is a much more important thing to be vocal about imo."
12926,[deleted]
12927,"Downvotes rained upon you because there are way too many people “questioning” which causes kids to LITERALLY DIE. If some mom decides she wants to withhold a vaccine until ‘more information comes out’ and then her kid contracts whooping cough, that kid then infects kids who cannot (because of actual legitimate science-based reasons like kids with organ transplants, cystic fibrosis or newborns) be vaccinated. That’s why people freak out when someone says, “I only asked a question.” People do suck, but those people are anti-vaxxers."
12928,"Hey don’t feel bad, I think maybe it is easy to interpret questions about vaccines as questioning vaccines. Your tone kinda made it sort of unclear how deep you were going"

But oh well. We clearly should be allowing our children to get cervical cancer, one of the most easily preventable cancers, just because some quack decided vaccines are bad for us. "

-  making the word “socialized“ a pejorative 

- keeping real costs hidden through employers

- Conflating quality of healthcare with healthcare delivery system

- A large part of America still believing that free market healthcare delivery is efficient

- Individuals not wanting to pay for other people's poor healthcare choices without acknowledging that they already are. 

The US Health insurance system breaks the primary tenants of free markets:

- Limited supply and virtually unlimited demand

- Restricted movement By individuals within the system

- non-perfect information sharing. The insurance companies hold all the cards. 

You can have a robust free market secondary health care market once primary care is covered (emergency, under 18, preventative, regular checkups, specialized care). 

The US is sitting on what is most likely the greatest risk pool in history of 320 million relatively healthy people and A large portion of people believe that the best way to deliver an expensive healthcare is by segmenting that risk pool into high risk pools, low risk pools, this that and the other? People simply don't understand that their healthcare costs would drop at bare minimum 30 to 35% almost overnight and long-term much more than that. 

A system that allows a citizen to lose their home or their retirement or their children's education due to an unexpected health event?  Rotten to the core. Selfish individualism run amok. ""I got mine! Now how do I make money off of you trying to get yours""

The rest of the world has shown a basis for what actually works and why US citizens continue to fight against their own best interest just shows how willing they are to have their pockets picked as long as they are tossed a few nationalistic platitudes like ""freedom!""

Now also just watch. The absurd text break that was passed, they knew were going to provide short-term gains but we're also going to blow up the budget deficit this is a feature not a bug. They want to get their hands on the cash that flows through SS and Medicare. Republican simply cannot stand that No one is making money off ofthe hundreds of billions of dollars that flow through these systems. Here comes the privatization train. And it is going to be one enormous grift.

12959,Most reasonable people in the US agree with you.
12960,It is but conservatives have been convinced that Canada’s system is awful and ours would be great again if we could reverse everything Obama did to fuck it up. It makes me angry thinking about it.
12961,"Please make sure you tell everyone you know.

As far as I can tell, just about every conservatives seems to have a Canadian friend who moved to the US because of the nightmare of socialized medicine. 
"
12962,"A few years ago I was getting the set when I was 25, turning 26, and planned parenthood cancelled my 3rd shot appt because it was ""too early"" in their system (by 2 days)(when that was literally the only day I could make it there to get it) and then wouldn't give me the shot at a later date because then I was too old and I also lost my insurance. "
12963,How much was it at PP?
12964,That planned parenthood is badass. Not all of them do that.
12965,This is so good to know. I'm about to turn 27 and was just thinking of asking my doctor about it.
12966,"The only possible reason why you'd not need the vaccine anymore would be if you had already been infected by every single on of the strains the vaccine protects against.

And this only if there were no benefit for vaccinating after infection, which is not generally true.

So the age cut off makes no sense. And it's especially unlikely for most people to get infected with all the different strains during their lifetimes."
12967,"It’s not about being too old, it’s just more effective in those that haven’t been exposed to HPV before. So sexually active young women and older women have potentially been exposed and therefore the vaccine would potentially be less effective. I think that’s what the logic is behind the age restrictions that were first implemented! "
12968,How much was the vaccine?
12969,"This is true, the new ones are better, but there are more than 9 strains of HPV. "
12970,"They said ""Depending on the type of vaccine you got, not all strains are covered."" Not all strains being covered is NOT dependent on the kind of vaccine they get. Not all strains are covered, period."
12971,When did gardasil 9 hit? I got the vaccine in 2014 (since my mom didn’t let me get “the vaccine for promiscuous girls” when it was recommended at 16.)
12972,"Oh hey, gardasil is the one I just got."
12973,Anal too
12974,"Also responsible for 95% of all anal cancers

12975,"Does the vaccine still have the declining efficacy after a certain age? It became a thing when I was around 22, and doctors said there wasn’t really a point in getting it because at that age it basically ineffective vs when you’re a teenager. Is this still the case? "
12976,and anal cancer.  EVERYONE should get the vaccine.  
12977,Hmm... My Catholic school said that bots don't need it *unless* you're gay. I guess that's what made me gay. ^/s
12978,And warts. Don’t forget warts.
12979,It also causes colon cancer. It causes cancer pretty much everywhere it comes in contact with mucus membranes. Fun!
12980,"Right, and he could give it to a bisexual male who could give it to a women also. "
12981,"The vaccine protects both females and males from the strains of HPV that cause cervical and penile cancer, respectively.  It’s also likely to be protective for HPV-caused head-and-neck cancer, and rectal cancer.  Sexual orientation does not contraindicate use of the vaccine."
12982,[removed]
12983,"Let us know how it goes, I think it's a series of several shots, right?"
12984,Omg did this scrub actually say that? What the hell?
12985,"A desire to practice safe sex is great and all, but sexual assault is a thing and all too common. Not to mention that teens are not known for making great decisions. "
12986,"Please don't share that opinion with anyone. It's dangerous thinking like that. Doctors aren't giving the shots to infants, it's to 14-16 year olds. By that age it's safe.

Overhauling an out of date, obsolete education that talks about the risks of sex is much harder to enforce than nation wide vaccination, especially in regions where talking about sex is taboo.

Also, when have teens as a group ever listened? Especially about sex? Think back to when you were in highschool, and the stories that were floating around, or your classes reactions to sex ed. No matter how good your education is, it's gonna happen. Teaching abstinence is useless. Just look at the chlamydia stats in the US.

Stop spreading the idea they're dangerous to get when you get it too young. The government in Canada and other places start the vaccinations at the right age. The risks are minimal, and the reward is a ton less cancer. 

Birth control has worse side effects than a vaccine. Getting HPV definitely has worse side effects of the vaccine. Getting cervical cancer and dying prematurely is definitely more dangerous than any side effect that you could possibly getting the vaccine at the age when it's recommended."
12987,">  unless you have a different definition of ""virgin"" than I do

That was a poor word choice on my part, a more appropriate thing would have been ""if OP has no sexual encounters"".


"
12988,"Weed is great - but isn’t perfect everywhere. Like taking a pill at work is way easier than smoking a joint. Especially if you have the Xanax in an Advil bottle.  :p

I used to be prescribed Xanax a lot (6mg/day) - haven’t had a script in years but I managed to save a few when I was reducing just for rare use now and then :)"
12989,:D cheers! Or whatever the appropriate term is :p
12990,"Yeahhhh. And various strains can have shockingly different effects, too "
12991,"
I'm not spiritual myself but this is definitely bad practice from a doctor.

I'm sure having a spiritual practice can guide you through anxiety but it won't necessarily make it go away. I have really bad panic attacks and I can see relying on faith/spirituality to help you through them. Its actually  recommended in the DARE book I read to curing panic attacks. 

"
12992,The doctor was not practicing good medicine. Prescription for Jesus? Piss off 
12993,"Maggots, too - it freaks me out but I guess some things just do the job best"
12994,Care to elaborate? Genuinely curious
12995,The misinformation is really out of control. I constantly have to correct Americans about how the Canadian system works.
12996,"Oh I know. I have conservative family living in the U.S. and they tell my still-living-in-Canada family what the Canadian system is like (as they've heard from Fox News) and no matter how much we tell them it isn't like that, they refuse to believe us. It is downright insane."
12997,"Some shots unfortunately don't have a grace period and can't be given early. I can't remember if HPV is one of them, but it's pretty strict about them. That's just bad luck all around, though."
12998,"If it makes you feel better, my doctor told me the 3rd shot was kinda ""optional"".  I had the same thing happen, got my first a little before 25, missed the window to get the 3rd and didn't want to dish the hundreds of dollars to get it off insurance."
12999,Planned Parenthood wouldn't treat you without insurance? That sounds... like the opposite thing they exist to do. 
13000,"Except your risk for being exposed has more to do with your sexual history than your age. A 30 yo virgin has less chance of exposure than a sexually active highschool student. But nonetheless, a 30 year old in the US has to fight to get the vaccine, regardless of their history.

Also, the vaccine still protects you from strains you don’t have, and may even help your immune system to suppress the strains you do have. So, even exposure isn’t an excuse not to get it. 

I got it *because* I had dysplasia, and after pressing my doctor about information on what I could do *she* told me that the vaccine might help my immune system clear the hpv keep it suppressed. After getting the vaccine my dysplasia went away. That’s not necessarily due to the vaccine (it may have been a coincidence), but at this point I’ve read articles and spoken to multiple doctors who’ve all told me the vaccine may have helped my body clear it. And regardless, I’m still protected against the strains I don’t have.

It really is a lobbying issue, where the insurers didn’t want to pay for an expensive vaccine. The result of that is that millions of women were ill-informed about an important vaccine, and many believe they can be “too old” to receive it."
13001,"That’s why we get yearly Pap smears- to see if we’ve been exposed to any hpv strains. When your Pap smear is positive, it means you’ve been exposed to some strain (usually a benign strain that your body eliminates itself). 

So, as a 32 year old woman who has never been exposed to one of the 3 cancer causing hpv strains (I know this bc I’ve had normal Pap smears since I was 16yo), *why can’t I get the hpv vaccine?*

"
13002,"I was on a financial aid payment plan with the hospital to help cover expenses from regular cancer screening, so it was added to that and discounted. I believe they initially quoted me around $300 total."
13003,You are correct. There are over a hundred. Just wanted to point out that different vaccines protect against fewer strains.  I think only gardasil 9 is being offered now. They all protect against the most likely culprits 16 and 18 though. 
13004,The ones covered are the most dangerous ones.
13005,"On the flip side, not all strains cause cervical cancer either."
13006,They meant to say depending on the vaccine you got not all strains that are possible to vaccinate against may be covered.
13007,"I did not realize it caused more than cervical cancer. I stand corrected. 

Edit: Thank you for informing, instead of just angrily mashing downvote. You are a credit to the species."
13008,"Not rectal cancer, but anal cancer. Oropharyngeal, vaginal, vulvar, cervical, penile and anal cancers. 

There are some 40+ strains of HPV and the vaccines only protect against certain strains. The major causes of cancer are 16 and 18. Other strains cause warts, but do not cause cancer. Others do not cause anything at all. If you have been sexually active at some point in your life you have likely been exposed. This is why the vaccine is aimed at younger people given that they likely have not had sexual contact and are immunologically naive to the virus. If your body has already built up and immune response, the vaccine is less effective.

13009,Gay males were actually advised to get the shot before it was even recommended for boys (in my country anyway). 
13010,"Penile cancer is incredible rare though, is it not?"

13012,Always read comment history.  Throwing people’s words back in their face when contextually relevant helps to get their attention.
13013,"Yeah, my last job was working for the federal government who 100% would not be cool with anyone partaking at work."
13014,6mg a day is a lot. Wow! I am allowed .5mg as needed right now but I am on a handful of other anxiety/depression/Bipolar 2 meds as well.
13015,Cheers works!  Or “have a good trip”?  Lol
13016,They only consume dead tissue and leave the healthy tissue alone. Gross but efficient.
13017,"Yup! Medical maggots don't turn into flies, and are really good at clearing away rotting tissue and leaving healthy tissue. "
13018,"I remember hearing something about maggots only eating dead flesh. 

So they eat the bad and leave the good to heal."
13019,"The maggots thing is pretty wild, but if you really think about it its an artful solution to a serious problem.  They basically let you remove necrotic flesh without cutting away healthy flesh in the process."
13020,"Yeah, had they said that and not scheduled me for it, only to cancel the day of, citing this, in a voicemail, I probably wouldn't be as bitter about it. :/ I had that appt booked for months so I could take a long lunch at work and use some pto to make it happen. "
13021,I don't know about the older hpv vaccine but I know the Gardasil9 has no leeway for doing it sooner. You can do it as much after the day as you want but not before.
13022,That makes me feel waaaaaaay better! Thank you! 
13023,"I have read that there has been research in the US about the overall opinion of the importance of the HPV vaccine in the other 25s (I got it from Pudmed). It showed that women can see the importance in its use. 

As you said it’s an issue with insurance and money. In the UK (where I’m from) the vaccine is given in waves to school age children and I was lucky enough to be the first batch of teenage girls to get it. 

I know that if individuals would want to get the vaccine and are under the age of 44 they can pay £155 per shot to be vaccinated at Boots (a local drug store). This isn’t unusual in the UK as non-routine adult vaccines do require you to purchase them yourself (e.g. yellow fever vaccine when going abroad). "
13024,"I think you definitely have a point. When they first started the administering the vaccine I can understand why they limited it. It made sense to not give it to people who may have been potentially exposed to HPV. But I think the research about the virus has furthered understanding and I don’t see why you shouldn’t be entitled to it. In the UK Pap smears are not until we’re 25 so targeting the younger demographic who are perceived to be low risk makes sense. 

Hopefully the medical guidelines will change. "
13025,"The vast majority of HPV strains have no known effect at all on humans. Gardasil protects against the most common causes of cervical cancer, the most common causes of genital warts, and several other high risk strains. There still are strains that are of slight concern unprotected by the vaccine, but overall it's an extremely effective vaccine."
13026,"I had gardasil back in 2007/8 when it only protected against 4 stains of hpv. 

Is it possible to get the gardasil 9 vaccine now for people who already had the original?"
13027,"Gardasil 9 has 9 strains that are the most common for both high and low risk, but IIRC it has 4 high risk and 5 low risk? There are more than 4 high-risk (cancer causing) variants, I believe the tests that were performed with my PAP had 11 or 13 high risk strains it tested for. There are believed to be between 100-200+ strains overall. "
13028,"I know, and it's great they do! I got the shot and I'm all for it. It's just important that people still get their paps and don't suddenly think ""I'm safe from cervical cancer forever""."
13029,You're the hero we need but don't deserve
13030,Yeahhh. I’ve gotten talked to at a couple jobs and apparently people would complain I smelled of marijuana. But I usually quit and moved somewhere more accepting when that happened - now I work in the marijuana industry- NO ONE complains at work anymore! :D
13031,"Yeah, I was also on other benzos, Soma, briefly adderall and some depression/insomnia meds mixed in, at times :p 

0.5mg is a much more reasonable Xanax dose. Withdrawal from that stuff is no joke!!"

13036,"Pssst... it's your friendly neighborhood Coloradan here with a pro tip for you, /u/SilentG33, and anyone else with this problem:

_Vape pens._ 

I'm not talking about the big clunky vapes that a lot of kids tote around and fill with flavored tobacco juice. I'm talking about the small, discreet ones (like [OpenVape](https://openvapeshop.com/) or [Evolabs](https://www.evolab.com/)) that take CO2 oil cartridges.
Take one into the stairwell (or a bathroom stall if you're right under the air intake) and puff there. While it's true that someone nearby could still _see_ the vapor, it dissipates very quickly and leaves no noticeable odor or residue in the room or on your person, so if you're careful to do it when you're out of sight it's basically undetectable. If you invest in a refillable cartridge it's actually a very cost-effective way to consume.

You're in the industry now so you probably know all this – but for others who may be up against this issue, this is the solution that worked for me."
13037,"Oh hello yeah! I love cooking/food, too. And have done this for entire meals - it would be awesome to do it as an entire restaurant:D"
13038,"Haha. That’s totally possible- you know, if I ever don’t smell like weed :p"
13039,"Vape pens work great, as do the tincture drops of oil!"
13040,"The amount of ""omg did I get HIV"" posts are TOO DAMN HIGH!"

13042,People are just looking for reassurances after mistakes.
13043,"OP great post, all I would like to add is that the HPV vaccine is still effective and recommended for people even if they have been exposed to HPV. There are over 30 different strains of the virus and the vaccine protects against more than half of them as well as bolstering immunity for a string that someone may already be infected with."

If you had anal (passive) or vaginal intercourse with someone who may be HIV+ and not properly medicated, make sure you get PeP, the sooner the better.
If eg that person is HIV+ and properly medicated, there is no statistical measurable risk.

Concerning PreP: I still suggest to use condoms, because they lower the risk of transmission of other STDs.
But I grew up when using condoms was a no brainer because the people who didn’t were dying. Can’t re-educate myself, maybe it’s just envy :)"
13056,"Honnestly, I feel like this generation (in Canada at least) has suffered greatly from the cutbacks in sex-ed. I worked in a STI screening clinic in the LGBT community for a while and the amount of ""I kissed a guy at the bar I want to get screened for AIDS"" was just ridiculous "

13065,"In all sincerity:

What you are forgetting [kyzursosay](https://www.reddit.com/user/kyzursosay) is that humans are fallible. Some are lonely. Some are isolated. Some are blind-horny. Some give up their responsibility by having sex while drunk or high. Getting up in it with your righteousness isn't going to change that.  If that were the case, the AIDS crisis would have stopped. By the mid 1980s, scientists discovered the virus and transmission methods. Later \[what seemed like a lifetime to live through\], a test existed to detect antibodies of HIV.

People, including myself, have been angry, confused, saddened, dumbfounded that infection rates continued to rise (or even stayed level) ever since. The best minds in the world have tried to reduce infection rates. The hard facts, the preaching, the admonishment, the shaming did little to significantly change infection rates.

Humans are not machines. They have passion, lust, confusion, and addictions, to name a few. Humans are living contradictions, ~~living~~ ~~in~~ inhabiting a world where opposites are both true. Humans often learn from mistakes. I don't know that bringing the change in HIV prevention messaging from scientific to more sociological, culturally-appropriate, communication has changed infection rates. HIV has exploited something more than the human immune system. It has adapted to the human condition of being fallible.

Fine to vent. Great to provide resources. The world needs your passion and fire. And it also needs your compassion and forgiveness. Your gay brothers especially need all those qualities. I'm a little concerned that all the resources you provided were lost in the tone. Thanks for posting either way.

13066,"And the amount of people who respond with ""there's always a chance"" or whatever only make it worse.

13078,"Most adults don't.

Sex Ed is bad. Stigmas spread lies and misinformation.

Unless you are celibate you are pretty much guaranteed to catch something, whether you ever find out or not.

The vast majority of the sexually active population has herpes and/or HPV.

There is not an HPV test for men. The vaccine only protects against certain strains but the ones that cause warts are not covered by the vaccine. If you were exposed before receiving the vaccine you may be a carrier.

Doctors only screen for herpes if you have symptoms because it is so common and usually asymptomatic that someone without symptoms testing positive is deemed as too much trouble for the test.

Protection fails. STIs that can pass through skin-to-skin contact are likely to be spread with protection or not if the infected area is not covered by a condom. "
13079,tldr - everything wrong with society as a whole. Read. 
13080,You were correct. I got them mixed up. Mine is through Gilead.

13086,I think I suggested they educate themselves as much as possible AND go see their doctor? Doctors make errors too. I think it is best to go with all the knowledge you can and work it all out with your doctor. 
13087,"Jebrennen. I think the reason I was upset earlier was the shear number of posts I’d seen, that it was preventable. 

I think we share coming of age during the 1980s. I saw too many people die. We were all scared and it seemed having sex was Russian roulette. 

I sat and cried after being raped and having to wait months to get the test results back.  Watched too many friends worry about their status. 

I get people may get drunk or in the moment of passion do something spontaneous. I’ve done it myself. 

I guess I want people, as much as possible, to protect themselves with knowledge. Like you said in the early days of HIV - we didn’t know what was going on, what to do, or how to stop it? We do now. Being responsible for oneself is critical. We are just making progress with HIV now. I fear now we have a pending crisis with Super Gonorrhea on the horizon. 

I do show people compassion. I also give my friends some tough love too when they drive drunk or do something else stupid, and they do the same for me. 

Sorry if my tone was too harsh. It was not meant to harm, but more from a place of love. 

"
13088,and then teenagers who are going to engage in sex anyway are ignorant about what to do and how to be safe. this abstinence-only stance is archaic and harmful
13089,"Yes, it can be. Some of us are closeted, and can't talk about about STIs with real people. I don't think that makes them stupid. It makes them human looking for a connection."

13093,"> Some of us are closeted, and can't talk about about STIs with real people.

lol. that's a problem you have to fix for yourself. "
13094,"Thanks. I’m NOT a teacher or physician, but seems pretty basic. I appreciate your kind words. "
13095,"It's not my problem to fix. It's the people in my life that need to fix themselves, and be more open-minded."
13096,thank you bro. How do I get it? Can I just walkin to pharmacy and get one of those shots or do I have to go thru my primary therapist?
13097,"Have your kids vaccinated, too. Just in case. 
I'm not saying they are going to commit zina (though young people are often stupid and make mistakes) but not all sexual intercourse is voluntary. You don't want cancer on top of it.
Boys too. They can get cancer from hpv as well. "

13103,"The upvoted comments here are atrocious.

Read the first paragraph of OP. This is great advice for a certain segment of the population. A very small segment.

DO NOT GIVE THIS VACCINE TO YOUR KIDS. There are many reasons against it and only 2 for it. Very low chance of your kid getting raped, and they don't need another excuse for zina in an already hypersexualized world."
13104,"HPV is a messed up vaccine and can cause some serious health issues down the line.

Before anyone gets it they should investigate. I'm not anti Vax but there are a LOT of questionable vaccines with nasty side affects.

13105,"How about instead of taking medication that you 99% most likely won’t need. 



You get tested first and if you test negative then unnecessary medications are best avoided.



Why are you immediately jumping from zina to vaccination with no testing for anything at all?"

If you know something, please link to some legitimate research about this vaccine. In particular are the side effects any worse than any other vaccine? [The CDC lists the common side effects](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/hpv-vaccine.html), and there is nothing there beyond what I usually see with vaccines. Swelling where the shot is given, muscle pain, etc. So I would appreciate any links to some legit science about these side effects you speak of."
13110,"The rate is that low because people get vaccinated. By rejecting the vaccine you only serve to knowlingly be a carrier of disease and you might ruin someone else's life.

13111,There’s a lot we don’t know about the HPV vaccine. Yes if you live in a developed country your chances of getting cervical cancer is basically 0 percent. The Ontario government had a massive campaign a while back but we just don’t know how effective the vaccine is. 
13112,I'm quite surprised you're getting downvoted... 
13113,"Saying anything critical against any vaccination is close to blasphemous on reddit, so expect a lot of downvotes for your comment. Unconditional approval of all vaccination is dogma on this website."

What about rape?

What an ignorant comment."
13119,What if your spouse is raped or cheats? What if your spouse had a partner before you and they had HPV. What if you are raped? There are many reasons to get the vaccine. It certainly isn't comfortable but I'm thankful I got it.

You should refrain from giving medical advice until you understand the concept of a vaccine."
13126,It's like $150 in Canada and I have to pay out of pocket :(
13127,"By a medical professional who has experience with the procedure. No backyard circumcisions pls.

Edit: also while we are at it: circumcision is not a replacement for condoms and safe sex practices. You should still talk about those with your kids. If they decide to be stupid and commit zina they shouldn't be so stupid and get themselves pregnant or an std on top of everything."
13128,There is no modern proof of this...
13129,"There are several gaps in research with the HPV vaccine. This includes the immunogenicity of the vaccines themselves. Initially the vaccine was given to females throughout school (In Grade 7 or 8, in Ontario, Canada) but there hasn't been solid research on if the vaccine is even effective 10 years later when sexual activity starts (or increases). 

> Vaccine that's being prescribed is not just for fun/government control. 

No one said it's being prescribed for fun, although I think HPV is a horrible case to prove your point because this is probably the only recent example (that easily comes to mind) of a rushed vaccine and campaign. Heck the US FDA put a stop to the vaccine for administration to women between 26 to 47. Initially this was approved by Health Canada and (out of all agencies) the FDA was the one who said ""We literally don't have enough evidence"" (and they were correct). 

The reason why cervical cancer death rates are so low in Canada or the United States is simply due to early screening. Detection of cervical cancer and the availability of treatment is really why cervical cancer rates are low. The vaccine is not paid for (unless you got it in school). So that means, again at least in Ontario, you have a population of young females who have gotten the vaccination and in comparison a relatively few number of males who have gotten the medication (out of pocket expense, also fairly pricey), and SOME women over the age of 26 who would have also had to pay for the medication. 

The fact that a lot of data is hidden is also concerning. There has been radio silence out of the Ontario government after the huge HPV vaccination campaign started. No follow up studies have been done on the effectiveness as well...

A systemic review of uptake in Canada found very wide discrepancies in uptake rates from one study to another. "
13130,"Because mostly everything anti-vaxx is based on pointless anecdotal evidence. And those who evaluate some of the real evidence, cherry pick numbers that they don't understand to make a point. 

Look up the terms Herd Immunity and what vaccines actually did in terms of the disease rates for some of the most horrible diseases. All the actual research is out there and public. It's just not in a easy-to-BS blog format, like most anti-vaxx ""research"". 

I would go as far as to say that knowingly risking other people's lives with disease is probably haraam. "
13131,"This. A while back I found myself in an argument with anti-religion, pro-human-rights-abusers who were trying to argue that everyone should be forced to get a vaccine by any means even if they had moral views against vaccines (regardless of what their moral reason was). 

&#x200B;

Suffice it to say the Reddit mob downvoted me."
13132,"Overwhelming Majority of HPV cases are from very very voluntary intercourse. 

That’s a weak argument. "
13133,"This is the only good counter argument here. As it makes the most common sense. 

However, like HIV/AIDS, you understand the problem is hyper sexualization of our society ... and now of our children. 

The medical industry is at a loss of preventing its spread amongst adolescents. So their only approach was to cast a very wide net: vaccinate all the high school kids ahead of time. 

That age of vaccination has dropped to 13yos and now 11yos. 

Islamically speaking, it’s kind of sad when you think about it. "
13134,"If your potential spouse had it, would you still marry them?"
13135,"That’s min-max. 

You’re maximizing an extreme case and minimizing a more general case for the practicing umma: no previous partners. 

Unless you can get HPV from a non sexual cough or something, you should be entirely fine, yes or no?"

You're preaching to the choir. Nobody argues against that on reddit. You do have a few people pointing out that not all vaccines are the same and some are not necessary, but they shouldn't be confused with anti-vaxxers, who don't exist on reddit.  As for the herd immunity issue, that doesn't really apply here for many monogamous Muslims who don't plan on committing zina."
13146,"Well you're doing the same by acting as if a mindless mob down voted you. There are actual reasons for supporting vaccines and downvoting dangerous beliefs. The research is there and public to support it. There is no grand conspiracy and yes you can probably survive without a vaccine, but that's just an individual perspective. There is a huge field of medical science called epidemiology that gives more context. 

The same thing exact thing happened with Soap back when it was mandated to wash hands lol. How would you feel if a mother posted saying that she never washes her kids hands and let's them roam free to play with other kids?"
13147,"You should absolutely be downvoted. Your views have the potential to influence someone to avoid vaccination. Personally, I don’t want people to die because you joined a Facebook cult. "

Please don't breed. "
13149,"Yes, because I'm getting vaccinated."

What if you get infected from an infected needle or glass out in the streets in an accident (car accident) or in the hospital?"
13154,"What about ""not all sexual intercourse is voluntary"" is so hard to understand? You think married people don't get raped?"

13156,Angels and Jinns are not physically proven. Statistical data that shows circumcised people are not as susceptible to STDs as uncircumcised people is proven.
13157,"Well you were saying that unconditional approval is expected from this website. I'm merely listing some of the actual conditions as to why people approve vaccines. 

And unfortunately/fortunately, there's no indicator to know whether someone has been monogamous or has been sexually assaulted. So I wouldn't assume.

So it still applies, whether you're Muslim or not, and getting it doesn't imply that you're some promiscuous person. Abuse is widespread and can happen to anyone. The memory alone is a lifetime ordeal- a victim shouldn't have to also deal with a physical disease either when it's easily preventable. "
13158,"Well first of all, the vast majority of people in the UK don't wash their hands after going to the toilet, or at least sufficiently. Sprinkling water on your hands doesn't do anything. And rubbing soap for 2 seconds does practically nothing.

Second, if I knew a kid didn't wash his/her hands, I'd tell my kids to avoid those kids or at least not shake their hands.

I wouldn't kidnap the kid and wash his hands.

You cannot force people to get vaccines, especially if it violates their religion. Islam teaches us to respect other peoples' faiths. You can only educate people on the Science. If they want to reject it, it's up to them. If we set the rule that we can force something on individuals if it is in the interest of the collective, be prepared to get rounded up into concentration camps at some point in the future. Islam respects the freedom and autonomy of the individual for a reason. On that point, so does international law.

I don't want to just start repeating what I already said now. [Just read my posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/9lhtp9/60_students_without_vaccines_kept_out_of_school/e77asq2/)"
13159,"Also, from our perspective, Islam is beneficial for the body and soul. Should we start forcing it on people?"

13168,"I'd like to second this. Especially in Pakistani culture, sex education and knowledge is non existent before marriage. Some parents even after marriage have little to no knowledge. "
13169,"> Statistical data that shows circumcised people are not as susceptible to STDs as uncircumcised people is proven.

This is incorrect, check articles that look at both sides of the debate: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28224100

http://healthland.time.com/2013/04/17/why-circumcision-lowers-risk-of-hiv/ 

Read up also on what happened in Uganda. They laughed at the idea of circumcision lowering the rate of HIV at first, but the results were clearly in it's favor. 

Although as Muslims, we don't support circumcision for this reason. We support it because we have textual evidence in support of it from hadith. "
13170,"You're actually doing what a lot of people on reddit incorrectly do, by treating all situations with all vaccinations the same. Herd Immunity is an effective strategy against the spread of diseases, but it's not needed against sexually transmitted diseases for monogamous couples who don't plan on committing zina.  Sure,  there is the rare chance that you can get raped and catch a sexually transmitted disease, but if you have that extreme level of paranoia, then you might also want to wear a helmet whenever you cross a street. The helmet is statistically more likely going to be able to protect you."
13171,"No, but we should with vaccines. They save millions of lives and have virtually zero downside. "

13174,Thanks for the correction. I am honestly not familiar with the HPV vaccine. 
13175,">That’s irrelevant, because both of you don’t have it.

What are you saying? In order to get infected, you and your spouse both do not need to be infected. If one of you gets raped, one of you gets infected. This is basic stuff. "
13176,Tell that to victims of sexual abuse who got stds from their attacker. 
13177,Wise words
13178,"Islam's benefits are even greater. Should we also force fruits and vegetables, halal meat and ban alcohol as well?

I should also point out that if you try and force people to get vaccines, those who are militantly opposed to it for whatever religious reason will just go off grid. They'll still be posing a risk to society, but you'll never know it. The only way to get herd immunity is via education. 

If you invent some pseudo liberal justification for forcing medical procedures on people in the interest of the collective, the same warped logic will be used against you. "

Ok. "
13181,"That not withstanding, the whole HPV thing is trying to be peddled under the umbrella issue of “vaccines”. When actually it’s really under the umbrella topic of normalizing zina into every one of our households by way of a backdoor. 

Remember: it is not an accomplishment we should boast about that our medical industry needs to vaccinate all children as young as 11 to offset rampant zina. 

It’s actually quite sad :(
"
13182,"Yes, I didn't even understand what kind of argument they were trying to make here. 

And once one spouse gets it the other can get it too, depending on the quality of the relationship (wife too scared to tell her husband for example)."
13183,"First, astaghfirullah.
Second: I'm always amazed when people start bitching when they receive what they dish out without any kind of selfreflection. Like they seriously expect a courtesy they don't even consider giving to others. "
13184,">wife too scared to tell her husband for example

That kind of a relationship honestly and in my opinion is worse than the rape itself. Your spouse should be a comfort to you, not a bully or source of terror. If a woman gets raped, your husband should be the kind of person that would kill your rapist for raping you, not kill you for getting raped."
13185,"I still feel that the rape is worse but that kind of relationship is a good second. Isn't just fear of killing though, could be many things that make a woman afraid of telling her husband - including being afraid he will get himself sent to prison when he kills the man who raped her."
13186,">including being afraid he will get himself sent to prison when he kills the man who raped her.

Good point.

I still feel an abusive relationship is worse though. I expect the embodiment of the devil in a rapist. I do not expect the devil in my spouse. Although it is not that simple since your rapist could also have been someone you trusted, making my point mute. But if the rapist was the typical criminal that you would have already suspected, my point stands.

I should clarify I am male so maybe I have a bias. Though I grew up in fear of being kidnapped due to severe bullying and the worst thing I feared was sexual abuse (not physical, despite my experience) so I can say I understand the fear. But I just think saying rape is worse is an emotional statement due to the anger people feel when they hear about rape. Also, arguably, an abusive partner (of any gender) is a rapist. They're just effective emotional manipulators.

My argument follows the same logic that being killed/beaten up by a police officer is worse than being killed by a criminal. A police officer is entrusted to protect you. A criminal is not. One is a betrayal. The other is expected."
13187,I see your point and it's validity. I might have been thoughtless in my words.
13188,I don't see how you were thoughtless.
13189,"First they said I couldn't because I was a man. Then they said I couldn't because I was too old. Now they say don't bother, you already have it by now."
13190,"I second this, my dad got throat cancer from a HPV strain. Ny doctor advised that even if you have had a multiple sexual partners it's still worth getting the vaccine"
13191,"F in my 40’s, got it last year. I had to pay out of pocket for it, which wasn’t cheap, but I don’t regret it at all - anything I can do to further decrease the risk of bad Pap smears and other cervical unpleasantness is absolutely worth it. 

Three shots, each a month apart, hurt no worse than a flu shot. I’m glad I did it. I’ll still get regular paps, but my anxiety about them will be somewhat decreased. That’s worth it to me. "
13192,"Is there any point in getting vaccinated if you’re pretty certain you already have HPV? My wife had pre-cancerous lesions that she had removed. Almost certainly caused by HPV. I’ve always assumed that since we both already have it, there’s no point in getting vaccinated. Am I wrong about this?"
13193,TIL there's an hpv vaccine. I'll try and remember to look into it.
13194,"Where I'm from, the government offers free HPV vaccine for all high school girls. My mum was against it though, showing me articles about how it's not against all strains of HPV and there are side effects. Luckily I went and get it against her will. Years later I became sexually active unexpectedly and I don't have to worry about being too late to get the vaccine"
13195,"A few things about this....the HPV vaccine is 90-something percent effective. It’s one of the most effective vaccinations we have on the market. 

Studies have shown that kids who receive the vaccine have no increased tendency to have sex at a younger age. 

There is no maximum interval between vaccinations. If you received your first dose 2 years ago, and never got your 2nd, it’s not too late! Go do it!!

Lastly, the earliest age one can receive the vaccine is 9 years old (for boys and girls). Studies have also shown that the earlier the vaccine is given, the better your body builds immunity against the virus! This is why you only need 2 vaccines if you get them very early!!

Feel free to ask questions!

13197,"Yess! My best friend currently found out that she has HPV and she’s in the process of finding out whether she has precancerous cells or if it’s actually cancer. She had her colposcopy yesterday and she was in PAIN. She’s been trying for a year or so to have a baby and now it might be that she won’t be able to have a baby. I asked her if she had the vaccine (cause I do), and she said no. So it’s pretty scary. Being with her through this difficult process has made me gain more knowledge about it and allowed me to talk to ALL my friends to get checked and to get vaccinated. 

Please be safe everyone! Do it for yourself now and for your future! "
13198,"My manipulative parents didn’t let me get vaccinated in order to stop me having sex... they said it’s “only for dirty people with dirty lifestyles” - joke is, two years later when I was about 16, I got a splinter, and it seemed that the scar was still there. Apparently it was HPV in my hand...😱😱"
13199,"PSA: check out your health department. 

I got the Gardasil vaccine at my local health department for $10 per dose, for a total of $30. I did not have insurance at the time but I wanted to be vaccinated. So, I drove to my local health department to ask if they offered it, bc they also offer other vaccinations for free or at a lower cost to residents.

The receptionist only asked me for my licence (as proof of residence) and payment. This was, at the time, a $300 vaccination. Please dont think you can't get vaccinated bc of the cost. Check out your health department!"

Honestly, the thing that raised a red flag about the vaccine were the commercials for it--they're kind of over-the-top and manipulative. I don't see me not having her get it, though. 

I'm definitely not worried about her thinking ""wow, I got a shot....now I can go have ALL THE SEX."" I just want to read up on what to expect in terms of potential side effects. "

13205,"I’m not against this vaccine, I got it when I was a teenager. But I will say this: try to boost your immune system with some multivitamins and supplements before getting it. My immune system tanked right after I finished the set. (Edit: it made an autoimmune-like disease rear its ugly head for the first time.) I’ve read story after story of this happening. And immune support is never a bad idea anyway.

13207,"What age would you recommend the vaccine. And if you should get the vaccine before sex. Because I am a virgin and I’m also 14. Would it be necessary for me. I also read that it would boost the immunity to it. Should I get it. If so, how would I tell my mom that I want it?"
13208,"Wish I could upvote this more! I wasn't allowed to get the vaccine when I was in high school because my parents thought it would ""suggest they were giving me permission to have sex"". As soon as I educated myself to the clinic I went (a month before I turned 26 so barely made it in time)! I don't know if this is true everywhere, but I know where I live that the local vaccination clinic had an option for me to check that my insurance didn't cover the vaccine or I didn't have insurance so they gave it to me for free! Can't hurt to ask. :)"
13209,"This.  I was 16 when the vaccine came out, not yet sexually active. My doctor recommended that I get it. My mom did not think it was a good idea. She was worried we would find out about long term reproductive side effects years down the road. So I never got it. I had my first abnormal pap in 2016. Colposcopy (which was horrible) showed low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.  Subsequent pap last spring was also abnormal. Need to go in for a repeat soon, as I had a minor bacterial infection at the time that appatently may have affected the results. 

My mom was really upset when I told her.  She hates the commercials.  In a way they kind of haunt her. She's apologized multiple times and feels like this is her fault, even though everything might still turn out ok. 

Get the vaccine. Not getting it has caused me so much stress and worry. And it might not be over yet. "
13210,"It's also worth noting that it's recommended to get the vaccine around the age of 12. I know that most 12 year olds aren't sexually active, however, you have to think about your child's future. Them getting  the vaccine  will  not make them be sexually  active sooner. They will have sex at some point, so you may as well help them be prepared as possible. "
13211,"I didn't get vaccinated at school like most schoolgirls in the UK do. I went to my GP when I was 19 and told that it's only available for free for girls under 18 and that I didn't qualify. And then, after enquiring how much it would be to have the vaccine privately, I was told it would cost in excess of £200, or a ridiculous amount for an unemployed student. And then ON TOP OF THAT, the staff recommended that I don't even get it if I'm sexually active as it reduces the reliability of the vaccine, or words to that effect.

OK, I said, fair enough. I can't get the vaccine. When can I start getting yearly pap smears to check for cervical abnormalities?

Not until I'm 25.

So if you're over 18, and you haven't got the vaccine, and you're sexually active, and you get some nasty cancer like cervical cancer, you're not allowed to get a pap smear until you're 25. Essentially I'd call that 7 years of medical neglect. "
13212,"This post brings back anger and frustration for me because I had a huge fight with my mom this year when I found out at age 23 that she refused the vaccine for me. I begged her to look into it for my younger siblings and she refused because she thinks they will only have sex with their future virgin spouse, so there's absolutely no need for it. I hate religion. Getting my third dose next week."
13213,"My father got throat cancer from HPV and survived, however he recently had a stroke caused by one of the cancer veins, he is only 54 years old and there is a 45% chance he will have another one in the next year and odds are that it will be fatal this time. Please get this vaccine folks."
13214,"OP, thank you so much for educating people on this post. I got the shots in high school at my mother’s request, and I didn’t become sexually active for another two years.

I’m sorry you’re getting spammed by Qanon followers in the comments."
13215,"So here's my story, let me preface by saying I'm not dead or dying. I am a 38F who had a hysterectomy at 33. I got HPV at a pretty young age and had abnormal pap smears for years.  Eventually the abnormality turned precancerous and I had a LEEP (which is very unpleasant). The first few months afterward I had normal pap smears (yay!) And then one day, it was abnormal again. I also around this time had a prolapsed uterus,  which didn't require surgery but due to my history of HPV the doc and I decided a hysterectomy was my best and safest bet. 

When I was young the vaccine wasn't available yet. And if you look through my post history you will see that even I was on the fence about getting my own kids vaccinated. But the more I research, along with putting my own story into their lives, the more I realize I NEED to vaccinate them. It's too late for me but I will do everything I can to prevent my kids from having my experience. "
13216,[deleted]
13217,Well this just scared the shit out of me. 
13218,I'm going in two weeks for the second shot in the series! I'm so glad I decided to do it at last.
13219,I was vaccinated and still got it. it is important to get vaccinated but it only protects against certain strains. 
13220,First time ive ever heard of man getting vacinated against hpv. Please inform me.
13221,"For the record, vaccines are good...

Let’s all remember that HPV does not equal cancer. Some folks will get strains that will cause abnormal cells to creep up. They may clear up, or they may progress to cancer. Some will just get warts. Some will contract a strain and never know it because they’re asymptomatic.


I know cancer is scary as hell but let’s make sure we don’t automatically panic and think we’re going to die of cancer when we hear “HPV”... 


nearly 50% of us have at least some strain. Get checked regularly. Vaccinate if you can."
13222,"I have the ultimate vaccination.

Loneliness."
13223,"My parents don’t won’t let me get it because they think if I don’t get the vaccine, it will keep me from being sexually active. Ugh "
13224,I asked my doctor. She refused cuz I'm over 26. Kappa
13225,"And get teh autismz hell no! 



/s. Fucking obviously."
13226,"In my part of Canada, it was given to girls only in Grade 7. Offered, I should say - parents could say no. I have two boys and at the time HPV was only linked to cervical cancer, but I wanted them to have it anyway since there was a chance that not all women they’d sleep with in the future would have been vaccinated, plus genital warts - who needs them. My oldest was turned down by the Dept of Health, and by the time my youngest was in Grade 7, it was known that HPV caused oral and throat cancer also, but it was still not available for boys. I asked at the pharmacy - it would have cost me $1800 each, all out of pocket, to get them vaccinated - I just couldn’t swing $3600, or another $1800 for myself. The year my youngest was in Grade 8, they started offering it to boys in Grade 7, covered by the Dept of Health. 

What a farce. The cost of these cancers to the healthcare industry in any developed country should justify public immunization. "
13227,"Rape happens. A lying partner happens. Condoms break. 

Doesn’t matter if you’ve been tested, aren’t sexually active, or always use protection. HPV isn’t worth it. Get your ass vaccinated. "
13228,Can you still get vaccinated as an adult? I’m M21. 
13229,"My mom took me to get the series of vaccines when I was 12/13, the year the original Gardasil commercials came out. It didn’t encourage me to go out and have tons of unprotected sex, it didn’t cause autism or any other nonsense anti-vaxxers claim. What it did was prevent some HPV strains. Totally worth it."
13230,"My sister-in-law has a daughter that is 15. She refuses to let her get the vaccine. ""Side effects."" She's convinced it's nothing but horrible side effects and sees it as a bad thing."
13231,Also worth noting it's free in New Zealand if you're under 27. Male or female!
13232,"**Before** you get vaccinated, just **make sure** you are **not allergic** to this type of vaccine. If you are not sure, there are medical offices and public and private hospitals in where they do allergy testing."
13233,"I believe the vaccine only protects against strains with cancer right?

Like you can still get hpv but it would be benign"
13234,Also sidenote. Be aware that this one only protects you from a select few strains of HPV. There are dozens of types out there. 
13235,I got gardasil when I was a teenager. Still got HPV this year but probably not the worst strain of it. Still under watch by my gyno but I still advise people to get it
13236,I just can’t afford to go to the doctor 
13237,Where can a male over the age of 26 get HPV vaccine if his doctor won't give it? 
13238,"Guys I am doing AMA about HPV and Vaccine

13239,"Omg I can't even pay all my bills in the same month, I don't got $200 extra dollars for that shit."
13240,"I had 1st vaccine, fine.  Second one tore my myelin sheath from nerves within hours.  Decade+ later and still dealing with the aftermath.  Hospital admitted it WAS a Vax injury. Didn't have 3rd shot.

Ps. I'm not anti Vax despite this. "
13241,"I am 100% pro-vaccine, but I haven't gotten the hpv vaccine because I've seen two other people get it and immediately afterwards they experienced necrosis (cell death) at the site of the injection--leaving their arms permanently weakened. It scares me. I'm a pretty physically active individual and wouldn't want to risk that. I'm also not sexually active, so I should be okay for the time being."
13242,"I really need to get it. I’m still on my parents’ insurance and they think the HPV vaccine will cause paralysis and death, as well as it being immoral. No way I can get it with insurance without them seeing. 

Paying out of pocket isn’t really an option right now. Guess I’ll wait till I have a job within the next year or so. "
13243,"Here are some thoughts about it, however. Know the risks. This is CBS not some crazy natural health site.   


""The risks of serious adverse events including death reported after  Gardasil use in (the JAMA article by CDC's Dr. Barbara Slade) were  3.4/100,000 doses distributed. The rate of serious adverse events on par  with the death rate of cervical cancer.  Gardasil has been associated  with at least as many serious adverse events as there are deaths from  cervical cancer developing each year.  Indeed, the risks of vaccination  are underreported in Slade's article, as they are based on a denominator  of doses distributed from Merck's warehouse.  Up to a third of those  doses may be in refrigerators waiting to be dispensed as the autumn  onslaught of vaccine messages is sent home to parents the first day of  school.  Should the denominator in Dr. Slade's work be adjusted to  account for this, and then divided by three for the number of women who  would receive all three doses, the incidence rate of serious adverse  events increases up to five fold.  How does a parent value that  information,"" said Harper.   


[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gardasil-researcher-speaks-out/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gardasil-researcher-speaks-out/)"
13244,"I do agree that people should get vaccinated for this. However, I had my 3 rounds of shots before I was ever sexually active, and when I was 25 I was diagnosed with high risk HPV, and have had to have 2 colposcopies because I had pre-cancerous cells. This is the first year in 3 years it finally came back normal. Moral of the story - the vaccine does not protect against all strains, as that is what my doctor told me because I was so confused on how I could've gotten it. "
13245,"I hope this gets up voted but just so everyone knows:

YOU CAN STILL GET HPV IF YOU HAVE HAD THE VACCINE. PRACTICE SAFE SEX. 

I just went through two separate colposcopies (they biopsied my cervix) because I had HPV and abnormal cells. I've had the vaccine. The nurse told me the vaccine only protects against certain strands and there are HUNDREDS of them. But also remember, mostly everyone has had HPV and not even known it because most of the strains don't cause any harm. 

Just practice safe sex. Always. "
13246,"You cannot trust people to practice safe sex and even if they do, condoms aren’t always effective "
13247,Is it worth getting if you're old and married? 
13248,"This is interesting, because as a 28-year old man, I was told that I am now too old for the vaccine to be effective, as it's more for teens-early 20's. This was in response to asking for the vaccine at a checkup.

Edit: I read the comments below about 26 being the *insurance* age-cutoff. I will consider asking about Gardasil-9 and just pay the money. Definitely worth it for the peace of mind."
13249,"I've actually been kind of concerned about this. I was sleeping with a girl about a year ago and she took ambien before bed to help her sleep (but liked staying awake/the usual getting high on ambien thing). 
Personally I'm not a fan, I was completely sober. We'd had sex a few times with condoms, but one night she got off me, and said ""I'm on the pill, so unless you have any diseases, let's get rid of this,"" and pulled the condom off. The sex was great, and we were just having a bit of pillow talk, all of a sudden her eyes open up wide and she tells me ""Oh fuck, I'm on the pill, you're not going to get me pregnant but I forgot I have HPV!""
I've been tested since then and it came back clean, but I made a point to ask about HPV and the nurse said it hadn't shown up.
I know tests can come back wrong (I once smoked a bowl an hour before getting my blood drawn once and had a tox panel done just out of curiosity and I tested negative for THC. I smoke several times a day.) It's also worth noting she never mentioned it when she was sober but this one night she'd taken her ambien and chased it with a beer before we went to bed.

I've heard about a vaccine but it sounded like something you get when you're in your mid-teens, is it worth getting the vaccine if I'm 29? Just in case the test showed a false-negative? I'll probably get tested again at a different lab just to be sure but even if I don't have it, I'm interested in getting vaccinated for it (if the vaccine does, in fact, work on adults) just to avoid this anxiety in the future."
13250,Serious question. Would long-term monogamous couples have to get it?
13251,"Male virgin in his mid 30s here (don't plan on staying that way).  I finally talked my doctor into writing my a prescription for it, but the pharmacy refused to fill it.  I eventually just gave up.  Maybe if I wore a tshirt that said 'Older Virgin; Likes Muffdiving Porn', I might get taken more seriously."
13252,Looks like we've got some anti-vaxxer knuckleheads in the comments
13253,Somebody should link the thread where some poor woman posted about her neighbor’s unvaccinated kids infecting and killing her newborn. 
13254,[removed]
13255,"So back when the HPV shot was first introduced (and was so scandalous because they were recommending it to girls 12 and over lol), my mom took me to get the first two shots, but we never got around to getting the third. This was around 2004/2005, so I was maybe 13ish. 

My question is, would I have to start the series all over, or would I only have to get the third and final shot? "
13256,"Y'all okay didn't gardisil get recalled years ago because young girls were getting, like, fucked up by it? Wasn't there massive issues against it??? "
13257,Theres a chance if I get it that it'll paralyze me and I'll have to get years of PT to even walk again.
13258,"I’ve spent the last 2 years trying to get info on this from Doctor after doctor. 

I am a 32yo male. I have an extensive sexual history, and am now in a long term relationship. 

I guess there is absolutely no way to determine if I have contracted HPV or not. (I **really** wanted to know) 

So my question is this: if I have already contracted HPV in the past, and let’s just say for
Simplicity’s sake that I’ll never sleep with anyone else ever again, would there be any benefit to getting vaccinated now?? 

I am very concerned about the long term cancer risks of HPV, and I want to do **anything** I can to help reduce those risks. 

I assume that getting the vaccine after being exposed to HPV won’t help any with the HPV I’d *already* have, but I don’t know **for sure**!!! 

Can anyone tell me if getting it will make any difference to someone that likely has HPV already? 

Also, does anyone know of any other ways I can help prevent future HPV related side effects, such as cancer, from manifesting? "
13259,Important question: does the vaccine make a difference if there’s already a chance you could’ve been infected with HPV? Also I’m a man 
13260,"I think I will get vaccinated against HPV, instead of for it. If you don’t mind."
13261,Is there an age cut off for getting Vaccinated for HPV? 
13262,Is there meant to be a 'top up'? I had the vaccine at 16 (f) at school and I vaguely remember mention of a booster shot? I'm pretty good with stuff like sexual health but it was a grey area when I first got the shot 9 years ago and I think it had only recently been implemented.
13263,"God. This. I was supposed to get it years ago (I’m a woman) and at the time my mom didn’t wanna take the time to get me vaccinated. I see my doctor today and because she just got back to me between my appointments about what vaccines I’ve had based on records, I now know I don’t have the HPV vaccine. I’m 19 and I just wish this would’ve been something my mom would’ve taken me to do years ago. I don’t mind doing it now but believe as you get older you have to take multiple shots a month or something? Correct me if I’m wrong. "
13264,I'm a guy in my 30s... how do I get vaccinated?
13265,"I'd love to, but it's going to cost almost $1000 and my benefits won't cover it. The Canadian healthcare system is pretty alright, but it's not the best, unfortunately. "
13266,"Yeah, it's actually pretty awesome there is an anti-STD vaccine now. I think Gardasil is the first one! "
13267,"Hey gang... let’s suppose that I’m a dumb, busy person with ADD and that I got my first shot but completely forgot about scheduling my second and third shots. Do I start the series over? How does this work haha"
13268,"You know, as a straight male in the UK, who is above 30, it seems I can't even get the HPV vaccine"
13269,"Too bad this is not approved for every demographic. If more people were vaccinated it would make HPV spread around less, maybe become less commonplace. I'm sure it's cheaper to vaccinate people and prevent cancer than to treat them when they develop a cancer from the HPV virus. "
13270,"Hey gang... let’s suppose that I’m a dumb, busy person with ADD and that I got my first shot but completely forgot about scheduling my second and third shots. Do I start the series over? How does this work haha"
13271,"I am not a doctor and I’m not offering advice. I am a 28 year old, straight, cis-gender man. I have had a handful of sexual partners.  One of them was a long term partner with whom I almost never used a condom. I have not had an HPV vaccination. I asked my doctor if I should get vaccinated the last time I saw him. He said that if I was a virgin he would probably recommend it, but otherwise that there was no compelling reason for me to get vaccinated."
13272,"Bah. I was going to get this vaccine some years ago when it first came out. My gyn told me that since I am already sexually active, I can't get the vaccine, only virgins can get it..."
13273,"I'm 24f ...is it too late? Plus, I'm in a monogamous long term relationship (probably getting married) so is it worth it?"
13274,"My best friend's step dad just died from throat cancer linked to HPV.  He lived a healthy life, never smoked, drank, ate right.  They did some test after a sore throat persisted for a few months. Caught it at stage 4 and he was dead within 8 months.  Please get vaccinated. "
13275,"My friends uncle is dying of hpv based cancer. They gave him 3 moths to live. It is all, and I mean all, through him.

Get the vaccine everyone! "
13276,"My ""issue"" is that I have alopecia and one of the treatments made my immune system weak as fuuuck. So doctors said I shouldn't take any vaccines because my system was down (he was a 90 year old doctor not sure how right or wrong he was. I was also very young at the time) 
Now I'm not doing it, has been 3 years since the treatment. But I'm still scared of getting the vaccine.
I have one to take at 25 years oldand they are OK with it... Is this OK too?
My gynecologist didn't said a word about it and my last exams were all good. "
13277,"I'm a 21 (22 in a month) year old virgin, is this still super important for me to get?

Also, is this something commonly given to kids? (I assume not but just want to make sure I've never gotten it)."
13278,"Yes, thank you for sharing this! The HPV vaccine is an incredible thing! It can prevent 6 different types of cancer in both men and women. I do presentations on this topic a few times per month and the amount of misinformation out there is jarring. The series of shots was previously a series of three. Depending on age, some people are now able to have only two to be fully vaccinated. Even better - we’re working on getting it down to a one shot vaccination! Hopefully that will be a reality within the next few years. 

The ideal age for the vaccine is 11-12, but it can be done up to age 26 (or older, but insurance often won’t cover it at that point...plus, it’s far more effective before sexual contact begins). Please vaccinate your kids and share this info with your loved ones who have kids. We could LITERALLY eliminate 6 types of cancer from the next generation. You can find more info at www.cancer.org/hpv. 

Sending well wishes to your friend through her journey. "
13279,"My dad recently got diagnosed with cancer from HPV. Its been a long struggle to get him to understand what it is. I eventually just told him to google Michael Douglas and cancer 🤣 He's the oldest 52 year old ever, I swear. He acted like I said he has herpes. Then acted like the doctors said it was like mono. No, dad, no it isn't. My stepmom...gawd. Her response was, ""We trust each other"" 🙄🙄 Oh my word. I gave up. 

I got them but not until I was 17. Luckily I wasn't sexually active until much later. However, at the time the shots didn't protect against as many strains as it does now.

My kids will get vaccinated because of my dad (and therefore my mother) having it. "
13280,"When I was 13, all girls in the country had to get the HPV vaccine. I was deeply phobic of needles at the time. It was given in 3 installments which ended up being good as having to go through with an injection several times in a few months meant I had to get used to it.

Downside was it made the top side of your arm fucking BURN and ache when you tried to raise it. It was absurdly painful for a good few days after. And cause it was well known all the Year 9 girls were getting jabs, random arm punches in the school corridor became a thing!"
13281,"I’m 19 and before entering college, we’re required to get vaccinations. The HPV vaccination was optional for men because “men can’t get HPV”.

I said fuck that, give me it anyways. Got vaccinated and am extremely happy I made that choice. 

Even though my (likely only) partner and I hadn’t had sex with anyone before our relationship, I think it’s best to get vaccinated anyways. You never know what could happen..."
13282,This topic confuses me so much. I want the cut and dried version please. 
13283,[removed]
13284,Should I get the vaccine if I’m already married to my only sexual partner and in a monogamous relationship? 
13285,"Too late, my mother never took me to get the vaccination. Keep spreading the word, thank you!!"
13286,"If you’re unsure if you got this as a kid/teen, is there any downside to getting it as an adult and potentially having the same shot twice?"
13287,I tried to get vaccinated and was informed that I couldn't because I'm not a virgin and probably already have HPV. :(
13288,"Luckily, in the UK the majority of girls get it at school when they're 13, only a very small minority refuse it, and even then, they need a signed form. "

13294,I got the vaccinations at school. I was one of the first groups to get it done. Because of that they have increased the age of pap smears.

13296,"I got all of them in middle or high school (my mom is very cautious and into getting vaccinations - she always calls me to ask if i got my flu shot every fall/winter) but do you ever need to get it again, or I'm good for life?"
13297,Just got my final shot for this. Woo hoo
13298,"M/36, Canada

I've thought about it. It's $200/shot and not covered. My physician was even skeptical about me getting the shot, and my Doctor's Secretary dismissed it as for women only.

Honestly, I like my family doctor a lot, but the only time a doctor took me seriously was when I went for a routine STI screening. I have a prescription for Gardasil 9, which is a three shot process. $600 is a lot and I feel like women would get more mileage out of it than men. It makes more sense to locate and support a non-profit that can make it more available for women who might not be otherwise eligible for a free vaccination.

That said, your suggestion that there are risk factors that aren't discussed for men has certainly caught my attention and I'd like to learn more."
13299,There’s got to be a need for the vaccine otherwise they wouldn’t bother giving it to anyone. Why waste all that money if you don’t even need the vaccine? They don’t even bother with the chicken pox vaccine in the U.K. so there’s clearly some sort of need for the HPV vaccine. It’s just common sense. 
13300,"This whole post and thread sound like a big pharma commercial. 

After hearing that the CDC was a private company and the makers of the HPV vaccine  gave them $90mln or something like that fot the push of mandated shots. I'll have to look for more info on it to make a decision. "

13305,"> If anyone has evidence that my understanding of the consensus is flawed, I'd be happy to review that evidence, but since at this point you're making the extraordinary claim, the burden of proof is on you.

That's a bit rich given you've made evidence free assertions (you've cited no sources) and yours is the extraordinary claim.

Your recommendation ...
>  everyone who hasn't gone through with getting, yourself or your children, vaccinated for HPV to get that done at the soonest possible opportunity, ... [excepting] ""A licensed physician has told me I have a medical condition that makes me unable to safely receive a vaccine""- You're good. 

... contradicts the Australian scientific consensus on HPV recommendations.

https://beta.health.gov.au/services/human-papillomavirus-hpv-immunisation-service 
>  HPV immunisation is recommended for:

> * people aged approximately 12 to 13 years (at school), for free under the National Immunisation Program (NIP)
*  men who have sex with men, if they have not already had a full course of HPV vaccine
* people over 9 years old who have weakened immune systems.

> ... The decision to immunise adults aged 19 years or over depends on whether you are likely to have already been infected with HPV, and whether you are likely to be infected in the future.

> *Adults aged ≥19 years*

> Vaccination of all women in this age group is not routinely recommended, as many are likely to have been exposed to one or more vaccine HPV types through sexual activity (refer to 4.6.3 Epidemiology above).

> However, some adult females may gain an individual benefit from HPV vaccination. The decision to vaccinate older females should take into account their likelihood of previous exposure to HPV and their future risks of HPV exposure.

> *Adults aged ≥19 years*

> Vaccination of all men in this age group is not routinely recommended as many are likely to have been exposed to one or more vaccine HPV types through sexual activity (refer to 4.6.3 Epidemiology above).

The decision to vaccinate older males should take into account their likelihood of previous exposure to HPV and their future risks of HPV exposure. Although the 4vHPV vaccine is only registered for use in males 9–26 years of age, there are no theoretical concerns that the efficacy or safety of this vaccine in males up to the age of 45 years will differ significantly from that in younger males, or females of the same age.

Your recommendation also contradicts the American Scientific Consensus
https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/vaccine.html
> *When should my child be vaccinated?*

> In this video, a family physician explains his decision, as a doctor and a parent, to make sure each of his children received HPV vaccine at age 11 or 12. HPV vaccine is cancer prevention. Ask about it for your child.

> All kids who are 11 or 12 years old should get two shots of HPV vaccine six to twelve months apart. Adolescents who receive their two shots less than five months apart will require a third dose of HPV vaccine. ...

> *Who else should get the HPV vaccine?*

> Teen boys and girls who did not start or finish the HPV vaccine series when they were younger should get it now.

> HPV vaccine is recommended for young women through age 26, and young men through age 21. HPV vaccine is also recommended for the following people, if they did not get vaccinated when they were younger:

> * young men who have sex with men, including young men who identify as gay or bisexual or who intend to have sex with men through age 26;
* young adults who are transgender through age 26; and
* young adults with certain immunocompromising conditions (including HIV) through age 26.

13306,I understand the concern for getting this vaccine but please so all your research before . I personally chose to opt out because of the side effects alone. I will not encourage anyone either way just do your research 
13307,"Please be careful. These are just facts. You make your own decision.

It's so hard to know which way to turn on things like this. I'm not a professional or student of these practices but having such convincing things completely contradict each other is very confusing. 

I've had an ex who was diagnosed with it that went in for her regular recently and was told it just cleared itself up as it does in most cases, but a few years ago I was told it is something that doesn't go away once contracted, by a doctor. Very perplexing stuff. "
13310,Hpv vaccine literally does nothing. Use protection and pick your partners wisely. The end

13313,"Hpv vaccine is absurd. I'm not saying don't get it I got it and always suggest others get it as well, but the actual one is absurd. It's 3 shots over the course of like a month and a half and they all hurt like a mother and can make you pass out it really needs an update from when I got it a couple years ago"
13314,Based on the research I have done there is no proof that this vaccine prevents cancer so I tend to not jump on a vaccine bandwagon based on fear propaganda.  Just my opinion.
13315,"Also @men, HPV can cause cancer in men too!"
13316,"Last I checked, and I could be wrong, that it was only offered to people before a certain age. Not only that, but it was a vaccination men couldnt get"
13317,[removed]
13318,"This one vaccine we will not do. Such a small risk (overall) if u get the shot and such a small risk if you dont. 
Does not outweigh the small benfits for me and my family. "
13319,Herd immunity is a myth. The stats for HPV vaccines are horrible. You need to look more into HPV - why a vaccine? 
13320,Apparently you do if you get so irate over a minor comment..little defensive.
13321,"NOPE. CHECK THE STATS ON THIS NEWLY DEVELOPED ""VACCINE""!!!!!!"
13322,Or you could just not have sex?
13323,"I got them when I was 18, for free.

My husband (we are monogamous) was suggested to get it by his last civilian doctor. The greedy doctor failed to tell him that it was NOT covered by our insurance, and billed him nearly a thousand dollars for just the first fucking shot.

Fuck it. Never saw that asshole again. Also solidified my distrust for young doctors. Never again will I see a doctor under 40 willingly.

Edit: sure, not all young doctors are in it for the money, but with *my experience*, older doctors have more empathy, they genuinely seem to give a few more fucks than the young ones I have went to. Again, that's just my fucking experience. A thousand dollars is a lot of fucking money."
13324,"Routine hiv testing, and pregnancy tests should also be done for my 12 year old daughter who isnt sexually active, but could be for all i know?    Risk stratification also has to do with informing a patient that should she plan on being sexually active, that precautions should be taken (hpv vax).  I dont think this is for all children and dont feel that i am placing my daughter at risk either."
13325,"The “too old” thing is basically for insurance purposes. You’re too old for insurance to pay for the vaccine, (because statistically you’ve probably already been exposed) not for it to be effective for you specifically. If you’re willing to get it out of pocket, you can probably still get it. "
13326,"I actually have one of the cancer causing ones and my doctor recommended that I still get vaccinated.  She says it will help avoid contracting other dangerous kinds.

Citation needed, but I think I read somewhere that a study is going on that shows the HPV vaccine is being used to shrink certain kinds of cancers, also.  

I had to pay out of pocket but i think it’s worth it to get vaccinated.  It’s so offensive that insurance companies won’t cover older individuals for vaccines that could save lives."
13327,"You can still get it. You might just have to pay for it privately. Keep in mind that if money is tight, [just one shot](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29551226) is really worth it. The research shows that there are significantly diminishing marginal returns to the second and third shots. That said, if you can get all three, definitely do."
13328,Lol
13329,How old are you? I'm looking to get it but afraid I'll be told the same thing
13330,upvote done upvote back
13331,That's just your insurance company talking through your doctor's mouth.  They tend to crawl in there and infect the doctors who don't get vaccinated against them.
13332,"I really hope this attitude changes in the future. The good news is evidence is starting to appear of benefits to receiving the vaccine after exposure. 

a quick example: https://amp-timeinc-net.cdn.ampproject.org/v/amp.timeinc.net/time/3828839/hpv-vaccine-works?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s   (2015, so kind of old. I guess I shouldn't say it is starting to appear) "

13334,"I've said it before and I will say it again, I watched my best friend's dad die of throat, progressed to lung, cancer as the direct result of HPV... there is no reason not to be vaccinated and to take this shit seriously. "
13335,"Is there an age limit on when you can no longer receive the vaccine? Also, does insurance cover it?"
13336,"My father and aunt both had HPV related throat cancers. My dad's was late stage 3/early 4 and his treatment was excruciating (serious burns from radiation, etc.) and yet he was lucky. His recovery was better than a lot of others in his support group for throat cancer. At least he's been able to keep his teeth and eat normal food again. My aunt still eats through a tube 15 years later.  

Do not f around with these cancers. It's a serious threat to both genders. "
13337,"My step mom died from cervical cancer from HPV. My mom has also had pre-cancerous cells found in a pap. And yet, I only found out about the vaccine from Reddit a few months ago. None of my friends have had it either, even though it was available when we were teens. It's shocking that it isn't mandatory or at least widely pushed by doctors, like other vaccines, in my area. When I did find out about it, I immediately got my first shot. My last shot is tomorrow. I'm 25. It was expensive, but it's a price I'm willing to pay for my life. "
13338,My grandpa died of throat/mounth cancer from hpv that eventually spread to his lungs. No idea how long hpv has been around but he probably contracted it when he was young and was healthy enough to shed the viral load until his early 70s when it finally manifested as cancer. A lot of people still don't think males need the vaccine but i hope every time i tell this story i can change at least one person's mind. 
13339,What if I already have it? Is there an undo?
13340,My uncle died from throat cancer from HPV. Much agreed! 
13341,"Do you mind my asking how much it cost you? I know costs vary across the nation, but my gf is considering getting it, but is too old for her insurance to cover it."
13342,"If you are in the US, your provider doesn’t know the dosing schedule for HPV vaccine. The schedule for those 15yrs and older is 1st dose, 2nd dose-2 months later, 3rd dose-4 months after 2nd dose. Source: Pediatric Office RN and Merck Gardasil 9 package insert. "
13343,That would be a question best for your PCP.
13344,I was told yes by my doctor. Both of you should be vaccinated to avoid reinfection by your partner if your body clears the strain. 
13345,"Yes. Most healthy people can clear the cancer-causing strains (16 and 18 most notably) within a few years. The vaccine helps build an immune response which aids in preventing reinfection with these strains which can reduce the future risk of another, possibly more advanced lesion. "
13346,"My cursory search wasnt exactly scientifically rigorous, but I did find an article on Time that suggests it's still a good idea. They do link to a scientific study, but I dont have time to read the original.

https://amp-timeinc-net.cdn.ampproject.org/v/amp.timeinc.net/time/3828839/hpv-vaccine-works?amp_js_v=a2&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQCCAE%3D#referrer=https://www.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s"
13347,"Yes!! There are multiple strains which the vaccine covers. Chances are you/she hasn’t had *all* of them, so it will cover you against the ones you haven’t been exposed to. "
13348,"I can't definitively answer your question, but can provide you with some current personal info that may be useful.

Around 15 yrs ago, I had some pre-cancerous cells removed. I am not sure if they were caused by HPV, but I think my doctor at the time told me ""most likely"". Since then, I have had regular PAP smears that have all come back negative (yay!). Last week, my PAP smear included HPV screening, and my results show both the PAP and HPV screening are negative. I am not a doctor (and would love to hear others' opinions if they are most informed), but I take that to mean that I (likely) had HPV before, the abnormal cells were removed ~15 years ago, and now I no longer have HVP. Not sure if my assumption is correct, but it seems like it to me?

I am now thinking I should get the HPV vaccine and will talk to my doctor about it."
13349,"There are a couple hundred strains of HPV. Gardasil immunizes against the most lethal strains. You can pick that shit up from being sexually assaulted, and if (heaven forfend) one of you should die and the other remarries..."
13350,"My doctor also told me to get the vaccine, after I already had it, and had pre-cancerous lesions removed. I get tested regularly and it seems I fended the virus off myself before getting the vaccine. "
13351,"Definitely get the vaccine. The studies are hard to interpret in the sense that there are a lot of variables, and no one can say definitively whether or not the vaccine will be effective given your particular sexual history. However, there is definitely evidence to suggest some efficacy in those who have been previously exposed (usually anywhere between 25-75%). It might not seem like a big enough number, especially given the financial cost. However, I perform scientific research for a living, and we always like to ask ourselves, would we rather be in the group that's 40% likely to die, or 60% likely to die? "
13352,Gardasil 9 covers nine strains and only came out a few years ago. The previous vaccine addressed four strains. I went ahead and got vaccinated for the nine strains in my late 40s to prevent contracting any strains I had not yet been exposed to. I had to pay out of pocket but I'd rather do that than kick myself after an abnormal pap or warts. 
13353,"There are many strains of HPV. The vaccine covers 13 of the worst ones. Also, HPV is typically cleared by the body, so you could be reinfected. Get the vaccine. "
13354,It’s never too late to get vaccinated. You can always be reinfected or get another strain. The most common are 9 and 11. The vaccine protects against 9 other strains that are potentially seen. 
13355,"I've had the vaccine and had precancerous lesions. Precancerous just means it's abnormal, it doesn't necessarily mean it's cancer. It just means it could potentially become cancer if left untreated. "
13356,"It is amazing. It’s a miracle that you can avoid cancer so easily, isn’t it?"
13357,"It feels mildly ironic to suggest not getting a free vaccine because it only covers *some* strains. Like, it's not worth getting because it doesn't protect you from all of them...not being protected from some of them is a bad thing... so conclusion it's *better* to be protected from none of them?!

Sorry, people confuse me :P"
13358,"I'm 26F. Is it still worth it to get it?

I Googled and some info said by my age, I've been sexually active for a long time, so I've already likely been exposed to the viruses. "
13359,"Would you happen to know where I might be able to get this done at no or low cost? I'm a full time university student on Medicaid, no income, 30, female. 

I called Planned Parenthood earlier today to ask about this and they said I would have to pay out of pocket; over $200 for the initial visit, plus $150 for each follow up."
13360,Is that educational piece publicly available? I'd love to link to it in the OP if possible.
13361,[deleted]
13362,"
I [23f] got the first two rounds of the shot a little over a year ago, but had a pretty bad reaction to the second one (swelling/fevered skin around injection site, mouth slightly swelled, lips swelled and blistered). My doctor told me not to worry about the last one because they were afraid I would have a worse reaction to it. With just the first two should I be covered for the most part?"
13363,"I mentioned this in another part of the thread, but maybe you can also speak to this. Apparently it is still possible to get one of the dangerous strains even after having the vaccine, because according to what my health care provider told me, the vaccine is really only effective for about 10 years. I got it when I was 14 or so, and now, at 27, I had an abnormal pap come back with an HPV-positive result (specifically the 16/18 strain that causes cervical cancer).

Just wanted to add that, since no one really mentions the fact that the vaccine does not necessarily protect you forever and a booster might be a good idea. Have you dealt with any women/men in their 20s/30s coming back for a ""booster"" shot of this sort?"
13364,"Male, I got it at 37. Paid out of pocket for it, couple hundred bucks, but worth it."
13365,"Vaccine has been tested up to 45 years.

"
13366,"I'd ask your physician.  I got it at 26 no problem and am also male.

Edit: This seems to vary regionally; as such, I will mention that I live in suburban Eastern Pennsylvania, USA. My insurance at the time was through United Healthcare, but unfortunately I do not know the specific plan details."
13367,"Male, 35, got it and my doc got insurance to cover it bc I have multiple new partners regularly :)"
13368,My doctor recently got his and he is in his 50s. 
13369,"It is available for males, I just got my third shot of it yesterday "
13370,Agree with all of this. I got the vaccines too late and had abnormal Paps and all that scary nonsense. But I just think it’s a little strange that a colposcopy was that painful for her. In my experience and from all I’ve read it’s really mild cramping that is taken care of with like one dose of Advil 
13371,"Same, my mother told me “You shouldn’t be doing that stuff anyway” when my pediatrician told her about the vaccine. Completely neglecting the nature of human beings seems to be a common trend in a lot of parents. 
"
13372,"As a parent I'm often surprised that other adults knowingly create human mammals that will obviously develop into sexual adults, and still want to act like it's unnatural or ""bad.""
You created a sexual mammal! Just like yourself! 
If you're not mature enough to handle a mammal child like a fully functional human being, or adult enough to teach your child how to care for their own body that you created, don't have one! The best way to teach your children responsibility and safety is to educate them on caring for all their bodily needs, sex safety being one.

/Rant
"
13373,My mom completely switched doctors for my brother when it was suggested he take the shot. Just a bunch of sticking her fingers and her ears and going “LALALLALALA”
13374,"Oof. Well, you can still get vaccinated. I’m sorry your parents are like this. "
13375,I’m pretty sure that’s a different wart virus. It may effect humans. And be a papilloma virus. But it’s a different strain than the sexually transmitted ones we vaccinate against. So don’t worry. But get the vaccine to prevent the other kind. Stuff your silly parents!
13376,"I feel you about side effects and being worried about the way big pharma hawks it, but they do that with everything.  The vaccine came out right after I was diagnosed with cervical cancer as an 18 year old. It was early enough that I was able to rid myself of it with a series of surgeries, but it worried my parents half to death. I would suggest doing all your research and making a decision sooner than later. "
13377,When I was young I didn't even really know what the vaccinations I was getting were for. I doubt your daughter's thought process would be as you describe. 
13378,"Hey there!!

I’m an NP and wanted to clear up something you’re concerned about. Studies have shown that the children who have received the vaccine do not have sex earlier, more sex, or increased incidence of teen pregnancy. 

Please do everything you can to protect her. You can teach and educate her to make the right decisions, but at the end of the day you also want to do things to protect her in case she makes “wrong” decisions, correct?

As a health care provider and someone who has dealt with HPV, I strongly advocate for the vaccine. I don’t wish what I’ve had to go through on anyone. 

Please feel free to post here or message me if you have more questions!"
13379,"Basically zero meaningful side effects, but it is a ""sore in the shoulder afterward"" shot. Way better than cancer, though."
13380,"This vaccine is not advertised in Australia, but most Australians get the vaccine. Not agreeing with the marketing isn't a good enough reason to risk your child getting cervical cancer. "
13381,"There have been tons of long-term followup studies on both adverse effects and the efficacy of the vaccine. Definitely ask your docs about those! There are remarkably few adverse side-effects, both serious and otherwise. "
13382,"side effects from rxlist and it is stated these aren't all of them, rx list seeks to have an agenda to make this vaccine sound as appealing as possible and minimize risks.

Patient Information (Source:FDB)

SIDE EFFECTS: Redness, itching, swelling, bruising, and pain at the injection site may occur. Fever and headache may also occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.

Infrequently, temporary symptoms such as fainting/dizziness/lightheadedness, vision changes, numbness/tingling, or seizure-like movements have happened after vaccine injections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have any of these symptoms soon after receiving an injection. Sitting or lying down may relieve symptoms.

13383,"Not more pleasant than being paralyzed or having seizures though!
Should be wrapping it up anyways to protect from other stds."
13384,"It is incredibly disheartening to see how many parents have this attitude. They'd rather risk their children's safety in the event they disobey, or worse are the victim of an assault, than protect them just in case.  

I understand, but still disagree with the side effect argument, but the whole premarital sex argument just infuriates me."
13385,[deleted]
13386,"Any age from 9, but early teens is ideal! I'm 25 and just got it, but because I'm older, it cost more. Get it while you're young! 

I don't want to scare you but my step mom died because she didn't get this vaccine (and got cervical cancer from HPV). In this day and age, it is absolutely necessary. And remember, condoms don't protect against HPV, so this is the only safe way to protect yourself. 

So yes, you should absolutely get it. 

Tell your mom that even though you aren't planning on having sex for a long time, you found out that you're at the ideal age to receive the vaccine, and should get it now. Alternatively, try to talk to your doctor privately and ask them to convince your mom.

Remember, this is not about being sexual or dirty, this is a cancer vaccine. "
13387,My mother (this was super awesome of her) paid for the vaccine before it was free in my country. Her attitude- Prevent cancer in my child? Shut up and take my money! 
13388,"I’m in the same boat you are, except I got the vaccine as a youngster and still contracted the highest risk strands— 16 and 18. :/ 

I actually work in the field of medical research so I’m not criticizing the vaccine..just giving perspective that may put your mom’s mind at ease. Hope you’re doing well!"
13389,"Seriously? This thread reminded me, I wanted to take care of it this year but that sounds ridiculous, did you try going through your GP for the recommendation?"
13390,"I'd agree. My friend who just got diagnosed was precancerous for years, but they repeatedly refused to do more extensive tests until she turned 25 (this year). She got a biopsy (or some such procedure) as soon as she could, and it came back cancerous."
13391,"Thank you for sharing your experience! I'm glad you are not dead or dying :) I totally think that more people should do their research, and discuss their options with their doctors. "
13392,"Thank you for sharing your experience! I'm glad you are not dead or dying :) I totally think that more people should do their research, and discuss their options with their doctors. "
13393,"As I understand, it's unlikely you were tested for hpv as there's not much of a way for you to test for it. If one of you has it asymptomatically, this would prevent the other from getting it or from reinfecting each other if your body happens to clear it out. And yeah, there's no harm in getting it unless you can't get vaccines for medical reasons."
13394,"NP here. There is no test for men for HPV unless you have active lesions of some sort. 

I would say....it couldn’t hurt. It’s never something you want to think about, but life can throw curve balls...it’s best to be as protected and prepared as possible, IMHO. "
13395,"Ditto. Was vaccinated about decade before I first had sex. Normal paps for years until April of this year :( the strains I have are 16 and 18. Had biopsies and it came back mild so now it’s just watch and wait. 

Hope you’re okay! "
13396,"It's very common, for whatever reason Gardasil was mostly advertised as being for girls. But several strains of HPV can cause different types of cancers and also genital warts so men should absolutely get the shots as well"
13397,that’s fucked up
13398,Tell them you already are 👹

13402,"Yes! If your health insurance company doesn’t cover it, check out the Gardisil website for patient assistance and/or check with your local health department. "
13403,"M 26 when I got it. Yes. Although I've heard stories of some insurance companies not covering it for adult men. Mine, United Healthcare, covered the entire cost"
13404,The autism crap was faked by a dude. He literally made up data. What a tool! 
13405,"The side effects are so rare, and nothing compared to what HPV can do to you. "
13406,"Yes! It's even free if you get the first vaccine (it's a series of three, spaced out over a few months) before your 27th birthday. I started mine when I was 26 and by the time I had the third one I was 27, but it was all free.

Word of warning, my GP was confused and thought it was only for people under 26 because the wording was a little ambiguous, but it's definitely inclusive of 26 year olds."
13407,WOW good for New Zealand!
13408,What is the allergen in this vaccine that people react to?
13409,"There's nothing different between this vaccine and many other ones, afaik. Are you just trying to be a scaremonger?"
13410,"I’m a nurse practitioner and I can say with 100% certainty that allergic reactions are rare with this. 

Can you post some sort of article or something regarding where you’re getting this information? “Making sure you’re not allergic” to “this type of vaccine” has no medical warrant that I’m aware of. "
13411,"Wrong. :/
I was vaccinated very young but still contracted the 2 highest risk strains—16 and 18. I’ve had to have biopsies and so far everything is low grade, so just watching and waiting for now. Were hopeful that the vaccine may help my body fight the virus easier, but well just have to wait and see"
13412,"True. So women especially because its easier to find in them, make sure you get screened regularly."

i had a bad and painful experience after my first shot and i think i had nerve damage. my doctor canceled the other 2 rounds.

13418,Thank you for sharing this.
13419,"It depends on how old...

The vaccine hasn’t been studied in people in their 30s and 40s and older AFAIK for 2 reasons: 1. Many people already have the virus/several strains of it. 2. The studies done on the vaccine have shown that the younger you get it, the better immunity you are able to build against the virus. "
13420,"Sure, if you want to get charged out the ass for it.

I got the full course, at 18, for free.

Two years ago a young doctor convinced my husband to get the vaccine, and did not inform him that it wasn't covered by insurance. After the first shot, we were billed nearly a thousand fucking dollars. *For one of three shots.* Never went back."
13421,"There is no HPV test for men. So you were not tested for it. You were tested for other STI’s. 

Also, condoms do not protect well, if at all, against HPV. "
13422,"You might as well. You're not required of course so there's no ""have to"" but say if one of them cheats it's better to just be protected "
13423,"Sure, rape happens and can spread disease."
13424,"If there were zero previous partners and zero chance of infidelity, then there's no risk of sexually transmitted HPV, but 1) most sexually active people contract at least one strain of HPV within a couple years of becoming sexually active, and 2) many people cheat, so it seems worth it to me from an odds perspective, even in a sexually conservative context."
13425,"My husband (31) and I (F29) are each others only sexual partners, and we've been together since we were teens (18 and 17). We got married at 25 and 23. I got the shots when I was 24/25. I figured it wouldn't hurt, and I might as well get it while insurance covers it, and who knows what will happen in the future. You don't have to get it, but if it's available to you and insurance covers it (or you can afford it) it wouldn't hurt. Even if you've had previous partners, you may not have been exposed to all the strains."
13426,That's actually pretty infuriating. It still would be if you weren't a virgin because there's always a chance you haven't been exposed to one of the strains yet.

13431,"A few things:

1. RxList does not have an agenda of any sort. Claims like that need lots of evidence. 

2. The HPV vaccine is no more dangerous than other vaccines. 

3. According to the best available data, there was NO DIFFERENCE in serious adverse reactions between vaccine (0.8%) and placebo (0.8%) in the whole study cohort (n=29,323)

4. According to the best available data, there was NO DIFFERENCE in adverse reactions related to systematic autoimmune diseases between the vaccine and placebo. 

5. According to the best available data, there was no more than a 2% difference in any adverse event between the vaccine and placebo. 

This vaccine is incredibly safe. There is no evidence that the vaccine can cause seizures or paralysis.

These sorts of questions are better asked of them."

13436,"Dude I am in the exact same position. I likely got hpv from a women who had it years ago but had clean Pap smears for years. Went down on her and 1year later I still have sore throat symptoms. From what I have gathered, only a very small percentage of hpv actually manifests it’s self as cancer, and the vaccine covers variants that cover 96% of all cancer.  In over words, the few strains covered by the vaccine account for nearly all the cancers related to hpv. 
I am not aware of hpv testing for men in the mouth or orthopharnyx where cancer is most likely to occur. This is incredibly frustrating as women have Pap smears. I have been told by basically every doctor that there is basically nothing we can do except sleep and eat well, avoid tobacco and alcohol and hope our immune system fights it off. 

I have heard that getting the vaccine is a good thing even if you likely have a strain of hpv for the following reasons. 
It helps your body build antibodies to help fight off the virus if you happen to be reinfected later. I’ve also heard it can have therapeutic affects for people already infected by the virus. I saw an article where they used the vaccine to treat a skin cancer caused by hpv. The body created antibodies which helped shrink the lesion. 

My concern is that the vaccine would cause my throat symptoms to get worse "
13437,"No one knows for sure!! It's up to you to weigh the financial costs versus the potential benefits. I think that if you can afford it, get it. 

 To figure out whether or not it's effective for someone who has already been exposed, they look for indicator of past/current infections. There are those who have no detectable HPV DNA (no infection in cells - this is what the HPV test it), and those who are positive for antibodies (evidence for exposure). Sometimes these groups overlap. The punchline is, the vaccine does show efficacy (25-75%, depending on the study) in some who have the antibodies, but very little/no efficacy in those who test positive for the HPV DNA. It's hard to say in your case, because 1. the studies are poor for males, 2. there isn't really an HPV test for males. 

Even if you never have sex with anyone else again, the benefit will be great or equal to 0. I'm willing to bet my life on the fact that getting the vaccine will not increase your risk of developing HPV-associated cancer (and I rarely say this). There is absolutely no evidence to suggest this is the case, and no conceivable way biologically for this to happen. 

I don't know of any other ways to prevent HPV-related side effects such as cancer.

Edited to add: obviously a better person to ask is your physician."
13453,"Because you haven't had sex yet, and likely haven't been exposed, you are in the demographic that it is most beneficial for. 

As for commonality, it should be given in adolescence, but many parents opt not to vaccinate their kids, especially if they are adamantly against premarital sex. Your doctor likely has the records to know if you've already received the vaccine."
13454,"* HPV is transmitted sexually and causes various cancers in both men and women. It is most known for its link to cervical cancer

* Men can carry it without symptoms and there is no test for it in men. Therefore no way to know if men have it until the emergence of symptoms or cancer. Men are often the ones who are told they don't need the vaccine, which is why I will harp on this point so hard. Just because men don't have a cervix does not mean that they cannot carry and transmit HPV.

* The vaccine prevents some of the strains that cause the most cancers. 

* If you are under 25 and/or a virgin, and are medically able, get it. You are in the group where it is most efficient. 

* If you are sexually active, try to get it and speak with your physician about it. Unfortunately, it is apparently much harder to get if you are both sexually active and over 25, doubly so if you are male This isn't because the vaccine has increased risks when you reach those criteria but because you were likely already exposed and the vaccine loses efficiency. I'd still explore all of your options. You very well may not have been exposed to all strains, and there is no evidence of danger if you get the vaccine. 

* for any other questions, speak to your physician. They will know more than some random stranger on the internet, and you can actually look at their qualifications.

13456,"Even if you discount the link to cancers in men, and for the sake of hypotheticals say they don't exist, it would still irritate me that the vaccine isn't recommended for us. By considering the vaccine only for women, we are completely ignoring half of the potential carriers, and preventing people from carrying HPV in the first would only help women in the long run, especially those who either can't be vaccinated or the vaccine was ineffective on for some reason.

Even the ""if you're sexually active, you are likely to have already been exposed"" argument rubs me the wrong way. We are essentially saying ""you're likely  already an asymptomatic carrier, but we can't know for sure since there is no test. So instead we wont even try to protect you from strains you might not have already contracted, we'd rather just let you carry the disease "" although a lot of that probably also has to do with the fact that the trials participants only went up to about age 26 or so. Maybe there's more to it that medical professionals know and I don't.  I sure hope there is because if there isn't it seems like negligence on the part of healthcare providers.

When my pap and biopsy came back with level 2 precancerous cells, I was given a choice. Because I was so young, I had the option to wait it out to see if my immune system would take care of it. The doc at the time said that too many surgeries were being done on young, healthy women, and it was likely their own body would take care of it. Previously the recommended age to start pap was 18 or when sexually active. They pushed it to 21 regardless of sexual activity.

13470,"Sometimes, there are different versions of a vaccine (against shingles is one example, HPV another), and there are definitely some controversies as to how the government decides which one to fund. This is in part because making vaccines is an expensive endeavour, and getting governments to pay for their version is a large part of how they make their money back. 

However, we need to be conscious to separate these controversies from the question of whether or not the vaccines themselves work on a biological level.

There are studies out there performed by scientists and doctors who have no ""skin in the game"" so to speak. The evidence is overwhelming in multiple countries, over multiple years, that the vaccine is excellent at preventing HPV-related cancers caused by the strains that the vaccine is designed to protect against. These studies are very very very hard to fake, since they are performed by different scientists in different countries, and are reviewed by yet another batch of scientists before they are published and accepted as fact. Therefore, logistically, faking them is nearly impossible. Also, scientists typically like to argue about everything, and it takes a lot to convince them and to get them to agree on anything ;) The fact that there is overwhelming agreement on the effectiveness of vaccines is an excellent sign "

There is no *medical* age limit for the vaccine.  However, there is an insurance age limit; typically they won't pay for it if you're over 26 or so (varies).  

Am middle-age guy.  I had the Gardisil-quadvalent (4 most common HPV variants, something like 90%+ coverage) several years ago, and it cost me $425 out of pocket for the 3 shots.    Last year I went back and badgered them into giving me the new Gardilsil-9 version (something like 98% coverage) as soon as they had it available, and it was just under $1000.  

Just pay.  The risk is real, the prevention is effective, and the peace of mind is worth it.  And next to the potential cost of *any* cancer treatment, the cost instantly becomes comparatively trivial.
"

I cramped the entire day and night afterwards, and I think it took a week to feel completely better. I can actually feel the scar on my cervix from where they took the biopsy.
Luckily, my pap smear came back HPV negative this year, because I'm not sure that I could have done that again.
As a weird aside (and totally probably TMI) they only did a biopsy, but I wonder if they actually removed all the abnormal cells, because after recovery I produced a lot more lubrication during sex and no longer spotted after sex."

13533,"I do want to add, however, that it is still possible to get one of the dangerous strains even after having the vaccine, because according to what my health care provider told me, the vaccine is really only effective for about 10 years. I got it when I was 14 or so, and now, at 27, I had an abnormal pap come back with an HPV-positive result (specifically the 16/18 strain that causes cervical cancer). 

Just wanted to add that, since no one really mentions the fact that the vaccine does not necessarily protect you forever and a booster might be a good idea."
13534,"What is the earliest you can get the vaccine? My son is 4 and I'm due in October with a girl. I'm not going to out and try to have her vaccinated at birth for hpv, but when can I realistically start having it done for them? "

13538,"Let me preface this by saying that the disease I have is in no way related to the vaccine. I have Lyme disease. (Not technically an autoimmune disorder, but it acts like one.) It lays dormant until your immune system gets low, and then decides to hit you. I never had a rash or anything but I was outside as a kid all the time and grew up in a heavily wooded area. I could’ve gotten bit when I was a kid and it didn’t surface until I was 15 because my immune system was pretty solid until then. I’ve read so many stories about this happening with not only Lyme patients but others with autoimmune disorders. It’s just a precautionary thing. Definitely talk to your doctor if it’s something you’re concerned about.

And there it is.  The creator can say something, and even legitimate regret something, and even say that they believe it is or isn't ready.  None of those things dispute the _facts_.

The commercials might be over-the-top because there was at one point a puritanical campaign against them under the mistaken belief among certain segments of religious populations that the HPV vaccine would inevitable lead to promiscuity. Now, any campaign to improve sexual health has to fight that narrative. "
13620,Sorry!!! I totally misread that. 🙈
13621,"They’re similar to other vaccines. The most common for this vaccine is headache. One may also experience fever, nausea, dizziness, and local reactions at the site of injection like redness, pain (I mean...it’s a needle going into a muscle lol), and bruising. 

This vaccine got a bad reputation when it first came out for “making teens pass out”. Research has shown that this reaction can happen, but is associated more with that age group receiving *any* vaccine, not just the HPV vaccine. In fact, there is a vaccine (I believe it’s the Dtap, but don’t quote me on that one), that is attributed to a higher instance of adolescents/teens fainting than HPV. 
"
13622,"9 years old per the drug company, but most practitioners won’t even mention it until age ~12. Some don’t mention at all, sadly enough. If you give the vaccine early like this, your child will only need 2 doses and he/she will be able to build a stronger immunity to the virus. Research has shown that if you get the vaccine later in life, you don’t build the antibodies as well. 

Congratulations on your new addition!"
13623,"I'm not seeing the same thing as you did at WebMD (note, the vaccine people get now is Gardasil 9), but it seems like they're reporting ""Post-Marketing Experience"" as actual established side effects, which is misleading.  If you look at the rxlist site, they attach the proper disclaimer before that:  ""Because these events were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or to establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure."" I.e., the RARE side effects from WebMD likely are not causally related to the vaccine.

All the other side effects listed are side effects of all vaccines.  There's no reason to be more scared of Gardasil than any other vaccine, in fact, it's probably safer than many."
13624,"Yes the HPV and even Herpes tests usually require a sample of a lesion afaik, it doesnt really work through a straight blood test and you'd have to specially ask for it.

13627,Right. And that’s not what I said....but why are you making statements as if this vaccine is unlike any others? 
13628,So what are you allergic to exactly? 
13629,"Holy shit that's what happened to me but they never really looked into like, what happened. I never got checked for neurological or brain tumors or anything. But I get these very odd localized pain in my brain laterally in my cerebellum. This has been happening for years now at random but I've been afraid to get checked for tumors. I've never thought it could be related to the shot but it makes total sense, that part of the brain is motor function and the shot was known to effect motor function and that was my experience sort of after the first one. Wow.

I also started getting this horrible cramping in my toes/feet shortly after the first shot. Again never thought it was linked but now I'm wondering. It's like my foot/toes contort and become extremely stiff and I can't move or break the position and it is extremely painful. Brings me to tears. Sometimes I try to stand and put my weight on it to force them out of the painful locking position or try to pry them out with my hands. It feels sort of like when you're swimming as a kid and you get a foot cramp. But if you look at my toes they're all contorted. Happens less often to my hand. I can't think ifit is only the side I got the shot on. I know the last time it happened to my hand it was.

It's been 10 years since dose 1. Should I bring these things up to a doctor though? Or just the headaches ?

I'm going to paste my experience after the shot though, I'm curious if it's like  what you experienced.

After my first round of the gardasil shot I picked up 1 bag of groceries that was pretty light with the hand of the arm it was injected into, and the feeling I felt I can only describe as how it felt when i was a kid and unplugging something while leaning over my metal framed bed and my finger touched a prong that was still in and I got shocked and grounded for a good amount of time until I was finally able to pry my hand off. It felt like that up my whole arm I got the shot in and the entire left side of my body. I then lost most of my mobility and feeling in my left arm the rest of the day. After that whenever it got cold out ajd i was outsidr or in a car or anything, even bundked up, I would lose feeling in my pinky toe that would spread to the others after time and also in my pinky finger. That lessened over time but I ended up developing raynauds which I believe to be linked."

See, there's a ton of bad information about this.  To clarify:   
- By mid-20s, most people in western population have or had had SOME variant of HPV.    **<--** Most people stop reading here, leading to misunderstandings.... but keep reading:  
- Some HPV infections remain resident, but most HPV infections self-resolve in ~2yrs.   
- Having one variant does not prevent getting another, or prevent re-infection with the same variant.   
- HPV-16 and HPV-18 are known to cause about 70% of HPV-related cancer. Most visible infections that cause warts are other variants (hpv-6 and hpv-9).   The G-4 vaccine covers these four variants.    
- The G-9 vaccine also covers types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which addresses most causes of genital warts and cervical/vaginal cancers.  And hpv-related throat and mouth cancers (of concern for orally-inclined men and women)   
- The vaccines are 99+% effective against those specific strains. Cervarix has been found to provide cross-protection against some additional variants. 

TL;DR:  It's almost always beneficial to get the vaccination if you're sexually active, may be in the future, or may have a new partner in the future. "

Patient Information (Source:FDB)

SIDE EFFECTS: Redness, itching, swelling, bruising, and pain at the injection site may occur. Fever and headache may also occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.

Infrequently, temporary symptoms such as fainting/dizziness/lightheadedness, vision changes, numbness/tingling, or seizure-like movements have happened after vaccine injections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have any of these symptoms soon after receiving an injection. Sitting or lying down may relieve symptoms.

FDA Prescribing Information

Overall Summary Of Adverse Reactions

Headache, fever, nausea, and dizziness; and local injection site reactions (pain, swelling, erythema, pruritus, and bruising) occurred after administration with GARDASIL.

Syncope, sometimes associated with tonic-clonic movements and other seizure-like activity, has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL and may result in falling with injury; observation for 15 minutes after administration is recommended. [SeeWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]

Anaphylaxis has been reported following vaccination with GARDASIL

13681,Thanks for the reply! I'll definitely remember to ask for it as soon as they are able to have it done. 
13682,"Right there, you're wrong.

https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-144456/gardasil-pf-intramuscular/details/list-sideeffects

https://www.rxlist.com/gardasil-side-effects-drug-center.htm#overview

No, those are not side effects of all vaccines.

The reason the web md list I linked above is more extensive than the main web md and rx list postings is because it is the full and complete list of side effects. The disclaimers that are elsewhere state that they are not disclosing the full and complete list of side effects.

It says no where that they aren't from the research trials not on the patient information or FDA information and in fact on rx list the research trials are right below the FDA info I pasted.

Patient reports to their doctor and the vaccine report hotline absolutely matter and should not be discredited. I wish I reported mine, may be I still can. 

Lastly, just because somethings rare doesn't mean it never happens and people shouldn't be aware of it. There's only a 3% chance you'll get pregnant per month but people still use birth control so. 

There's absolutely nothing wrong with being aware of all the potential side effects and risks and making informed decisions and being aware and prepared in case you do start to develop troubling symptoms. The 1 good thing with gardasil is it's 3 doses so if you are going to have adverse reactions you should hopefully have some signs after dose 1 and finish before it gets much worse but even so there is risk for lasting damage. I've shared my experience elsewhere on the thread. While it's rare it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and had I known about the risks I probably wouldn't have gotten the first dose at all.

All I'm doing is sharing my experience and when people are posting incorrect information that there are no side effects, or asking about side effects I am sharing them. I'm sorry the truth doesn't align with your agenda and you feel the need to discredit the facts and invalidate people's experiences because it's not the same as yours. You should consider yourself lucky you were able to get the vaccine without severe side effects, not discredit and devalue those that have."
13683,Thanks! I just called my local CVS and it seems they charge 240 per shot for a total of two shots. I'm doing it
13684,"For those who are unfortunate to end up with the degenerative paralysis disorder GBS, I don't think so.
It is important to be informed of all of the side effects and risks: no matter how rare and infrequent so you are aware and can see early signs, especially with this vaccine, so that if you do develop adverse reactions you can catch it early after the first shot and have time to end the rest before it gets worse."
13685,"I think honestly that the risks don't outweigh the benefits. It is about equal percentage you will end up with cancer causing HPV and a strain that is protected against by the vaccine, as it is to develop these severe symptoms. Everyone in our society is just fixated on cancer. If you just wear a condom and trust your partner, theres no need for this vaccine. Since there's no vaccine for other stds you should be taking measures regardless, so I don't see the need considering these side effects can be pretty severe."
13686,"It is unlike any others because there is not a single vaccine out there can comes even close to being able to prevent cancer. **The rate of adverse effects (including unknown allergies) is also exceedingly rare**, and equal to those who are placebo-treated. The doctor usually makes you stay for 15-30 min after administration anyway, so that they can help you if you do have an allergic reaction. 

Moreover, allergy testing in incredibly unreliable. The chances of being able to predict whether or not you are allergic to a given vaccine is incredibly low. However, good news is that there are very few people who are allergic to vaccines. The chances of you being allergic is even lower if you have been vaccinated under a standardized schedule with no problems. There are some vaccines that are made in eggs, and so people who are allergic to eggs won't be able to get them. For the HPV vaccines, one vaccine is grown in yeast, and another one in insect cells. So if you are allergic to yeast, you might want the other one instead. 

I have gotten certain vaccines that have made me feel like I had the flu. All vaccines have components that help stimulate your immune system so that they can recognize the components of the pathogen that's in the vaccine, and develop a memory response to it. Some of these components are a bit stronger than others, and so those tend to cause more pain than others. The HPV vaccines fall under the category of ""hurt less"" rather than ""hurt more"". 

I'm going to wrap up by saying **I strongly urge everyone to talk to a licensed doctor when considering whether to get a vaccine or not** "
13687,"I wasn't reiterating anything you were trying to say.  I made no statement about vaccines.  I'm saying that ""rare"" is not an absolute."
13688,"Omg im so sorry- that sounds like a lot for you to deal with, especially with the Raynauds popping up. Please keep your hands warm, and don't get too stressed.

If your hands are cramping and contorting, that could be nervous too. A lot of it sounds like nerve symptoms tbh, that's the thing about this shot, lots of women are getting sick after having it but it's still being pushed on our kids. My child won't have it, but he's fully immunized.

All I know, it's really unfair. 

You've obviously am autoimmune condition post vaccine but doctor's will shrug it off like it was going to happen anyway. "
13689,"A parent's rights on how they treat their children are not absolute. You are, for example, required to feed, house, clothe, and educate your child, the reason for this is society has agreed that your child's rights to some basic needs outweigh your rights to raise them as you see fit.

And it is my business. If you want to burn your house down, there's a reasonable argument that you should be able to, it's your property, what you do with it isn't my business. The reason you can't is the risk it puts your neighbor's house at, so their rights to safety outweigh your property rights.

Not vaccinating your child puts them at considerable risk that's out of their control, and your child getting sick puts others who can't get vaccinated at considerable risk. Both of these risks are significant enough that to do outweigh your personal rights on how you raise your child."
13690,">very real

Lmao sure. 

And yes, you are."
13691,Okay this was the answer I wasn't sure of. Thank you. 
13692,So there is a wart that can happen? I'm so confused. 
13693,"Whatever distinction you want to bear on ""public health"" and ""medicine"" they have no relevance here. For HPV vaccination the general advice from state authorities contradicts the general advice given by the OP."
13694,"> None of those public health recommendations mentioned cited safety concerns in groups outside of their recommended list.

If you mean there was no evidence of danger, that'd be correct. But there was an implied lack of evidence for safety (and efficacy) among (at least) one group outside their recommended list. Namely for males over 45 .... 

> there are no theoretical concerns that the efficacy or safety of this vaccine in males up to the age of 45 years will differ significantly from that in younger males.

You:
> I'd say my position expands rather than contradicts the health organization recommendations.

If your recommendations are materially different, which they are, from the health organization recommendations, then they contradict them.

13701,"Hysterical quote from their link:

""One special fear of theirs is that the public might discover the fact that most vaccines are contaminated with a number of known and yet-to-be discovered viruses, bacteria, viral fragments, and DNA/RNA fragments.""

If things are contaminated with yet-to-be discovered viruses (let alone the idea of lab created vaccines being 'contaminated'), then how do they get there? Who is verifying this? How do you prove the existence of an undiscovered virus? The link to the full article is gone and I'm devastated xD"

13704,"Same. I asked about it before I was 25, but I was told I wasn't eligible for coverage (according to guidelines, I actually would have been.) I've also asked about it since, but could never afford that much in one go, and I was told that they won't give it to people over 27 at all, whether I can pay for it or not."
13705,"So, what is that under American health care? $2.5k"
13706,"shit

$80 x3 is still cheap as shit."

Gardasil was like $180 a shot for me when I got it a couple of years ago.

13709,it should only be ~$80 or so
13710,"I guess I'm thinking more along the lines of possibly getting the shot. I never considered it when I was younger, having close to zero interest in sex, and too embarrassed to even ever talk about it with anyone, much less my doctor. Now I'm 30, I'm a bit more interested in the idea of actually being a sexual person (*scandalous*, I know!), and it seems too late for me to do anything about it. I'll ask my doctor and try to find out what insurance might cover (I work at a hospital, so my insurance is pretty damn good), but I can't afford anything super expensive. 

Thank you so much for the info - I'm so embarrassed I didn't know most of this stuff when I was younger. "
13711,"Yes, please, let's all misconstrue some innocuous statement into a slight against poor people. Because that just doesn't happen often enough."
13712,So you were still within the recommended time frame and why it was covered. I'm sure I wouldn't be covered at 30.
13713,"It's not fear mongering it's the truth.
And no not all vaccines have a seizure like effect or anaphylaxis, or GBS and all of these other things. 
While it may be a small percentage and most people get it ok, that doesn't devalue or discredit those that can't. It's great that it worked for you, but for some people they will have these severe reactions and people need to be aware because there's no saying you won't be unlucky. 
The good thing with gardasil is if you're going to have adverse reactions you should know by the first dose and stop before getting the other 2 and it shouldn't be as bad."
13714,Yes. The studies that have been performed show that the vaccine is most effective when given prior to being exposed to the virus.
13715,"To be clear, I'm not suggesting you vaccinate her before the CDC recommendations. But if you wait until you think she's ready to have sex, it may be too late. 

All I'm saying is don't put this off until it's too late. "
13716,You’re correct. It might be Tdap.
13717,Welp this is scary as fuck not sure what to do now 
13718,You’re so welcome. I love hearing about parents being proactive with this!
13719,"Thanks for that more detailed link, sorry I couldn't find it earlier... and I haven't seen your comment of your personal experience, but I'll try to go find it.  I stand corrected until I can go read the medical journals on it, which probably won't be for a day or so."
13720,Woo! Worth it. 
13721,"Going through trying to find your experience with the vaccine (sorry I didn't go looking for that earlier, it's a huge thread), but here I have to correct you for being wrong.  Condoms don't prevent HPV transmission, and you can get HPV from non-sexual skin-to-skin contact."
13722,"I know that Irish folk tend to get raynauds, but it never happened until after the vaccine and the first year or so it felt the same way I felt when I lost the feeling after the shot. Years later it felt a bit different and I could see that my fingers just were a different color than others and had almost no blood in them. Now it's been 10 years and I don't get these effects as much as I did in the beginning.

What can I do to find out if I do have an autoimmune or neurological condition? Should I tell a doctor all of this ?

I remember my doctor was just PISSED her fill in gave it. I came when she was away with my dad, I think for a physical for school. And the full in suggested it and we were like, okay sure? Then we went back not long after, I don't remember what for, and my main doctor was LIVID the fill in pushed it on us. She said she has no right pushing vaccines on her patients and doing long term things without her consent. She said there wasn't enough research and they pushed the vaccine early without extensive and proper RCTs. She said She was concerned about the long term side effects which were aren't yet aware of. I told her how I got the electrical shooting feeling after and she just shook her head and crossed out the whole rest of the doses.

Then my mom got really mad my dad took me and let me get it lol.
We really just didn't know and at the time it came out in 2008, they weren't disclosing the neurological/paralysis effects. They actually didn't tell us ant of the side effects or risks. We didn't get a piece if paper about the vaccine. Nothing. So that's why I'm sharing what rhey are now, becuase there s a huge push on this vaccine and honestly irs weird to me.
Also 
But then right after my first dose it came out all over the news. Girls in wheelchairs, collapsing, not being able to walk, having seizures: all after the vaccine.
Now we see GBS is listed as an infrequent rare and severe side effect and ""seizure like movements"" is listed right under your standard dizzy/nausea so.

I think honestly that the risks don't outweigh the benefits. It is about equal percentage you will end up with cancer causing HPV and a strain that is protected against by the vaccine, as it is to develop these severe symptoms. Everyone in our society is just fixated on cancer. If you just wear a condom and trust your partner, theres no need for this vaccine. Since there's no vaccine for other stds you should be taking measures regardless, so I don't see the need."
13723,"  Says who? The parents of children who have never had a bad reaction to vaccines? Is that who you're speaking of?  What about the children who became massively ill because of vaccines? Do they have matter in the 3 paragraphs that you wrote? Do they matter at all? Are you bother acknowledging them? Truth is, it is a hard decision, but because of ALL of the factors involved being so risky and being that there is no guarantee how my child will react, then there shouldn't be this huge stigma against parents who do no vaccinate. 
 Millions of parents only wish they can go back in time and never inject their child.    And millions find no problem with them at all.  What I choose is truly my decision and no I'm not burning a damn house down.  It's not that cut and dry. "
13724,"A lot of common warts, including ones that do not involve the genitals, are from HPV. These types do not cause cancer 

Cancer types are called high-risk HPV. It’s not uncommon for someone to contract more than one type of HPV.

Anyway, what is worse, saying I hope an anti-vaxxers kid gets ill or actually being an anti-vaxxer and ***actually*** putting the life of a child and others at risk.             
Thats the difference here, I may use some nasty words but I would never actually hurt a child. "
13726,I am enlightened.

13728,"Did you not read the article I posted?

Both of my parents had cancer before the link between HPV and oral cancer was made, and my SO had vulvar cancer before the link between HPV and vulvar cancer was definitive, however the oncologist said that it appeared consistent with HPV. Neither of my parents were in high risk groups for throat or oral cancer.

Yes, *possible*. However, it’s so *probable* that you’re being kind of ridiculous. Gardasil 4 protects against two of the cancer causing strains that cause 70% of all cervical cancers, And as well Gardasil 9 protects against a further 20%. "

13735,"Well, *it wasn't.*"
13736,Which country?
13737,"Where I live, California, the cheapest option if you're not covered through insurance is through Costco and it's $175-ish per shot. My doctor told me it costs them more to order it than Costco charges.  

She sent me this link at goodrx with prices: 

[https://www.goodrx.com/gardasil?drug-name=gardasil](https://www.goodrx.com/gardasil?drug-name=gardasil)"
13738,You must not be from america where there's basically zero regulation on healthcare. 
13739,"Thanks.   A thousand bucks is still a thousand bucks.  But otoh, that's 6 months of car insurance for a young driver who just got their license in my city.  Do they wanna drive or take the risk of driving without insurance?  That's the price."
13740,It's simply not as easy as 'just pay' for a LOT of people out there. 
13741,"Yes it is. It’s all about risk vs benefit and anyone can have an anaphylactic reaction to just about anything at any time. There is also the placebo effect so if people overly focus on unlikely rare possible side effects, funnily enough they tend to experience some of those side effects. It’s not rocket science. 🤷‍♀️"
13742,"I was going to start it at 11-12. I teach that age, and typically they start and finish the series in middle school. I just see it as another vaccination, not as a milestone in her sexual development."
13743,"You should notice after 1 shot if some things wrong. I did and the doctor canceled the rest. I also have a lot of bad reactions to vaccines and they don't last on me. I had to redo my chicken pox one when I was 24 and the site turned completely red, was horribly itchy, and was flaking off. I had to get dtap again a few months ago, my doctor thought it would be good because I am a clinical psuch student and sometimes have hospital placements; and my muscle was hard swollen and extremely painful. I slept an insane amount after. Took almost a week for the pain in my arm to go down, and I had to put a heat pack on it for over an hour every night to get relief. 
I'm also small, 105 lbs. I don't think the full doses are good for my body. 

As for the gardasil shot, I shared my experience in my own comment on this thread so take a look for that.

I remember it being in the news quite a bit in 2008-2009 the GBS effects which was really scary. I think if I continued with the full dose of all 3 shots I probably would have had that  considering I had loss of mobility, severe pain, and weird temperature related numbness and pain in my extremities on the left side of my body following my first shot."
13744,"At the bottom of the rx list after the FDA it discusses different trials.

My experience matches pretty well with those who developed GBS and other degenerative mobility and nerve disorders and paralysis after that which were all over the news after it released to the public.
And you can't say that it was just a coincidence, psychosomatic, etc.
Because these cases they literally walked out and had problems that day or that week."
13745,"I just had a look - Irish have a 10% chance of developing raynauds, that's significant.
All you can do now is focus on bringing your body back up to health internally. 

Personally, I would start with researching ""leaky gut"" and how it pertains to your situation, eliminating any food sensitivity or intolerances. And jumping 100% onto the Wahls protocol- which is a modified paleo that focuses on veggies and fruit with small amounts of meats etc.

There's a lady on their fb page who has reversed symptoms of (not cured) sclerotherapy, raynauds etc etc. I use it on my medical issues too and it works. Doctors may or may not give you answers you seek, can always try if you feel it to help you but definitely Start healing within"
13746,"Millions, eh? Are we talking about autism? "
13747,"Again, I'm pro vaccination.  I think that it should be criminal to not vaccinate.  I have a baby, he can't get the measles shot for a few months yet, and there is an outbreak due to bad decisions out there.

I get it.

I'm also telling you that we have a code of conduct on this sub.  You can disagree all you ant with an opinion, but you may not attack the person - if you want to remain in this sub, that is.

13750,"Or look up LEEP, that's the fun you potentially get to go through when the colposcopy result is bad. It's not that fun to smell them cutting/burning off chunks of your cervix with an electrified wire, especially when the nurse only brought up half as much numbing agent as requested by the gynecologist and the gynecologist decides to make do with what's in front of him. It's also very awkward when the gynecologist grabs the speculum and yanks it around roughly to reposition your body between burning off chunks of cervix instead of simply asking you to tilt your hips in the necessary direction.

I didn't actually feel the colposcopy at all, but the LEEP was rough.

For anyone who is afraid they'll get this gynecologist, he's retired now so hopefully you don't have to experience this kind of roughness."
13751,Grand total of $240? That's doable over 18 months. One shot every 6 months?

13753,"I believe you - doctors are absolutely shitty at telling you when stuff is covered or not, and often they don’t actually know. 

So that other people don’t get screwed like this - it’s important to ask how much, and ask if they’re sure if they tell you it’s covered. If it’s too expensive, you can go to a planned parenthood or somewhere else for the shot. "

The side effects listed are not placebo, they are from the vaccine.

These are the side effects of the vaccine, not placebo group; and your comments don't change that:

Patient Information (Source:FDB)

SIDE EFFECTS: Redness, itching, swelling, bruising, and pain at the injection site may occur. Fever and headache may also occur. If any of these effects persist or worsen, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.

Infrequently, temporary symptoms such as fainting/dizziness/lightheadedness, vision changes, numbness/tingling, or seizure-like movements have happened after vaccine injections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have any of these symptoms soon after receiving an injection. Sitting or lying down may relieve symptoms.

As for the raynauds, never had it til the month I got the vaccine and it felt initially the way it felt the day I got the vaccine. It was very bad the few years after the vaccine but got a lot better in recent years."

13762,how is this cheap. Are you people serious? The last time I rented it was 300 for a 2 bedroom apt. There is no rental property anywhere near here that will charge 1650 a month but your referring to it as cheap. How do you live that way?

13767,Calgary. I may be misremembering but I'm reasonably certain it cost me less.
13768,"It's rough to be a patient and get blindsided by costs like that. Doctors are shitty about it, but it's not like we always or even often know ahead of time whether it's covered or not--because if we did, we would tell you, or we would choose something else.

 I order something for a patient that is more than reasonable and I think they *need* and I don't find out until after the insurance company rejects it. This can be days later. Then they send us a small mountain of paperwork that I can waste oodles of time filling out on appeal just to have them reject it anyway. So then I can can choose an alternative and they reject that, too. Cue the cycle of paperwork that can take weeks if not longer until its sorted out or until someone gives up. Meanwhile, no one is helping the patient.

I have a few patients in the hospital today that I wasted hours dealing with this nonsense and the sequelae of it. One guy, for example, could *easily* leave the hospital, go home and take a stupid pill for a few days. But his insurance company won't cover it, or the alternative and he would very quickly become sicker and possibly die if I sent him home without it immediately available. This pill costs about $18 for each dose. Total cost of treatment: $90. As small as this seems, it's not something the gentleman can afford on one day.

Meanwhile, his retarded insurance company would rather spend *thousands* of dollars keeping him in the hospital and won't even take further action on this until Monday, which is two days away, when I may have the privilege of fighting them again over the paltry sum of $54.

Meanwhile, I was supposed to finish work at 5pm but didn't leave until after midnight because I tried to sort things like this out by the end of the business day and pushed off all of the essential, yet only slightly less time-sensitive stuff until afterwards. And for all of my hours and the case manager and the pharmacists who wasted their time on this, we have accomplished absolutely nothing.

Please don't judge your doctors too harshly--even though an astonishingly high percentage of physicians have been scientifically proven to be ~~huge~~ *enormous* assholes, we are enormous assholes who care about you. Yet like you, we are largely powerless against the system.
"
13769,"What's shitty is that you never know how much medical stuff costs until you get the bill. The insurance and your provider have disclaimers saying that just because they say something is covered, doesn't mean it is."
13770,"Each insurance company negotiates separately with each HR department of each company.

Sure, you have ""United insurance"" but there are ?1000 different companies that have ""United Insurance"" in the area.  Each has different drugs covered, different copays, different co-insurances, even different specialist networks and different hospitals you need to go to for lower costs.  It would take your doctor's office an hour to track down what your actual version of insurance will cover.  So, do you want to sit there for an hour while they call?  Before you answer that you need to know when you call the insurance company they have a disclaimer that whatever they tell you might not be accurate and you mights still be responsible to pay.

Let's take Gardasil.   Your doctor might make $15 each time that shot is given.   The costs from the pharmaceutical companies are huge for any vaccine invented in the last 20 years.  And they go up every year.  And by far more than inflation.  Blaming your doctor for getting socked with a $300 charge for the vaccine is unfair.  The doctor paid for the vaccine and then gave it to you.  If you walk away from the bill, they lose $250 they paid for the vaccine and the $50 they wanted to keep the lights on and the employees paid at the office as well as their own income.

The blame is, on the surface, on the insurance companies.  They are out to make the most money they possibly can and that is accomplished by...not paying for shit whenever they can get away with it.

The real blame is on the government.  Insurance companies in the US do what they do because they have no laws in place telling them they can't do that.  They aren't there for your benefit.  They need to do everything they can to provide shareholder returns. When regulated properly, there is an even playing field where they all have to follow certain rules, it works better.  Not perfect but better.  Sadly, no real regulation gets through the government anymore."
13771,Saying it's always just so easy to hand over the money is ignorant. Not everyone has that kind of money to spend. 
13772,"Stop reposting your crap all over the place will you? And I don’t understand science? I’m a vet tech and my husband is an specialist orthopaedic surgeon. Ok its a reverse placebo effect in that its a negative effect instead of a positive one, but its similar in that its induced by a preconceived beliefs or ideas regarding the substance.  The power of the mind is incredible hence why I can’t stand fear mongering. If you tell people that x,y and z could happen to them if they take this pill/injection etc a huge percentage of them will experience that. In fact a far greater percentage than what is experienced in a double blind RCT. Anyway, have a read of this article:

13785,"it isn't fear mongering or crap...it's sharing the legitimate risks and side effects as posted on medical sites, discussed in the news through patient reports, and in the vaccine info itself. so i see nothing wrong with correcting people who say there are no side effects, or sharing the side effects with those asking.

i'm sorry you are in denial about the facts because it doesn't fit in with your agenda that this is a totally risk free vaccine. while the risk may be small, there is no saying any one will not be one of the unlucky few for whatever reason has the severe ones.

and ""reverse placebo effects"" absolutely do not get listed medically, nor are they that severe. 

and vet techs are hardly scientific lol. you don't publish, read, or conduct scientific research.

13787,Can confirm. It’s still 3 if you start after 14 yo. 
13788,Time to shhh now. 🤫 You’re just being silly and not recognising the words “risk vs benefit”. I thought layman’s terms wouldn’t be too hard for you to understand but I was wrong. Sorry 😥 Just so you know the risks and side effects have been minor and rare. Nowhhere did i say they dont exist. That’s the crux of the whole issue of risk v benefit. Bye bye. Take care and don’t spread your anti vax fears to others on the internet please. Thank you. 😚
13789,"you shush.
i'm sharing the risks, you're focusing on the benefits. neither one cancels the other. i'm not arguing what the benefits are, so why are you arguing what the risks are?

i had some of these side effects, my doctor canceled the next 2 doses, and believed i would have developed GBS if i continued it.
rare doesn't mean never.

some people will have these effects. many don't. but that doesn't mean the effects aren't real and a risk because they're rare.

it's rare a plane will crash but we still wear belts and get taught the oxygen mask useage before every flight.

it's rare you will get side effects, but you should be informed about them and people shouldn't be pretending there are none because all that does is make it more risky because people aren't aware and if they start to develop some may not realize it is from the vaccine and continue the dose without telling their doctor and end up really hurt.

you're not helping anyone by debating what the risks and side effects are, and at worst you're harming people.

i'm not an anti-vaxxer. i just believe people should be informed and aware of what the risks and side effects are of every medicine they take before they take it so they can choose for themselves if risks outweigh the benefits rather than be ignorant, misinformed, and in denial about the risks. "
13790,So are you posting the side effects of aspirin everywhere? I see so you’re not anti vaccinations just pro making everyone afraid to have them then. Hmmmm interesting psychosis 🧐🙄
13791,"Oh and your plane analogy is wrong. The seat belts and O2 masks are more like having the vaccine. What you do is more like sending people videos of planes crashing when they’re online looking at buying their ticket, and telling them they have to watch them over and over until they get on the plane. All it does is create unnecessary anxiety and fear as it’s more than likely not going to happen. Just like the side effects from vaccines or other medications. Please tell me you don’t think the MMR vaccine causes autism do you? 😳"
13792,"no because this isn't a post about asprin. 
this is a post about gardasil, and i am sharing my experience and to those who bring up side effects what the side effects are. sorry if that upsets you."
13793,"no i've already said i'm not an antivaxxer. the autism link is not listed as an official side effect and has no medical support. these are listed as official side effects and risks, and has medical support. stop being ridiculous and deflecting.
"
13794,So you think MMR causes autism?
13795,Phew! 😅 
13796,"no i don't. autism is not  listed as an official side effect of MMR and has no medical support as being a risk or side effect whereas the vaccine, FDA, webmd, etc list all of these as being official side effects and risks of gardasil. you are truly being foolish if you can't tell the difference between side effects and conjecture. i don't understand how you can argue when i've linked/shared the official side effects. 
you are in denial and comparing the legitimate side effects of one vaccine to the imagined unofficial gossip of another is just ridiculous. "
13797,i told you i'm not being an anti vaxxer i'm just sharing what all of the risks and side effects are: regardless of how rare or infrequent they are. there's nothing wrong with being informed and sharing legitimate information.

If you can go for it and it is consensual, then go for it. Dont worry too much about it. Know the warning signs, dont go in gung ho, dont let your emotions take over and regret afterwards.

Heh, you'll be unique then, I've literally never seen a dental dam.

> Would you all recommend this behavior or will I regret it if I catch something?

Nah, not really. I'd recommend just finding a few good FWBs and have sex with them often. I've had sex with 20+ girls and at one time I put a lot of emphasis on the number of women I had been with with, but in the end the experiences I really cherished were with the ones that I was with for a long period of time and had sex with over and over again, and the one-night-stands were the worst."

I get laid 150x a year with my LTR so try to beat that for an added challange."

You won't ""catch something"" — but really, is this a goal worth pursuing?  How about the opposite: deeply meaningful and exhilarating sexual experiences with *one* partner?"
13806,I don’t get it. I guess I’m out of the loop? Help me out here.

As The Humungus said, ""I understand your pain. We've all lost someone we love.""  But  when you isolate yourself — either literally or by immersing yourself in loveless sex — you make that pain into the organizing principle of your life."

13829,"Can’t if you’re a male. If you have the warts you have low risk, if you don’t though there’s no way to tell if you have high risk. But that’s about it. You can’t find out exactly what # of strain you have. "
13830,"Gosh! Good question. Is a vasectomy out of the question? Sorry, but this is the first thing that came (excuse the pun) to mind.

Edit: a vasectomy obviously won't solve the STD problem (duh). Have you guys checked online to see if you can order condoms in sizes that might be more appropriate for his post-post orgasm size? There has to be something out there that would work."
13831,I stumbled across this post a few days late but after reading this several times I’ve come to the conclusion that I have no fucking idea what you’re talking about and that this might just be the most confusing post I’ve ever read. Seriously though reading this was like trying to read Chinese backwards without knowing Chinese to begin with. Am I the only one who struggled with this ? Ok going to take another shot at this after I get a good 8 hours of sleep and maybe it won’t be as hard for me to interpret. Fingers crossed 🤞 
13832,I don’t know if I understand your question. Why would it be a risk at all?
13833,"I'm sorry but there are just too many derogatory terms here.

""Leaky dick"", ""smallest penis I've ever seen"", and stigmatizing cum for starters.

We don't speak about women in deragatory terms here and you shouldn't be speaking this way about men.  There are ways to ask your question and answer responses without being so insulting."
13834,"Good thought! He has the smallest dick I’ve ever seen on a man once he’s soft. Definitely a “grower,” because it’s barely more 3D than a button otherwise."
13835,"Sorry!  Here's an attempt at a straightforward version:

&#x200B;

1.  We hope to have multiple partners
2. We don't want STIs.
3. We usually play for hours
4. While we're playing, he leaks a lot of precum and ejaculates every half hour or so.
5. After the first few ejaculations, he is MUCH too small to keep a condom on or penetrate me, but we still grind and use hands quite a bit, and cum kind of gets everywhere. 
6. Despite cum more or less everywhere, we'd still like to be smart/safe/responsible, and I'm soliciting methods to do that."
13836,"Because bodily fluids carry risk! Male cum is one of the higher risk fluids, so it would be nice to know what that risk is in the absence of penetration. Mostly I think we get in on our hands without thinking about it, then play with me. We hop up and wash our hands whenever I notice it, but that’s a small percentage of the time"

13840,"But honestly... I think anything that’s transmitted via cum dies really fast when it’s not in a warm moist environment. Like, some drips on your hand? It’s dead in a couple seconds. I’m not a doctor, but I think that’s true.

HPV and HSV are transmitted via skin to skin contact. Cum has nothing to do with it."
13841,"Heaven forbid anyone think I’m complaining. Talented, patient, and willing - oh my, indeed!"
13842,Good point! I’ll ask him about his screening practices with other partners
13843,"Yes, there is a vaccine called gardasil. Google it now and learn about it. Go to your doctor, or any health facility that can administer it to you and get it. This vaccine is for both men and women, it can prevent you from contracting HPV, I've read that it can also help stop the spread of HPV if you already have it. There are new articles out today about a new robust version for people up to 45. 

Sadly for men there isn't really a way to test for HPV, unless you are showing visible signs of an infection. i. e. warts. 

&#x200B;

There's no way to know if you contracted HPV through oral sex. HPV can lay dormant in a persons system for a long time. So even if you did get it from her, until you start showing symptoms you just won't know. This is why HPV is so common. "
13844,"In addition to the excellent advice from the other commenter, get Lysine to take as a supplement (a vitamin).  It helps block the replication of herpes viruses. Just take it a few times a week to help give you the best chance of not developing symptoms or catching a version of HPV you don't currently have. "
13845,"> sn't really a way to test for HPV, unless you are showing visible signs of an infection. i. e. wart

Whaaat? can't they just take a sample from my blood and tell if I have HPV? ohshit!
I heard that the Type 16 causes a lot of Head Throat and Penis cancer in men

Are you sure I can get vaccine against the Type 16 and It won't do me any harm? (since I may already be HPV(16) positive?"
13846,"There are no tests for men. [Read this](https://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/hpvandmen-fact-sheet-february-2012.pdf), from the CDC about HPV and men. The vaccine is recommended for everyone who is sexually active. Even if you have HPV you should get it, the important thing to know is that there are over 100 types of HPV, the vaccine can help prevent you from getting other types of the virus as well. Since there's no way of knowing if you got it from this girl, get the vaccine. Keep your immune system up. Make an appointment with a doctor immediately.

&#x200B;

Also talk to this girl you're with. Ask when she had symptoms, ask her if her latest pap smear came back clean. If it did you're probably in the clear, but get vaccinated anyway!"
13847,"Well, there ARE ways of testing men.  Researchers do it for studies all the time. 

HPV testing seems to be more available for gay men as apparently it can cause more health problems for them.

Anyway, HPV infection usually does NOT result in cancer for the great majority of people. "
13848,">o way to know if you contracted HPV through oral sex. HPV can lay dormant in a persons

that is the problem. Because, she does have HPV type 16. and **she did get a kind of cancer**.which she got removed back in 2013.  She doesn't know exactly how bad it was, because the Doctor didn't tell her her directly,........Maybe he told her mom. which seems not being honest enough with her. All that she knows is what she as able to quickly read on her medical files, when she found it unattended. She read that she had a **""non invasive cancer""**  The Doctor recommended that: She should not sunbath, except real early in the morning, or late afternoon. And he also told her, that she should never ever receive professionally done massage  (don't ask me why) . and he also told her not to bath or shower in hot water. she goes to the doctor, and does her pap smear annually. And so far, they didn't have to do any other surgery"
13849,"Yes lab researchers can test for it. There is no test you can get from any medical professional you can visit to test for HPV in men.

From the article you linked.

>Most cases of HPV infection are latent, transient, and detectable only with tests for viral DNA

&#x200B;

>Although 3 HPV DNA testing kits are commercially available for use in women (Hybrid Capture II \[Digene Corporation, Gaithersburg, Maryland\], Cervista HPV HR and Cervista HPV 16/18 \[Hologic Inc, Bedford, Massachusetts\]), none are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in men.

These two statements taken together means that researchers might be able to detect the virus in men, but that test is not approved for use in the general public to diagnose HPV. Meaning for a man who is afraid they might have HPV there are no tests or blood work you can get done to see if you have the virus.

13866,"You're right about HPV in males without symptoms, but I would still recommend talking with your doctor about this! There are many strains of HPV and the vaccine may still be beneficial. "
13867,"Private message I got from one doctor @ Reddit:

> I don’t know who you are or why you decided to post that, but it’s incredibly thorough and well done. I agree pretty much with everything. It seems that most folks clear, some have persistent nasty infections, and then some just keep having positive pcr but no obvious disease, or negative for years and then turn positive again for no reason, and it seems like there is some sort of latency or dormancy that may happen that we don’t fully understand. It’s also hard cause you just never know when people are lying or getting cheated on and don’t know it.

> In any case, I tend to agree with disclosure, but it’s hard because of how complicated it is. It’s a very unique std in that it had many permutations, everyone likely gets some degree of it, it’s often invisible, and there is no treatment. If you have persistent warts then disclosure seems like the right thing to do. But what about a lady with hpv on her paps? Should all women tell partners about that? Should just the ladies with high risk strains? What about ladies that have dysplasia but don’t get hpv pcr checked? And of course what about men? Hpv’d dicks are probably the biggest problem, but we don’t even make an effort to screen them.

> It’s interesting, I had a friend send me his gf’s Pap results and ask me what they meant. All they said was hpv defected, did not mention strain. I didn’t really know what to tell him. Do I say it’s a simple normal finding that should be followed until it’s clear, and that all women will get it from time to time? Do I tell him they need to investigate it, find exactly what strain it is? Do I tell him to avoid performing oral on her indefinitely, as to avoid risk of head and neck cancer for himself? I honestly didn’t know what to say, especially because nothin so say will likely help in any way, and will just make him worry. So really I just emphasized her continuing to get paps, cause that’s the only thing I know of that can be helpful.

13868,"Go get it bro,I never thought I was the kind of person that will get hpv then boom I got dick bumps (gw),so if u know what I know now u will schedule for an appointment right now..good luck "
13869,"Get the vaccine bud, worth every penny if it helps you prevent HPV and GW. "
13870,Get the shot- the cut off for that vaccine is 27 years old. 
13871,"I was ""fighting"" warts for a long time and the ""fight"" got a lot easier after I received the vaccine shots. It was not the only thing that changed about my lifestyle/circumstances/health around that time so I can't be hundred percent sure it was because of the vaccine. As for ""disclosing"" a non symptomatic infection, I personally always will. I want to know how people ""feel"" about HPV because if they are afraid of it, then it's a dealbreaker for ME. "
13872,"You're supposed to get vaccinated before being exposed in order for vaccines to work. The only thing that vaccines will do now is protect you from several strands you may not have, but if you already have warts (hpv), then you can't get rid of  that specific strand. I think you should always tell future partners, because one day they may wake up with warts and you will feel bad or of course they will blame it on you. "
13873,Thanks! so safe to assume that you didn’t have any outbreaks afterwards?
13874,I thought immune system clears out the hpv within 6months to 2+yrs? From what I read on other threads the vaccine will help prevent reoculatuon and reinfection. But doesn’t mention if reoccurrence  also. Unless reinfection and reoccurrence are the same thing?
13875,"No, the warts I still had when getting the shots were a lot easier to treat afterwards and didn't come back. I haven't had a single new one for more than three and a half years now."
13876,"when they say your immune system clears it out, they mean your body will be able to get a hold of it so you may not get as frequent break outs of hpv warts, or in cancer cells, you body might be able to suppress them, but it does not mean your body gets rid of the virus. Lets say one day you have a flu, your body might have a weakened immune system, so therefore warts might pop out since your immune system is down. The virus will always be there but after lets say 2 years, your own body should be able to control it, but you can still pass it to others even if your body has gotten a hold of it. "
13877,"I forgot to mention, the vaccine protects i believe only against 4-5 strands of hpv, a few that cause warts and cancer cells, but there are over 100 types of different types of hpv, so you can still get other strands that could cause warts or cancer cells. "

13879,"Man I have some stories for you! I'll try to keep it short. You and I have a lot in common. 

My nmom got my cancer stricken dad to trash my room at 15 so she could look for condoms I better be glad she didn't find. My daddy died a year later. 

Everything is life is my fault because I spend too much time with my boyfriend and his daughter. I'm 33! Several years ago I was cheated on by my narc ex and when she found out a few days later she screamed in my face that it was my fault for not listening to her and living with him and blah blah blah. She was so nasty that my brother had his arms around me like he was trying to shield me from her words. I didn't even get ""comfort"" from her till after I screamed at her that any other mother would be hugging her devastated daughter right now. Then she came to hug me but she started mocking my tears! I pushed her off me and tried to leave her house but she blocked the door and I knew if I reacted I was going to hurt her. I'm a foot taller and probably double her weight. So I stood there letting her humiliate me till I could leave. I was 27 when that happened. A month later on Valentine's Day she sent me pics of flowers she got from some guy. She didn't care I was at home crying over being betrayed by my fiance. Nope.

Secular music was a sin at all times in my house growing up. We still listened but it got annoying just to listen to the fucking radio. She also came into my room while I was doing homework one night and made me tear down a bunch of NSYNC and BSB posters off the wall and into the trash can because they were ""demonic"". She really just didn't like the fact that I found a white dude attractive. I paid for all those posters and it was a lot of money down the drain. My dad and brother were stunned but of course no one helped me. 

My nmom makes everything about her. She's ruined both of my SILs first pregnancies (I have no hope for mine to be peaceful unless I go no contact, I'm low contact right now). She made my brother's college graduation about her, all three of their collective weddings, anyone else's wedding, my depression, her grandsons tutoring, my last break up, ALL ABOUT HER. We were both at a wedding earlier this year. She was the MC at the reception.  The whole night she was fixated on a woman who she swore was out to get her after the lady's husband was ""flirting"" with her. Everyone is anyways flirting with her. Then she asked me to stand in between her and the lady so she couldn't she her! I said absolutely not, grabbed her a chair and told her to sit down and rest her injured leg (another story unrelated to narcissism) behind a table and I took off to dance. I wasn't getting involved in some silly shit. 

I'm to the point now where I'm ready to call her and her bullshit out and if she disowns me then whatever. I don't need this shit. "
13880,"Hey lady,

I had an incredibly similar experience a couple of years ago -- my ex boyfriend and I were together for 5 years, and were open during the last 9 months or so, all while I was going through HPV/abnormal cells. 

Basically, I had a level 2 abnormal pap, or a ""Sin 2"" they call it, and had to go in for a Leep procedure. Subsequently, I tested positive for HPV.  I had the same concerns upon diagnosis, unsure whether or not I should disclose this information to other partners, but like you, was told it was unnecessary by my doctors. Ultimately I think this is due to the fact that men cannot test for HPV, and most people have or have had HPV in their lifetime, which puts a ton of burden/stigma on you for no real reason. Especially as most strains ago away on their own and do not require treatment. 

But of course, there is a still a chance you will spread it to your other parters, or your parter will spread it to their partners... My advice would be to use protection 100% of the time you are having sex with other partners. However, in the context of your relationship, I wouldn't worry about it too much... My ex and I didn't use protection when we had sex with each other, and eventually my HPV went away and we never had any other problems. 

As for the leep procedure, definitely wait and see if your condition improves! If not, Leep is a great option. I was under anesthesia during the procedure so it was painless, and hardly had any cramping in the days to follow. A year and a half later I'm totally good to go! No abnormal cells, no HPV, just one healthy reproductive system :) 

I hope this helps feel free to message me if you are curious to know more about my experience. 

<3"

Most strains of HPV are harmless.

Some strains of HPV are correlated with cancer: cervical cancer, various head and neck cancers, penile cancer.  

It seems really, really worthwhile to find out.

I don't think Guardasil will help you if you're already infected, but you should check.  "
13882,"One more thing, my doctor recommended I start taking a multi vitamin and 1000 mg of vitamin C daily to boost my immune system. I also worked hard in other ways to boost my immunity, like making sure I'm getting enough sleep, drinking less, and exercising more regularly. All which I think really helped me to fight off the HPV and get rid of it once and for all (hopefullly!!)"
13883,"Thanks so much for sharing your experience! Noted on the vitamins and etc - that's probably a good idea anyway and I'm getting started with a general wellness improvement thing myself.

Did your doc mention getting the newer Gardasil vaccine since you weren't monogamous? Did you get the earlier version? The 9-strain version came out in 2014."
13884,"Psychological/somatization is a definite possibility. Whatever it is doesn’t seem dangerous, so there is little harm in treating it with therapy. I highly doubt another doctor will be very useful at this point.

Also assuming you have normal kidney function, that dose of gabapentin won’t be very effective. You need to be on 600mg three times per day at least in order to achieve  receptor occupancy high and long enough for an effect."
13885,I recover the shots years ago whenever they first came out- not even 5 months later I was at the doctors complaining of numbness in my spine and down into my feet. Eventually leading into drop foot. The doctors were baffled and never truly came up with why this happened but had suggested the shots are what caused it. It took 6 months of physical therapy and many MANY doctors. Eventually I was just able to walk again and didn’t really think about it until I went to the chiropractor once. He told me one of his patients was paralyzed from getting the shot. 
13886,"I understand that there is a psycho/somatic aspect to pain and numbness, wish I had the knowledge to know how applicable that is to my case. Hard pill to swallow but I appreciate you being candid about that. I will ask my doctor about increasing the Gabapentin dosage, thanks for that insight!"
13887,"The vaccine protects you from multiple strains of HPV, so even if you already have one form of it, you'll still benefit from the vaccine. The vaccine is safe, so the horror stories tend to be greatly exaggerated. Unless you have a medical reason to avoid the vaccine, it will likely be in your best interest to continue with the rest of the vaccine regimen."
13888,"Definitely still worth it, there are multiple dangerous strains, so you should at least get protection against those. Do you by any chance know which strain you have. 

You can do genotyping for HPV to find out."
13889,"Probably still worth it, but you should talk to your doctor "
13890,"It is likely the nurse improperly administered this vaccine (that is, he or she may have given the shot at a spot it wasn’t supposed to go in). Go to your doctor for help. While this is not normal, it is the most common adverse event associated with vaccines."
13891,Poor technique. Part of the risk when going through a pharmacy for this. It'll take a while but it should get better. Ice it frequently. 
13892,"Hi! As someone who has had both the meningitis and HPV I gotta say the HPV hurts so so bad- much more than any vaccine Iv had . My pain didn’t last more than 3 days but it was to the point where I couldn’t raise my arm past a certain point. I wouldn’t worry too much of it being something serious, but you may as well see the doctor for peace of mind ☺️☺️"
13893,It could've been improperly administered or she could have hit a nerve. Give it some time to sort out.
13894,"When administering vaccines, most organizations require accurate documentation regarding which arm the vaccine went into, the lot number, expiration date, etc. Call and ask to see if they can give you this information, even if they will just tell you which vaccine was placed in the right arm. Best wishes. "
13895,"They aren’t nurses. The pharmacist gives the vaccines, just to clarify. "
13896,The third dose of the HPV shot hurts the most for some reason. 
13897,"Huh. Makes sense, but I didn’t know they could do that."
13898,I would consider that current treatments for autoimmune diseases can weaken the immune system. Receiving the HPV vaccine could prevent him from a) getting HPV and b) having a longer lasting and more difficult to treat case of warts if he is on something that weakens his immune system. Have a good long sit down with your doctor and weigh the pros and cons. 
13899,"I got the vaccine for it when I was a kid, and guess what? Still got HPV, and my Pap smears come back abnormal ALL. THE. TIME. I have had 3 colposcopies, and 1 LEEP procedure. I started going to the gynecologist at 22, and all of this was done before I turned 24. I honestly think that it does not matter if he gets it or not, if he becomes sexually active, he's like 90% likely to get it. "
13900,"Josh Mazer is pro-vaccine, but wants vaccines to be based on sound scientific evidence and not to cause more harm than good, he also believes in providing informed consent on the risks/dangers of each vaccine.

His journey began after a school nurse approached him and explained how she was being ""forced"" against her own sound judgement to market the HPV vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old school children, Josh decided to find out more. 

The nurse showed him letters from Maryland Department of Health outlining the new policy. He first contacted Dr. Jinlene Chan, who had signed the letters, she could not provide evidence to back up the need for the vaccine. He then contacted Dr. Ken Lin Tai, director of the Cancer Control and Prevention unit at the Department of Health, but she couldn't provide any evidence either. Finally he met with Dr. Howard Haft, deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health who said it was CDC, yet CDC’s policy is to not take positions on state-specific legislation.

Suspecting that there was something else going on behind the scenes, in April 2018 he filed a Public Information Act request with the Prevention and Health Promotion Administration only to discover that the Maryland health department had received $91.6 million pharma funded non-profits to promote the HPV vaccine in Maryland. 

Keep in mind that Big Pharma can skip taxes by saying they are donating to non profits / 'charities' which they control, as we see they are then using this 'washed' the money (which should have been paid in taxes) to lobby/bribe government officials, who in return reward them by setting up unscientific pushes for dangerous Big Pharma products. These non profits / 'charities' are also used to misinform the media about whatever the latest 'health crisis' is and why the latest dangerous Big Pharma products are 'essential' to save the day.

Josh wanted to find out more about the supposed HPV 'health crisis', so he met with Dr. Pete Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland. Dr Doshi said he was unaware of any HPV 'health crisis' and explained that 98 percent of HPVs clear the body naturally within a few years. It was also confirmed that Maryland’s rates of cervical cancer were in decline for years prior to introduction of the vaccine; the vaccine itself has never been proven to prevent cancer. It was noted that HPVs are sexually transmitted, an important fact not disclosed in the health department letter.

Josh warns ""The approach being used by our state to prevent HPV cancer seems to be centered on fear mongering the dangers of the disease and over selling the potential benefits of the vaccine. The entire effort seems to be more a sales campaign than a disease prevention program."" He then points out that the vaccine itself has been proven to have the capacity to kill healthy individuals ""The harm that may arise is tragically illustrated by the death in 2008 of Sparks resident Christina Tarsell after her third HPV shot. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision September of 2017 states the preponderance of evidence demonstrates the shot series caused the fatal arrhythmia that took Christina’s life.""

So in short:- 

 1. Big Pharma skip their taxes donating to lobbyists disguised as charities, thereby washing the money

 2. The lobbyists bribe government health officials

 3. In return unscientific and dangerous products gets mandated by government

 4. People are made sick from the mandated products, meaning they buy more Big Pharma drugs to treat their symptoms

 5. Rinse and repeat

13901,"Perfectly normal.

There are over 100 types of HPV.

The vaccine only innoculates for 2 or 3 most common and dangerous (cancer causing) types. "
13902, I can still get cervical cancer though.
13903,Yes but you're a reduced risk. 
13904,Yes. Still get the vaccine.  There are 100 different strains of HPV. 
13905,"Get the vaccine as there are many types of the virus, as the guy above stated. HPV is more harmful for women, so your girlfriend, and every sexualy active woman, should be tested regularly by her gynecologist. Don't worry HPV is quite common among young adults. "
13906,"If you want to use Inosine Pranobex then you could print leaflet (""Imunovir PDF"" in Google) and talk about it with your doctor. However you already take Interferon shots so I think that it should be enough (but I'm not a doctor).

Many redditors from USA wrote that you can get Gardasil shots. Just don't mention your age.

Gardasil won't clear actual infection but can be useful against other HPV strains + reinfection + self-inoculation. In patients with RPP it improves immune response."
13907,Any word on your treatment resolution or progress? 
13908,[deleted]
13909,I don't live in USA
13910,"It isn't *necessary*. But it is a very good idea whether you intend to have sex before marriage or not. Your risk of infection with HPV without sexual activity is essentially nil, so you could put off the vaccination, but it's also easy to put off vaccines indefinitely until it's too late."
13911,"Yeah, as a pediatrician, I still recommend it for my young men because it protects not only you, but potentially your future partners. We can carry HPV asympotmatically from prior sexual encounters and spread it to a future partner (particularly the ones which can cause cervical and vaginal cancers). Given that a single vaccine can prevent this, it is in my view a good thing.

Edit: as an adult, you are able to consent for your own treatment, in general. "
13912,Yes.
13913,You should. It makes a difference.  I have HPV and didn't get the vaccine.  My gf got the vaxine and she doesn't have it. 
13914,"HPC is generally recommended for sexually active females, as it causes cervical cancer. You as a male can't really get cervical cancer, but you will act as a vector, spreading the virus every time you have unprotected sex. Where I live, the vaccination is free for females but expensive for males, so no guy ever gets it, though there are a lot of discussions about also vaccinating boys. 

It is also true that it makes the most sense to vaccinate before you have sex for the first time, but you can get the vaccine at any point in your life and it will work just fine. Depending on how much it is I would get it."
13915,"As a male you can't get cervical cancer or vaginal cancer (obviously). You're still at risk of genital warts, anal cancer, and oral cancer, and the vaccine protects against all of those."
13916,"At least in the US, HPV vaccine is recommended for everyone, not just female patients."
13917,As others have said HPV vaccines is recommended not only for young women but also young men. It directly decreases their risk of developing cancers of the throat - in addition to the benefits of preventing them from being a vector for HPV transmission.
13918,"I actually just found out the institution that makes reccomendations for vaccines (STIKO in Germany) approved of vaccinating boys between 9 and 14 as well three weeks ago. Guess we, or at least I, was far behind the curve there."

13921,"I got mine done at Planned Parenthood in my 30s and they gave me zero crap about it.  I'd still get it done: there are many strains of HPV; indeed, the ones that cause warts are not the scary ones, and the vaccine protects against several of the scary ones. 

I'd also look for a new doctor, personally."
13922,"I paid cash for my vaccine series.  I was 28, and my father died from probable HPV-related oral cancer.  So “you’re too old” wasn’t an excuse to take no for an answer.  

It protects against strains of HPV that can hurt you. Even if you test positive for one strain, you can get protected against other strains with the vaccine.  Typical tests that they do at the docs office will simply show positive or negative, not tel which strain you were positive for.  

Pay for it and get it.  I’m an RN, researched it and used my medical brain to decide it was totes worth it. "
13923,"The HPV vaccine protects young women against strains of HPV that cause cervical cancer.   


If you read the UK guidance on the vaccine: [https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-human-papillomavirus-vaccine/#hpv-vaccination-for-men-and-boys](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vaccinations/hpv-human-papillomavirus-vaccine/#hpv-vaccination-for-men-and-boys)  


Especially this: [https://www.bupa.co.uk/health-information/directory/g/genital-warts](https://www.bupa.co.uk/health-information/directory/g/genital-warts)  


\> At the moment, in the UK the HPV vaccine against types 6, 11, 16 and 18 is offered to girls aged 12 to 13. There’s also a ‘catch-up’ campaign for girls 14 to 18.

\> As HPV is so common, most sexually active women will already have been infected. That’s why the vaccine is limited to girls at the moment – in the UK, women older than 18 aren’t routinely vaccinated. If you’re already infected with an HPV type that the vaccine can protect against, you won’t benefit fully from the vaccine – it isn’t as useful.

\> The vaccine isn't offered to boys or men because the main purpose of this vaccination is to prevent cervical cancer. Provided girls are vaccinated before they start having sex, it isn’t necessary to vaccinate men for this to help. But research is continuing, so we’ll learn more about the effects of the vaccine in time, and if it will be offered to others."
13924,"Honestly, my old guy retired and this one replaced him and took his patients. He didn't instill confidence in me when I went to him for the warts either. I'll see where the closest Planned Parenthood is from me.

Edit: do you remember what it cost you by chance? I read around $300?

Thanks. "

13930,"I am so sorry you had to go through this! So, so sorry! Have you found a good therapist to talk through it? It's definitely covert sexual abuse and I've read it's behaviour that is caused by the n having their own boundaries violated as a child... That is absolutely no excuse to be treating you the way she is, though! Unfortunately, she will probably not stop and I think it would be a good idea to consider options of limiting contact. Best of luck! "
13931,"Thanks, just read up on that. I don’t THINK that’s what she’s doing.... it feels more like she sees me as sexual competition. She did other weird stuff to me aswell, like she had lovely long blonde hair, but she insisted on me having a literal bowl cut. She wore nice clothes and I had to wear boys clothes. I was mocked and humiliated if I ever tried to wear makeup and do anything girly. Sabotaging me as if she’s in competition with me."

13933,"I'd like to add that my ndad also had and still has boundary issues with nudity and sexuality. He made and still makes sexualized remarks about my body. He always walks around naked at home or barely covers up with a bathrobe that would open at the most inopportune places. When I was a teen my stepmom would also run around naked and aggresively pressured me to sunbathe in the nude on holiday. I caught them having sex on more than one occasion. After they broke up my dad proceeded to have loud sex with multiple women with me in the house. Once I had to explain the noise to the woman's daughter, who was 8. My dad was physically abused during childhood and it can definitely be said that my grandfather had no regard for his corporeal health whatsoever, but I dont know if there was any sexual abuse. My stepmom was treated like cinderella (before the magic) by her mother and raped by a stranger when she was 14. Whatever it was something happened so they never learned about healthy barriers and proceeded to violate mine. "

13936,"You can still get the 3rd dose now, and could take it even later. 

Some countries have opted to offer the vaccine in an extended plan, where shot 2 is taken 6 months later and there is no 3rd dose. Canada and sweden have done this. 3 doses were the original plan, and there are many studies complete and on going studying  efficacy in less doses. So, theoretically, 2 doses are enough.

If I were you, and I could afford the vaccine without going hungry, I would take the 3rd dose. Whatever the price, this is your health and that of everyone you have sex with. This last dose serves as a booster, reinforcing to your defense cells what HPV looks like so to speak."

13938,"You should maybe have a visit with your doc because these could be symptoms of something bigger. It could just be weed, it could just be your anxiety, it could be that caffeine. It can be a combination of all of them. The only way we can figure it out without a doctor would be the process of elimination. Maybe stop doing weed for a bit and see if it gets better. Then stop drinking coffee and see if that improves how you feel. To be honest if I had to hazard a guess, it sounds like the caffeine might be messing you up. Those symptoms make me think of high blood pressure and the fact that you already have anxiety is a recipe for disaster with caffeine. I used to be addicted with caffeine when I was 15 and I had a full on panic attack on a day when I didn't even have any. I realized that caffeine stays in your system well after you drank it. It also made me have heart palpitations. Some of us are just more sensitive to caffeine and shouldn't be taking it, esp if you have anxiety problems.

So, I'd start with eliminating the caffeine. Teeter off of it and start replacing coffee with tea. Tea still has caffeine but there's less. Take a very cold shower to wake yourself up instead.

Good luck :)"

Cautery can stop the spread of HPV and CIN1 mutations, speeding up regression. Looked into it after my gyno told me that ""the CIN1 is worse, but the cautery might have fixed it, see me in 6 months"". Apparently it can help some cases. So if you are having bleeding and showing signs of erosion (gynos call it something different now, but they'll know what you mean), and also have CIN1, DEFINITELY agree to the elective cautery. Not only will it reduce or remove the erosion, it could help with the CIN1."

13947,"> Cigarette smoking is associated with numerous diseases and poses a serious challenge to the current healthcare system worldwide. Smoking impacts both innate and adaptive immunity and plays dual roles in regulating immunity by either exacerbation of pathogenic immune responses or attenuation of defensive immunity. Adaptive immune cells affected by smoking mainly include T helper cells (Th1/Th2/Th17), CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells and memory T/B lymphocytes while innate immune cells impacted by smoking are mostly DCs, macrophages and NK cells.

> Our findings are consistent with and extend the findings of other investigators that smoking increases the risk for EGWs caused by non-oncogenic HPV infection, and our data suggest but cannot confirm that these factors may similarly affect lesions attributable to oncogenic genital HPV infections. Additionally, HIV and the consequent decline of immunity enhance this risk further as do historical EGWs. Most important, these relations persisted even after we controlled for the effect of the number of insertive and receptive sexual partners each man reported, age, education, study site, and time on study. We should continue to counsel patients to stop smoking.

If you are smoking, then you will clear HPV infection longer, no matter if it's low-risk HPV or high-risk HPV. If you need more sources, you can search for ""HPV smoking"" in Google or Google Scholar."
13957,"Genital warts are caused by low-risk HPV strains and they are called ""low-risk"" because they don't cause cancer. So you can calm down.

It's truly a public health issue, not just your own.

You could easily transmit HPV from one partner to another without ever knowing.

Some HPV strains can, indeed, cause cancers of the cervix, vulva, penis, or throat. Throat cancer is serious business.

No vaccine is perfect, and your still need to practice the safest sex you can. But by getting immunized, you are helping to protect yourself, your partners, and their future partners.

Getting vaccinated before you become sexually active will substantially reduce your risks down the road.

That's why we start offering it to younger children, rather than waiting until they are older and/or sexually active."

Hirsuties coronae glandis (also known as hirsutoid papillomas and pearly penile papules) (PPP) are small protuberances that may form on the ridge of the glans of the human penis. They are a normal anatomical variation in humans and are sometimes described as vestigial remnants of penile spines, sensitive features found in the same location in other primates. In species in which penile spines are expressed, as well as in humans who have them, the spines are thought to contribute to sexual pleasure and quicker orgasms.

13984,"I have some responses to different parts of this.

First, I think your ""women don't care about men's problems"" is a misinterpretation of ""people don't care about men's problems (as much as women's problems)"". Our society takes a protective attitude towards women, being generally more concerned about women's safety and well-being (mentally/emotionally and physically). It's *strongly* been my experience that this is something that both genders have their own role in. So (for the most part) any sort of ""you don't care about me!"" contempt that you can have towards women could also be targeted towards other men. Which you might agree with and argue for—but then you shouldn't care about other men's ""problems in the SMP"" (unless they're related to you) and you shouldn't care whether *women* care about other men's ""problems in the SMP"". After all, fuck 'em, you're only in it for yourself.

(Also, although I'm a pretty big believer in our tendency to care more about the well-being of women than men, I don't think it's as extreme as you're portraying.)

Second, it's not clear exactly what ""problems in the SMP"" you're talking about and what exactly you'd want from women in an ideal world. The problem is men who have a hard time finding sex and/or a relationship? Ok. What kind of response from women would satisfy you? Lowering their standards? Having pity sex? Getting into a ""pity relationship""? I don't think that's reasonable to expect, and I don't think most men would really want that anyway. Do you want to wife (or girlfriend) a woman who's had pity sex with 10 kissless virgins? A more reasonable request would be that women give better dating advice, although I don't think most of the bad dating advice is intentionally bad. Most of them really do think they're helping out their guy friends.

Third, I don't really see the parallel you're drawing with men's ""problems in the SMP"" and women's issues here. I'll assume the most reasonable answer to ""what kind of response from women would satisfy you"" that I can think of: women giving better dating advice. Assuming that, we're saying that because women give bad dating advice, you should not care about women being threatened, victimized, brutalized, raped, or abused? That seems extremely disproportionate!

Other points that you say not to care about, like ""women's inability to get a relationship from a sufficiently attractive man"", have a pretty clear parallel with men's inability to get a relationship from a sufficiently attractive woman. That's what you should focus on.

Fourth, your statements about women being (inherently?) unable to empathize with men as men aren't convincing. I get that our society tends to focus on women's safety and well-being (biology probably plays a role in that as well). But clearly it's possible. There are many women who clearly care very much about men as men: Christina Hoff Sommers (""based mom""), Karen Straughan (girlwriteswhat), Helen Smith (author of *Men on Strike*), etc.

And fifth, I think you've largely lost sight of women as individuals. I know I know, ""women are individuals"", what a BP cliché. But I think it really applies here. This post makes it seem like you see women as one person with one particular trait (not caring about men) and thus you're going to treat every woman as if they do that, unless they're related to you. On the topic of caring about ""women's inability to get a relationship from a sufficiently attractive man""—can't you take that on a case-by-case basis, at least to the extent that you know the person? If you know her then you probably have a sense of how much she'd care about you. Respond similarly.

13985,">--women's health services and health issues: Breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, HPV vaccines, public funding through Obamacare for birth control, abortion services

You say so much in this one little bullet point.

Why should men care about HPV vaccines if they don't care about women? Because HPV causes cancer in men almost as frequently as it causes cancer in women.

Obamacare/the ACA, did not provide funding for birth control. It provid**ed** insurance coverage of birth control for women who had insurance. Just like it provides coverage for vaccines for people who have insurance. 

Since that mandated coverage has been discontinued, it is now legal for an insurance company or an employer to refuse to include birth control in insurance coverage due to religious reasons.

Imagine if you wanted to get Viagra and your employer said ""I don't believe in that so our insurance policy doesn't cover it"". Your employer shouldn't have any say about what prescriptions your doctor writes but they now have a say. It's just like having your pay docked when your employer finds out you're using your pay to buy beer.

If you're okay with that, then you're right. You shouldn't care about whether or not an employer has the right to fuck with your health care.

Likewise, Obamacare didn't offer any funding for abortion services. It had nothing to do with abortion services. It is legal to have an abortion in the United States. The government does not provide funding for it. Your insurance may or may not cover it."
13986,"It's hard to be happy when the men you care about aren't happy. So you are right in that most women aren't going to care about some strange man's sex life (nor some strange woman's love life for that matter), but they will care about whether or not the men close to them are happy. So my solution is for guys to befriend women and get close to them, if they want these women to care.   

For your second point, I agree that men have no obligation to care about women's problems. Most of the women problems you listed I don't even care about. And even if they are legitimate problems, I'd prefer for women to handle them on their own without the help of men.  "

13988,"The equivalent to women for caring about men's dating problems is men not caring about women's dating problems. Which I think is perfectly reasonable. People's personal problems are their business.

Standing by as you watch a woman get beaten or raped, as you seem to be suggesting men do, is not equivalent to that. Anyone who would allow bodily harm to come to someone when they could easily stop it, just because of a personal vendetta against ""women"" as a group is not a good person, nor would be a woman who acted that way towards men."
13989,"I care about those issues because they're a result of shitty and sometimes illegal behavior; there's an aggressor who needs to be dealt with, or a systemic problem to solve.

Male problems in the SMP are a personal problem with no aggressor and no direct solution (EDIT: other than personal growth). If a man I knew was having trouble getting laid, I wouldn't know because I don't pry in that manner and I'm not interested in my friend's sexual histories. 

Plus, the majority of the problems you mentioned have far higher stakes. Domestic abuse is an order of magnitude more dangerous than a dry spell or inceldom. 

If your sympathies lie more with the latter, then I'm not sure how anyone could change your view; your priorities may just be skewed.

There are problems that men face that are more analogous to the female problems you mentioned; problems that demand far more attention. Problems like childhood abuse, the treatment of male rape victims, gang violence, bullying, family court, the avoidance of medical treatment and therapy, elevated suicide rates, workplace conditions, rates of imprisonment, etc. I care about those just as much as women's rights because they're worth caring about.

EDIT: Also, choosing to be a motherfucker _probably_ isn't going to help, and I doubt men in general will jump onboard with this line of thinking."

It's just hard to take them seriously when they bitch and complain about relatively minor shit, and then proceed to demonize men as a group, whilst ignoring any problems/issues men face as a whole (issues that imo are fucking BAD, at least according to every metric that governs quality of life and such).  

So yeah, it's really hard for me to be overly sympathetic to the issues of women on average.  Now, if a woman has a singular issue that is fairly severe, i can empathize and even console her, but as a group?  Fuck no.  I dont see how theyre not one of the most privileged classes in the entiriety of the world and human history ,and I know damn well most of them  could give a shit about teh problems men face"

Grandma: ""But Grandson, it would have been inappropriate for me to get involved in your love life, your SMV ect.""

Grandson: ""Still you should have no matter how inappropriate.  Because you didn't, now your broken hip is no longer my issue""....mwa ha ha ha ha.""

14008,"No one expects men to proactively ""care"" about women's problems. In every women's movement, almost all of the early agitators have been women. Men who join early do so because they are personally affected (their girlfriend is into it, or their mother was abused) and men who join later do so at a point when it is beneficial for them to be seen publicly ""caring""- because women have already changed the culture around the issue.

If mras can accomplish what feminists already have - i.e. A cultural shift due to education - they'll get female support. No one will, or ever has, stuck their neck out for something without expecting something in return.

As for the traditional male way of ""caring"":

> o not help women you're not related to, not having sex with, or not trying to have sex with. Do not lift heavy objects for them at work. Don't help subordinate women with tasks at work. Ignore and avoid any requests for assistance at all times from any woman you're not related to or having sex with. Don't stop to help a women with a disabled vehicle, flat tire, etc. Don't intervene when you see a man ""abusing"" a woman. Don't intervene if you see ""sexual harassment"", except to protect yourself or your employer.

This is already the norm in most, though not all, places I've lived. ""Chivalry"" is gone, except when the recipient is particularly young and pretty. 

Finally, there hasn't been even a pretense of male caring about women's smp/rmp problems, which I take it are most equivalent to the men's problems that truly bother you. Where have you seen any men advocating to marry those poor old divorcees and spinsters? Telling other men that they really shouldn't string women along? The landscape has always been that the sexes don't care about each other's sexual problems, because if they did, the solutions would be unpleasant things like single fifty year old men confining themselves to only pursuing fifty year old women. So nothing changes there.

Besides, what genuine smp problems do men have above and beyond those of women? You drive them yourselves with an overwhelming thirst for 18-30 year old women, such that the demand can never be met because there simply aren't enough young women. This means that women over 30 become way less in demand and are the thirsty ones for the many remaining decades they live. Stop obsessing over young hot women, go after the ones who are actually there, and your problem is solved.

If SMP was the only male problem women don't care about, your view would deserve being challenged. But no.

I've seen it way too many times; ask a woman to name five men's specific issues or needs, and observe the hamster magically trying to make the discussion about her. About gun control, because she is afraid of men with guns. About men and crying, because she wants to see men in tears more often, she finds it weirdly amusing.

14020,"And I appreciate your taking a good faith effort to address this. 

Before I get into responding:  I take it you don't think this is a workable ""solution"".   What is, then?  How should men address/deal with/respond to the fact that women don't care about men's problems in the SMP/RMP?   Or is there even a solution at all?

First:   Yes, everyone cares more about women's problems than men's problems.   I'm suggesting maybe we shouldn't be more strongly protective of women.   Perhaps like darkmoon said, that's something that cannot be done because men are hardwired to protect women and because thirst. 

Second:  I don't really expect anything from women in terms of ""caring"" that men can't get laid, have problems in the SMP, whatever.  Women pointed out in the other threads, quite rightly, that there's really nothing they can do, that they should do, and there's no reason they should care about it.    My suggestion is reciprocal:   There's nothing I can do about women's problems.  There's nothing I should do about them, and no reason I should care about them. 

Third:   I don't expect women to give better dating advice.   I really think women should not give men dating advice.   As for women getting brutalized, raped or abused - again, there's nothing I can do about that, nothing I should do, and no reason I should care, unless they're related to me.    What can I do?  I am already taxed to death to take care of women who cannot or will not take care of themselves.   

Fourth:   Some women care about men *qua* men.  There are exceptions to every rule.  

Fifth:   Yes, women are individuals.  That's why I drew the distinction between women a man is related to or sexually involved with, and all other women.   

> On the topic of caring about ""women's inability to get a relationship from a sufficiently attractive man""—can't you take that on a case-by-case basis, at least to the extent that you know the person?

14061,"> Women can either have the protected roles or have equal rights.
> If you try to have your cake and eat it too, you will destroy society (as is happening).
> But of course, you women would never learn that equal rights must mean equal responsibility. You choose to get wrapped up in ""muh gender roles"" but you won't ever accept your TRUE gender role.

What are you talking about, /u/BokehClasses? I'm a man, and a consistent critic of the fact that we have such a protective attitude towards women. I don't know where you got the impression that I'm a woman wrapped up in ""muh gender roles"" who wants women to be protected, unless you're specifically hoping to encounter such a person and you ended up projecting your hopes onto me."
14062,"Sorry for the delayed reply! My solution should be clear from my first two responses below.

First: I agree that we shouldn't give women such a big bonus (or even any bonus) in terms of caring about their safety/well-being. And I do believe it's possible to make progress in that. But this doesn't mean completely disregarding their safety and not caring even if they're abused, raped, or brutalized. Unless you also don't care at all for men, but I don't think that's the case.

Second: Women's dating/relationship troubles are in an entirely different category than actual *injustices* (like violence). If you're just applying your point to women's dating/relationship troubles (e.g. ""if people don't care about men's relationship troubles then why would I care about women's"") then I have substantially fewer problems.

Third: I mean, these are injustices happening to other human beings. But I think the main question here is whether you'd treat men the same and not care if they get abused/brutalized/raped. If yes, and you're just proposing to treat women the same way, then I disagree with the overall approach but I don't have any critiques related to inconsistency. But again I don't think that's the case.

Fourth: Those women that I mentioned (who advocate for men's issues) are a relatively small proportion of women, but their male equivalents (though there are somewhat more of them) are still a relatively small proportion of men too.

> Fifth: Yes, women are individuals. That's why I drew the distinction between women a man is related to or sexually involved with, and all other women.

My philosophy is to treat people as individuals to the extent that you can, so I'd base it on how much you know about the person rather than limiting it to family and sex partners."
14063,"Yeah but how is this different from arguing about not caring about feminism and women's issues in general? I have no problems with that but comparing not caring about crime to relationship issues might be a stretch. 

What I mean is, the SMP is different from being a victim of crime or harassment. I agree that men shouldn't care about certain things they care too much about, such as having one sided relationships that are all about her.

The closest thing, comparatively speaking, that men shouldn't care about that women want men to care about are their careers. If she doesn't get promoted, feels the environment is too hostile or is getting paid less because she isn't aggressive enough in wage negotiations, then don't care. She can't handle working and being independent? Don't care about it. She got pregnant and demands money from someone who didn't choose to be a parent? Don't care. Single mothers chose that shit, so too bad, so sad. Men also shouldn't care if women want to ""marry up"" but can't or about the 80/20 BS. If the average man isn't good enough for you, lady, then tough.

The stuff about rape and violence, though? I think minimizing that, as well as rape and violence against boys and men, is still important. But making men the sole scapegoats of violence women face? Don't care when they call it a gendered issue, because it isn't."
14064,You're wrong. Women don't hold our friends to the standards we hold our dates to. It's a completely separate grouping of standards -- it's totally possible to be good friends with someone who can't get a date.
14065,Preselection can work in your favor here. Get one women on your side and she'll talk you up to her friends.

14067,"You don't need to punch anyone in the face, if you see someone getting attacked you call the police or run and get help like a goddamn human being. This goes for either gender."
14068,I would say that calling the police is a perfectly reasonable bystander  response. Pointing and laughing because a woman is getting her just desserts for being a woman is not.

14070,"Not always. Sometimes they get into a relationship, it turns abusive, and they are stuck. They could be stuck due to having kids in the situation or pets who they feel protective over. Sometimes, lack of finances makes escape very difficult, as living on the street isn't safe for anyone.

More than that, the most dangerous time for someone in an abusive relationship is when they leave. http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/domestic-violence-victims-1.3885381 - to read more on that.

14078,"By all means you're free to respond to it as you please and if that's putting women on ice then fine, but personally imo this is largely a waste of time and it won't change anything as far as the power imbalance in the sexual game, women would probably just further retreat into their own corner as a response to a male backlash - *""see? Told you men are shit, how can they treat ladies this way?""*

You're right about one thing for sure, society doesn't and will likely continue to not care about men's problems because men are essentially roaches, we've always been the disposable sex and if some men are incapable of getting laid then wither away and die without reproducing. That's been the natural order of things among most mammalian species, humans are no different.

I know it sucks dude, but really, what *is* a solution? Because i just don't see one. How do you address the fact that a lot of men are left out in the cold without infringing on women's right to choose their sexual partners? You can't really, which is why people hold the *""tough shit* response to struggling males. There simply isn't a solution so these men are unfortunately just going to have to learn to deal with the fact that sex/relationships isn't in the cards for them (at least at the current moment) and find other things in life to fulfill themselves. I know, living life devoid of sex and intimacy is a rather hollow and depressing life to live and sadly some men would rather check out than have to live a life of chronic loneliness, frustration, and depression. It's a rather dismissive and shitty reponse to tell struggling men to just jack off in a corner and get over it. Sex and intimacy is such a fundamental pillar to the human experience that it's indeed a tragedy if one doesn't get to experience it, but again, i just don't see any formidable solution to this, especially when society is hell bent in ensuring that this conversation doesn't get air time.

As males, we're on our own. No one is coming to help you or comfort you. You have to make something out if yourself in this life."

14083,"Men are made to listen to women.  They're required to do so. They're shamed into it.  They're bullied into it.   They're moralized into it.   The feminine imperative demands that men subordinate their interests to any woman around them.   

I'm saying they need to stop doing that. "
14084,"Perhaps.  But I don't see any other effective way to address it. 

Women are absolutely right that they do not have to, and will not, have sex with men they're not attracted to.  Women are absolutely right that there's nothing they can do, nor want to do, to improve the plight of men in the SMP/RMP.    That's all very well and good.   

If women don't care about men, I see no reason men should care about women.  

Another thing:   It takes a concerted effort on men's part to not care about women.   Men are hardwired to protect any woman in his vicinity who appears to be in distress or need help.   Women are extraordinarily good at exploiting this male tendency."

Keep in mind, that this things must be done cautiously and rationally, since while you may not think clearly if someone is abusing your sister, or mother or father or brother, it is your family after all. You must think rationally when it is done to a stranger.

That's why I am very cautious on such cases since the blame can easily be shifted on you, thanks to our statist pseudo-democratic system where one group has all the power."
14089,"I mean you could say ""Who cares about women you don't want to fuck?  Don't help them at all!

You could also say ""women are wonderful creatures and you should sacrifice everything you've worked for an give it to them"".

Both sound a bit extreme, because there are certainly rational examples of helping women you don't want to fuck.  I'd help a female friend change a tire on her car because I'd also help a male friend change a tire on his car.  I wouldn't, however, change a tire on a womans car because she's weak and wonderful and then turn around and tell a guy he's got to suck it up and be a man.  I'd also not help a woman (or a man) change the brakes on their car or buy them groceries or be their taxi service because these are things that should be budgeted for and managed as a matter of daily life.

So I  think a rational middle ground is 'don't help women just because they're women.  If they deserve help because they're people, help them.  If they don't deserve help because its an issue they should have worked out on their own, let them learn from their failure"".

That sounds to me like ""don't be an orbiter""."

14095,"> I don't know what you mean here. Could you explain?

From what I derived from the OP, reciprocating male in group preference when women assume in group preference, is a fair and logical stance. With that stance, women would lose because they are the weaker sex and require men for many societal chores. On the other hand, men would benefit more since they would drop the parasitism of reproduction that women demand. The natural balance is then formed between men and women.

Women must trade in order to provide the prior free things they were receiving. Fix my car, fix the light, fix the air conditioner, drive me here and there, etc. But you aren't *entitled* to any sex.

> He responded to women not caring about men's relationship troubles with men not caring about women's relationship troubles and men not caring about women being brutalized, raped, and abused (his words, not mine).

But in a voluntary society, an agent can decide what decisions he or she would make in accordance with the law. A man can make a lawful decision to not provide protection or assistance to women in need just because they have a vagina. This is analogous to how women make a lawful decision to not provide sex or companionship to men in need just because they have a penis.

One has to acknowledge the inherit privileges of men and women to understand how they can trade in a natural environment. Women are weak in the facets of life, but are sought after for their eggs. Men are strong in the facets of life, but are chained to irrational desires of reproduction. If a society is not structured to acknowledge these inherit differences, it will ultimately crumble.

Pointing out anomalies is far less useful than pointing out the generality. The generality is what one will encounter in almost all of the cases, and is therefore the non trivial evidence. Anomalies are the trivial evidence.

Point is that women stay for different reasons:

- they think they are being ""strong"" by staying - they think if they endure the bad parts of their marriage, he'll change and the marriage will be solid again.
- they have kids and think the kids need their dad and a father figure in their lives. They don't think they'll cope alone with the kids.
- they're afraid to leave because he says he'll kill them/kill the kids if they do - and they believe him.

Most men already react to women who complain about not getting into relationships with this degree of antipathy. Although generally the reaction is less 'and what have you done to earn my resources m'lady' and more 'maybe she'd have more luck getting a boyfriend if she didn't look like she'd eaten the last 5' or similarly critical commentary.

I'm not quite sure yet about my feelings on the overall topic... 

I think women can care about men's non-sexual issues, ie unemployment, war, homelessness - to roughly the same measure that men care about women's non-sexual issues. And when it comes to women's sexual issues, men already don't care to roughly the same amount that women don't care about the men's. You see it all the time here, men lamenting that women can't even be incels - they deny there is a problem to the same extent women do. This seems roughly ""fair"" to me, I don't see the need to spread the non-caring to other non-sexual issues."

>What do you think about legal discrimination on gender?

Same as above. Should be done away with. 

>Do you think someone would take offense to this? In that case, who?

Absolutely. I can share some anecdotes from my own life and interactions with others. I was once loosely involved in a mostly left wing online political community where a trans woman (or a person claiming to be a trans woman) just kinda showed up one day. This individual immediately started with harsh anti-male statements backed up with radical feminist theory (including TERF arguments). Most of the female, male, and other trans users in this community very much wanted to be seen as good feminists and only a few objected to this. Over time, what was a group of socialists and communists turned into a community based entirely around radical feminism with the primary goals being: 1) figure out a way as quickly as possible for women to reproduce without men and 2) also focus on ways to prevent men from subjecting women to their sexuality until 1 can be accomplished. This trans individual cited their experience/impulses as a person with male levels of androgens until age 15 as proof men are biologically disposed to violence, subjugating women, and subjecting others (primarily women and children, according to this line of thought) to their out of control sexuality. I objected to this and presented scientific literature that contradicts (or at least calls into question) this (popular) assumption about androgens. I was quickly ridiculed by most of the community, told the science is settled on this, and when I asked for their evidence that contradicts what I had presented I was told (this trans radical feminist person claimed to be a biologist, BTW) that only a fool would want to ""duel abstracts"" and that scientific literature about androgens in mammals proves that this isn't up for debate. On another occasion when this trans radical feminist person (and other trans followers) were questioned about why they like Mary Daly so much despite her views that are pretty widely accepted (even by many feminists) as transphobic. They responded that the goal for trans women should not be to break down barriers between men and women but to be accepted as women even by TERFs and to candidly share the reality of what it's like to have to live with androgens (from their time prior to undergoing HRT). 

I'm telling all this to say: even trans people who you would assume would support something like this (and, let's keep in mind, trans people are the group things like this change in Norway are usually designed to benefit), are not in agreement about this. I think in some ways the acceptance of trans women has just made gender identity even more rigid and some prioritize being anti-men and desperately wanting feminist acceptance (especially TERF acceptance). Of course, not all or even most trans women are this way I suppose, but most of them do seem to adopt the sort of mainstream mild misandry we can all observe in society today (if they engage with men they talk about men as ""fuckbois"", how they are or wish they were ""queer"" so they wouldn't have to deal with men, assume all men are pursuing them, etc.)."
14283,"Have you, or are you planning to enter any women's only spaces? I'd imagine that would be by far the most controversial thing you could do, especially with bathrooms/changing rooms (also is it technically illegal now for you to use men's?)."
14284,"Well, that is one way of increasing the number of women in STEM. Which 18 year old man in Norway wouldn’t do this to get extra gender admission points to a number of STEM studies? This could possibly wreck havoc on the tool of giving women candidates preferential treatment. I wonder if it’s just as easy to change back to male after a few years or even months.  

Getting a new personal id (combined with a name change) may also seem like an attractive way to try to get away from any debtors. Although this could be handled by ‘folkeregisteret’ returning all prior id-s when queried for one id. "
14285,">and though I'm not the very image of a gender conforming guy, I have experienced little in the way of dysphoria.

This wasn't relevant to me. And I'm a trans woman. I wasn't very feminine before, and I'm not very feminine now, either. If I was trying to pass a feminity course where I need to be properly stereotypical, I would fail. But I would also fail a masculinity course. I never really cared and it wasn't the reason to transition.

>What do you think about legal gender?

It's stupid, irrelevant except for doctor, and only rarely. Should be removed, and only on your medical file (not your medical card).

>Do you think someone would take offense to this?

I'll take offense to the differing treatment. Not to someone taking advantage.

It'd be nice to do like a week long battery of tests involving two dozen professionals for two weeks to determine whether a given individual is able to make decisions on their own instead of relying on some arbitrary cut-off point tied to the day you were born.

I don't know how obvious this is to everyone else, but to me it is pretty obvious that there's nothing special about almost exactly 18 or 21 or however many revolutions of the Earth around the Sun that makes the brain suddenly be able to take decisions on its own. It rather seems likely that some people are able to act and think like adults at 13 and others can't even at 30.

But in practice, a crude test of ""are you 18 yet?"" makes society able to function and the perfect test battery doesn't.

Similarly, gender allows crude distinctions that work for something like 199 individuals out of 200 (according to the most ""trans-generous"" data I can find). It is very practical and useful. Segregating prisons by gender prevents a shit ton of sexual assaults, I guarantee it, to give an illustrative, if colorful, example.

Gender exists regardless of it being practical or gender roles existing. You could have a single bathroom, gender would still exist, and no it wouldn't make the bathroom spontaneously combust (and I'm talking about a multi-stall one). Skirts could be as gender neutral as pants and gender would still exist.

The differentiation is not necessary for the world to function, it just more or less naturally happens anyway. The enforcement is the problem. For example, there is no issue with most men not wanting to be fashionistas and being drab most of the time. There IS a problem with employers and schools making short hair a condition to have you because penis. 

Most men having short hair - is neutral. Men being forced to have short hair - is evil. See the distinction?

14312,">we legally have the right to decide when/if we become parents

Now, this area of law becomes murky--I thought about bringing it up earlier, as an example of laws that apply harshly to women and not at all to men--but it's difficult, as this entire subset of laws can *only* apply to the biologically female.  Is it a large set of examples where laws are applied only to women (to their detriment) but not to men..?  Yes, but due to biology.  

So, it isn't that there's a law that states that ""men don't have the right to decide when/if they become parents, only women, based on their gender.""  In fact, only being *biologically* male causes you to be unable to decide what to do with any pregnancy you are responsible for; if you're legally male, but biologically female, you absolutely have the same ability as anyone else who is legally female *and* biologically female to decide what to do with any pregnancy you are responsible for--only biological males don't.  

Legal manhood would also be no actual legal *protection* for you, for example, if you were *biologically* female, pregnant, and found yourself in one of the following scenarios:

>pregnant women have been arrested under fetal-harm statutes after falling down the stairs and driving with blood-alcohol levels of just half the legal limit. Other women have been forced against their will to undergo caesarean sections, or spend months on bed rest.  In Wisconsin last summer, a pregnant woman named Alicia Beltran was taken to court in handcuffs after refusing to take an anti-addiction drug for a painkiller habit she had already kicked on her own. The court initially ignored her requests for a lawyer, but appointed a legal guardian for her 14-week-old fetus.

So, murky.  This whole conversation interests me, though--it's made me think about the fact that we are all our gender in three different ways: *legally,* *socially,* and *biologically.*  Most of us *are* the same gender in all three categories BUT, not all of us...and each component of gender can have very different, and even sometimes clashing, effects on the other(s)."
14313,"Well, in the States (unfortunately, I have to keep bringing that up, because I can tell from your post that Norway's sufficiently different that I can't make assumptions about what it's like there, vs. here!) it's a big bonus in most professions, especially STEM professions, to be male--people assume you're competent much more easily and they are much less likely to sexually harass you on the job and you are likely to be making more money as well, especially if you're a parent, which is in a large part due to the societal expectations, lifelong training, and social penalties of being female.  When you're trying to purchase something, especially the most expensive somethings like cars and houses, salespeople are much easier to deal with when you're socially male...frankly, in nearly *any* sort of business transaction, you're treated much more successfully (for you) if you're male.

Think of things like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/6y7rpm/13_policemen_withstanding_the_flow/) gif. What are these police officers doing? They're there for crime prevention.

How do they prevent crime? They're not patting everyone down or anything. Why not? Because it's just not realistic to do so. People wouldn't go to events if getting in took ten hours because everyone needed to be pat down.

So in practice, the officers have to use crude heuristics to spot potential criminals. They'll look at things like whether people ""look like they want to fight"" or ""look shifty"" or all sorts of ""boxy/categorical"" characteristics.

This is the kind of practical things that crude/wrong/discriminatory/boxy rules serve. We can still find plenty of cases of people unnecessarily questioned/detained/whatever as well as robberies/assaults/etc still happening despite the policing. The point is not that these measures are perfect, but rather that they're much better than nothing and that ""better"" measures are unpractical (it's useless to have a perfectly safe event if no one is going to come because of how tedious and lengthy the procedures involved are).

Sort of. I recommend reading the [section on paternity leave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity_leave_in_the_United_States#Paternity_leave) regarding U.S. policy.

I was active duty when my daughter was born, and I was given 10 days of paternity leave. Any more than that and I had to take standard leave (which I did, because fuck that...I took 4 weeks off including the paternity leave).

And in the civilian world, the situation is similar. Even if they can take the time off, the FMLA only requires *unpaid* leave. So from a practical standpoint, most families simply can't afford to have both the mother and father in an unpaid status, especially after their first child. And due to biological reasons it generally makes far more sense to have the father working and the mother taking care of the child, both due to the long postpartum recovery and the ability to breastfeed.

This leads to a de facto situation where men don't really get much in the way of paternity leave, even if they have the ""right"" to it."

Even assuming both those arguments were true, would you agree that it should be legally regarded as equal to tattooing a child (which clearly has only a cosmetic effect) if effective vaccines or cures were developed for those diseases, which did shift the medical benefits to below the risks of harm? 

There are two sound arguments for allowing nontheraputic circumcision, although I agree with neither. One is a balancing of rights which places parental authority and freedom of religion above the religious freedom of the child and his bodily integrity. IMO that’s a bad choice and contradictory to most western countries’ general trends of child-related law, but American norms haven’t moved anywhere near as far in favour of the child so it is valid there. 

The other is based on the concept of group rights, in which some subset of the community hold rights as a group and where those rights are weighted above rights which are otherwise held be individuals. That’s the basis of apostasy and such like laws, and they were largely abolished in the west but have been creeping back, supported mostly by self-identified Progressive movements.

They accepted as relevant the sub-Saharan HIV trials, which aside from disputes over methodology has other problems when applied to the west, where most HIV+ people are on ARVs, the predominant strains are less effectively transmitted by PIV sex, where safe sex is the norm in high risk situations, and because white men appear to be less vulnerable to that avenue of infection. 

They didn’t make any allowance for the reduced risk of HPV following the introduction of vaccination, nor for Canadian results showing that if you correct the urinary tract problems which cause most of the  UTIs which circumcision avoids, circumcision doesn’t help. (The latter may be because of poor availability or affordability in America.)

They didn’t take into account any pleasure derived from direct stimulation of the foreskin. 

One of the AAP’s authors said that they were writing it with consideration for the the social and political consequences and bearing in mind the role of parental discretion, which is valued far more highly in the US and in any case isn’t really within the proper scope for a medical recommendation so wasn’t considered elsewhere. 

Also American practitioners have a cultural inclination towards removing anything not  essential whenever there’s a possibility of a problem, and although that’s reduced somewhat that’s still a cultural bias. 

Lastly, they just weighted all the considerations in favour of circumcision more heavily than everyone else and those against less heavily. You could say that they’re right and everyone else is being defensive and biased, but that wouldn’t explain those men from countries where it used to be common. "

14402,"Yes they're safe together, neither is listed as an interacting agent with the other; they're also both common OTCs so I'm sure many people have taken them together before you. "

Acetaminophen,
dextromethorphan HBr,
doxylamine succinate,

That's Tylenol, a cough suppressant, and a very similar antihistamine.

Still very safe to take. If your goal is to stop coughing, the dextromethorphan  will assist. The guaifenesin makes the coughs ""do something"". The Dextro slows them unless necessary. 

Be aware that taking both antihistamines may make you sleepy, but it's still not dangerous at all. Babies and pets can be given those antihistamines when needed without harm - specifically in the equivalent doses mg/kg.

I'd personally take it without thinking twice."

I used a Dr. Scholl's freezing device and it went away and never came back.  Does this mean that my body cleared the strain of HPV for this wart in the same manner it will likely clear a genital wart?

Also, because this bump is not on my penis, could I actually use the Dr. Scholl's device on it?  Or maybe something like apple cider vinegar?  I'm a little embarrassed to even bring the question up to a doctor (even though I have great insurance and could probably go in).

The one stat that still bothers me about this is that only 1% of people currently have genital warts.  This kind of goes against all the evidence I've read that it is such a common illness.  Maybe the 1% stat takes into account the fact that people are clearing the warts in 6 months - two years?

There seems to be so much misinformation.  And there are some sites that just seem plain wrong - like fd.valenciacollege.edu/file/sagustin/HPV.ppt: ""There is currently no cure for human papillomavirus. Once an individual is infected, he or she carries the virus for life even if genital warts are removed.""

I guess that may be people conflating incurable for a short period of time (like the flu) to having the virus for life.  But then again, sites like that exist.  This is pretty stressful lol.  "
14418,"Common in the sense of HPV, but do you also mean common in the sense of genital warts?

That's what is confusing me.  What if the common forms of HPV clear but genital warts is not considered a common type (only 1% of the population has it)?

A doctor wouldn't think twice about a plantar's wart or a non-wart causing STI version of HPV, but what if genital warts are a big deal and don't clear.  There seems to be a ton of misinformation."

It says that even though HPV can be cleared, it can remain dormant and then reactivated any time later in life.

And this is actually from an MD:

""One reason is that many HPV infections clear up on their own without causing any problems, and it’s possible that a woman who tests negative for HPV still harbors a dormant form of the virus. ""

“HPV never leaves your body,” said Dr. Laura Corio, an obstetrician and associate professor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. “It can come out various times in your life.”

Is this just really unlikely, or is it possible?  I mean, I don't think the flu remains dormant and people who get the flu once do not get the same strain again later in life."

14433,"Hi Beddarhalf,

While I appreciate that you are trying to start a discussion I have a couple of suggestions which might make it easier for others to understand and respond to your argument in a thoughtful and clear fashion.

First, please give a clear statement of what your argument actually is.  What you've provided is a collection of links to various articles with some connecting sentences.  Are you interested in how Adventism treats LGBTQ+ people?  Whether such an approach is Biblical?  Why people are LGBTQ+?  Whether vaccines are safe?  Whether chemicals can impact sexuality and genetic expression?  These topics might be connected in your mind, but the connections are not clear to the rest of us.

Secondly, please focus your questions towards topics pertinent to this subreddit.  THis subreddit is for discussing Adventist community, practice and belief.  Exploring the Adventist response to LGBTQ+ people is relevant.  Exploring the science behind vaccines and the biological impact of chemicals is far beyond the scope of this subreddit.  While scientific evidence might be relevant to a particular discussion, few of us have the knowledge, training or experience for extended discussion of scientific debates.  Please respect that.

Finally, and perhaps least importantly, please take care with your sources.  Although it is unclear what your argument is, the links you've provided don't particularly seem to support what I think you are arguing (and you haven't explained why you think they do).  That chemicals have an impact on genetic expression is hardly a debatable idea.  However, the fact that certain African frogs ""change sex"" when exposed to certain chemicals says little about human sexuality.  Homosexuality has been practiced for centuries--long before modern chemical production and usage.  (And have you ever seen Jurassic Park?)  The last piece of research you present, about contaminants in vaccines again has nothing to do with homosexuality.  It is presented as being concerned with quality control and possible side effects--which may be highly variable.  To clarify, I'm not interested in debating these points with you, but simply in illustrating that that they don't seem to provide much support for what I think is your argument.

Please take care in your posts,  We're happy to have discussions, but a good post will get better responses than this has garnered."
14434,Go away and get your kids vaccinated
14435,It doesn't matter if anyone was born any certain way. We are all sinners. I've seen some children act cruel from a young age and never grow out of it. They aren't excused for assault or murder. Having a tendency toward homosexual desires does not provide an excuse for acting those desires out.
14436,"The push for soy that the SDAs are known for certainly isn't a step in the best direction.  You are probably on to something, but all the research is so darn inconclusive so far.  It generally isn't safe to say *""hey, there is a correlation here, let's assume that it is causal in nature!""*"
14437,"There was something about BPA plastics back in the nineties that was feminising men. Feminised boys, makes who look feminine are told by peers and even adults - from a very early age they must be gay. 'Girlie boys' taunts and teasing and innuendo. The indroctinisation can be relentless, they hear it often enough from males who look more manly than they and from older adults who ought to know better and they see feminine looking/acting 'gay' men in the media and begin to believe it must be so. Feminine young boys/young teens attract the predators like lions to a lamb. When the prepubescent males earliest sexual encounter happens to be a male then the formation of sexual inclination might well swing fully to identify as gay. Gayness is nothing more than skewed preference. Just as pedophilia is a warped preference. There is nothing scientific about personal preference. Saying you are born gay is like saying I was born a broccoli fan. "

Agreed. Vegetarian should include mainly vegetables. But many non-meat eaters do not enjoy vegetables and therefore they are not true vegetarians."
14442,"I understand. Yet, I have been trying to address this ""born gay"" position in a way that doesn't give in or accept that sin as excuse to compromise Gods law. And on your point of gays in their childhood, of all the gay males that I have met none of them have survived their childhood without being molested. I don't know how that figure goes for all gay males, but of the several gay males I've met they have all been molested.
I've gathered this information a above so that the church can fight back on the Gay born motive, without guilt. If it is true that one is born gay, lets ask how and why instead of accepting it. My saying that they are born gay they somehow I want to make it God's plan or God's fault. But there are people born with one arm your people born retarded there are people born addicted to cocaine their people born  with many habits and different Brokenness. None of that it's God's fault or God to blame. None of it is especially how God planned it to be. And yes there's so much harm and Plastics expecially when heated. These are more of the endocrine disruptors. Many foods such as processed cheese and milk travel through endocrine disruptors in plastics. Finally I have met some mothers who so much wanted a girl that they indoctrinated their last son as such and encouraged them to be gay."
14443,"Why on earth would you give your kids pesticides? Also I've had all my vaccines. Just got a flu shot last week, and somehow I'm not a raging homosexual."
14444,Leafy greens are really important too.
14445,"The issue is our own propensity to run opposing to God not walking in harmony with Him. People who identify as homosexual are just as much saved as people who are self righteous and sanctimonious. Once you decide to fully commit your whole self to God, to follow His Son and walk in His ways, sin begins to peel away. We become right with God as we walk in harmony with Him by following His Son. Homosexuality falls away just like every other wrong desire. Desire to gossip, desire to take another's property, desire to bear false witness..all the stories I have ever heard from every self identifying gay people has one commonality, early sexual interference by a much older person.

14446,When we feed our children non-organic Foods we are giving them pesticides. We are taking risks. Your argument is not with me. Investigate the matter yourself see what the scientists are saying regarding dangerous in vaccinations. The internet is available for all of us to do our own research.
14447,Pure gospel. Thank you. I was fed by your comments.
14448,All the scientists that are worth listening to say vaccines are safe
14449,"I think I understand what you're trying to say. I think you are saying that if you agree with the scientists, then they are worthy to be listened to. I see you haven't touched pesticides and their effects on gender. Or chemicals that alter a person at the DNA level."
14450,"Pesticides and vaccines are 2 completely different things. I agree that we should be using less pesticides althought that's because they can cause health and environmental  problems, they arent turning people gay."
14451,"Actually, he could also just be referring to the [nearly 90% of scientists](https://www.vox.com/cards/vaccines/does-scientific-community-support-vaccination) who not only agree with the benefits of vaccinations, but who also believe they should be made *mandatory*. But maybe I'm just projecting here.

Please note that I have spent a lot of time doing what you're saying no one is doing -- researching and reading about subjects like this and have over a decade of experience and training for doing so --and I *still* feel as if I don't understand everything that the 85%+ of scientists who believe in mandatory vaccinations do. 

Essentially, I do hear what you're saying and I understand your concerns. And while I may disagree with where you're at now I do respect that you put in the time and effort to do your own research. But I would also caution and implore you to look at vetting your sources as well as to look at the bigger picture and conversations that are happening among the communities of people who have literally dedicated their entire lives and have decades more experience and expertise in these matters.

Also, please understand that the studying of facts often doesn't yield a conclusion that's starkly contrasted as black and white. Often times, instead, you're left weighing the amount of truth on one side vs the amount of truth on the other  (e.g. Causation vs correlation, the burden of proof, statistical risks on both sides, etc). Realizing this will allow you to make much better-informed decisions about essential things such as health care in the future (I think you're on the right track in terms of process, but sometimes not asking the right questions can lead you down an entirely different path). "
14452,"[Here's an opportunity for you and others to learn more about this serious matter](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1281309/).
>Although scientists have postulated a wide range of adverse human health effects of exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), the nexus of the debate is the concern that prenatal and childhood exposure to EDCs may be responsible for a variety of abnormalities in human sexuality, gender development and behaviors, reproductive capabilities, and sex ratios. Scientists today are asking hard questions about potential human effects: Do EDC exposures impair fertility in men or women? Can they cause sexual organ malformations, stunted reproductive development, or testicular or breast cancer? Do fetal exposures to EDCs alter sex phenotypes? Do they change later gender-related neurobiological characteristics and behaviors such as play activity and spatial ability? Could such exposures even be involved in the etiology of children born with ambiguous gender.

And again, Nothing Stops each individual from researching the matter for themselves."
14453,"One question I'd like to ask people to see if they are really informed regarding vaccinations, is have you ever read the ingredients of vaccines and the CDC warnings and the manufacturer's own warnings on vaccines?"
14454,Yes. Thank you. I'll keep these considerations in mind.
14455,"So, 2 questions:

1) homosexuality has been around since before vaccinations were invented. So what was the causal link at that time that would've accounted for this, and what evidence do you have that there has been a significant uptick in non-heterosexual behavior or orientation preferences since the introduction of vaccinations?

And 2) do you know that the actual percentage of people who identify as non-heterosexual is only [7%](https://www.thedailybeast.com/just-how-many-lgbt-americans-are-there)? And yes, this includes pretty much every orientation besides heterosexual. 

Now, compare that with the often [90%+ of the same exact population that receives vaccinations](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/immunize.htm) (70% if we're talking the entire 7-series vaccination). Essentially, given that fact, how do you account for that much of the population not having a deviation from heterosexual orientation while receiving vaccinations? Also, mind you, this assumes that absolutely 100% of non-heterosexually oriented people have all received their vaccinations (which is extremely unlikely).

"
14456,"""One thing both scientists might agree on, though, is that right now there are still more questions than answers.""

By all means lets study the chemicals we're using. But the health benefits of vaccines are proven and most people who eat fruits and vegetables don't get turned gay, and even if they did they are no less deserving of love and respect, you know, the way jesus treated people."
14457,"To answer your question, yes. I have. My follow up question is: assuming you have as well, do you understand everything regarding the mechanisms and essential functions of each ingredient held within those vaccines?

I ask this, because of another fundamental misunderstanding I hear come up within the hospital from patients every now and then regarding a drug called Warfarin. Several patients have accused this drug of having rat poison in it. And you know what? They're actually right! Sort of. The drug consists of ingredients which act as an anti-coagulant (basically, if the blood is not flowing as it should, or has reduced to sludge etc, then administration of Warfarin allows the flow of blood to return to its normal state). But in rat poison, the dosage of those same active ingredients is not proportioned out with the intention to free up over-coagulated bloodstreams, it's designed to take an already healthy bloodflow within the rats and accelerate its flow to an insane level -- essentially bleeding the rats to death.

Basically what I'm saying is, don't just start with reading ingredients and warnings. Half-truths lead to a fundamental misunderstanding of the fuller picture of things (which can be extremely dangerous). Instead, immerse yourself fully in the process you already started and allow your new discoveries to change your viewpoints when merited (which will happen often if you continue to learn). "
14458,"No medical procedure is without risk. But the risk of not vaccinating outweighs the risk of vaccinating. Also, I know for a fact you don't know better than medical professionals who have dedicated their careers to studying this stuff."
14459,"I see you too avoided the topic of chemicals and pesticides and went straight to vaccines. I also noticed that you turn the question into the increasing number of homosexuals. When the topic is actually whether or not one can be justified in saying that they are born homosexual. And to ask the reader to investigate how an individual is so-called born homosexual and if it has anything to do with human DNA tampering.

But so you won't be disappointed here are the data that you requested.

>An [increasing number of children are born with intersex variation (IV; ambiguous genitalia/hermaphrodite,]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017538/) pseudohermaphroditism, etc.). Evidence shows that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in the environment can cause reproductive variation through dysregulation of normal reproductive tissue differentiation, growth, and maturation if the fetus is exposed to EDCs during critical developmental times in utero. Animal studies support fish and reptile embryos exhibited IV and sex reversal when exposed to EDCs. Occupational studies verified higher prevalence of offspring with IV in chemically exposed workers (male and female). Chemicals associated with endocrine-disrupting ability in humans include organochlorine pesticides, poly-chlorinated biphenyls, bisphenol A, phthalates, dioxins, and furans. Intersex individuals may have concurrent physical disorders requiring lifelong medical intervention and experience gender dysphoria.

That's not my intention. My intention is to put scientist to the test of the Bible. Is their medicine really accepted as medicine for the believer? We can determine that by the ingredients. We're only dealing with the uncleanliness of the animals and humans used in vaccines. I doubt that most readers knew that human fetuses are used in vaccines.

>But in rat poison, the dosage of those same active ingredients is not proportioned out with the intention to free up over-coagulated bloodstreams, it's designed to take an already healthy bloodflow within the rats and accelerate its flow to an insane level -- essentially bleeding the rats to death.

What I'm most happy about is in this discussion you readily admit that the feces of the mouse is used in vaccines. And through our discussion many people who don't know as much as you do regarding the ingredients and contents of vaccines or reading for the first time what is actually in there. This will spark greater curiosity and investigation. But spiritually do you care what God has to say about consumption of the mouse? If one could not eat a mouse do you think God would it be okay with one injecting anything from a mouse?

>For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh: and the slain of the Lord shall be many.  They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord .
Isaiah 66:16‭-‬17 KJV


You go on to say...
>Instead, immerse yourself fully in the process you already started and allow your new discoveries to change your viewpoints when merited...

There are some things I'm personally not willing to immerse myself, but to each his own. For example dung. Dung is used in vaccines. Look what God has to say about even walking in the mist of dung. Therefore godly people know it certainly should not be used in medicine.

Deuteronomy 23:12-14
>""You shall also have a place outside the camp and go out there, and you shall have a spade among your tools, and it shall be when you sit down outside, you shall dig with it and shall turn to cover up your excrement. ""Since the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp to deliver you and to defeat your enemies before you, therefore your camp must be holy; and He must not see anything indecent among you or He will turn away from you.

Next you say
>(which will happen often if you continue to learn).

It is not that I cannot learn. I agree that there must be some benefits to the harmful vaccinations created by the scientific Community. I'm not unlearned in this.
But once again you are arguing whether or not  man can get his medicines to work.  That is not my argument. My argument is whether or not they work or can be made to work the vaccines are unclean for the Christian.  Christ would not inject  a vaccine into himself that contains  rat  feces  rat sales  pig sales monkey sales  or blood of any kind. Christ would not have us inject into ourselves  aborted  fetuses. Christ would not have us use abortion which kills is a method of keeping another human alive. So the scientists make it there medicines to somehow work, the scriptural violations or too numerous for it to be called Godly accepted medicine. 

Lev 17:11
>For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life.


[Further discussion on not consuming blood multiple texts.](https://www.openbible.info/topics/eating_animal_blood).


I leave you with this text over trust in physicians instead of God.

He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.  But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.
Revelation 21:7‭-‬8 KJV

The word here translated sorcerers comes from the Greek word for pharmacy or medicine doctors. I'm demonstrating here if there is an ungodly medicine that is harmful for the human and unclean for the Christian."
14461,">To answer your question, yes. 

I can see that you have investigated the ingredients of vaccines. I'm glad for you. I can also see that you answer the question for r/writing_emphasis. And we are yet to see his answer. You left out whether or not you have investigated the warning labels from the vaccine manufacturers themselves and from the Center of Disease Control. Assuming you are aware of those too that's great for you. But many of the readers here are for the first time looking into the vaccine ingredients and for the first time looking at the manufacturer warning labels  and the CDC warnings. Now they will be able to better make informed decisions. Now readers in general will be able to question is this medicine really medicine? Or is it witchcraft?

And I think that you yourself have for the first time seen that vaccines can alter DNA and alter the hormones controlling feminine and masculine qualities. Is that true? Have you known that before? And if you did realize that before is that okay with you, that vaccines can influence changes and masculine and feminine hormones?"
14462,"Since you know the ingredients of some vaccines can you answer whether or not God would consider it clean or unclean to inject green monkey liver into our blood systems? How about human embryo? Should Christians and inject human embryo into their blood system? What about serum (blood) and cells from unclean animals should we inject that into our blood systems?

Look at these [7 ingredients and answer which one would God consider clean medicinal purpose?](https://vactruth.com/2013/10/28/7-disgusting-ingredients/)"
14463,"Did you realize that ABORTED human fetuses are used in some vaccines? How does square with you? (what about cow blood, mice dung, green monkey cell, swine cells?)"
14464,As an Adventist do you know better than the medical professionals about eating healthy? Do you know better than 90% of scientists about the benefits of Sabbath? Do you know better then the professionals regarding abstinence from alcohol? The scientific Community will tell you that masturbation is healthy do you no better about that?
14465,">I see you too avoided the topic of chemicals and pesticides and went straight to vaccines.

Actually, what I did was take a look at the bigger picture which you're specifically ignoring here as well since both those chemicals and pesticides that you're referring to apply in the exact same way to what you're discussing (and not choosing to talk about, and instead deciding to argue semantics that amount to the exact same points anyways). 

>I also noticed that you turn the question into the increasing number of homosexuals. When the topic is actually whether or not one can be justified in saying that they are born homosexual.

I noticed almost no one (as evidenced by the current top comment) actually knows what you're also arguing in the first place. The point I addressed actually has something to debate whereas what you're claiming your argument actually is doesn't actually become an argument or debate at all given the evidence you're eliciting since, again, *non-heterosexual orientation existed prior to everything you're talking about* (again, see previous point if more reference is needed). 

>But so you won't be disappointed here are the data that you requested.

Actually, I'm still quite disappointed since you still have yet to actually address *any* of my questions or answers to your questions directly. "
14466,">I see you too avoided the topic of chemicals and pesticides and went straight to vaccines.

That's because pesticides are harmful and everyone knows this.  If it turns out that pesticides have a harmful effect on child development, even a hormonal effect, few people would be surprised.

But vaccines?  Give me a break.  Certainly, some rare individual vaccines may be problematic.  But vaccination as a whole has saved millions of lives around the planet.  Vaccination stopped Smallpox, and vaccination put a serious dent into Polio.  Even Jehovah's Witnesses accept vaccines, and they're the ones who are crazy enough to refuse blood transfusions."
14467,"Ok. So once again, we have another instance where 95%+ of what you wrote about I, again, specifically addressed so, like I said before, please refer to what I've already written to you to find that relevant response (also, please stop trying to make parts of what I said sound like me agreeing with you when, instead I'm attempting to provide you a proper context and show for you the fundamental misunderstanding of your knowledge regarding drugs such as Warfarin). 

But as to your comment on Revelation (the only theological response that comes from the part of the Bible that I haven't addressed yet): I'm actually very glad you've gone into this territory since I've actually gone through seminary and studied my theology enough to be able to point out that the original greek word that you're referring to (specifically ""φαρμακοῖς"" or ""phármakos"") specifically does not actually refer to pharmacy or medicine doctors as you claim. Literally the only thing that the word φαρμακοῖς has in common with pharmaciats or medical doctors at the time is that they used drugs in their religious incantations. This is a fundamental misunderstanding that comes from anyone that sees the part of the word ""pharm"" and tries to automatically connect it to the modern use of the word ""pharmacy/pharmacist"", then tries to then use that initial (and erroneous) connection to I use the term ""fundamental misunderstanding"" because if you try to pair the original greek term used in Revelation with the modern terminology for doctors and pharmacists, you'd very easily and clearly see that they are not even close to the same. Unless you think, for some reason, that todays doctors and pharmacists align themselves with this definition:

>""properly, a sorcerer; used of people using drugs and ""religious incantations"" to drug people into living by their illusions – like having magical (supernatural) powers to manipulate God into giving them more temporal possessions.""
-HELPS word studies

I would also point out that you're also dominantly using the version of the Bible that is based off of pre-discovery of the dead sea scrolls as well, bjt that's another matter entirely, and not completely relevant to our discussion.

Also, I know I've said this multiple times already, but I feel like repetition in this case might be near-imperitive. Please, if you want me to actually reply back anymore at all read *everything I wrote first* in response to you *before* throwing tons of texts at me that already have been addressed. Again, I have shown you the respect of not trying to take your words out of context (either in their entirety, or by taking only portions of what you've said and restructured the framework to mert my own desires) as you have with mine already, and I only ask that you do the same. If you cannot do that, then I'm sorry, but I don't see how I can continue discussions with you. And yes, I realize that doing so runs the risk making you think you've somehow ""won"" some debate or something, but I'm imploring you here to see the larger picture here and determine the reasons behind my decision to expend this much time and energy addressing you in the first place (because, as an aside, it hasn't been to ""win"" any sort of debate). "
14468,"Yes. I've worked pretty closely with pharmacists, and I'm more than aware of the warning labels. That being said, launching off your assumption that modern medicine and pharmacy is ""witchcraft"" let me ask you this: do you think the witches in the days of the Bible printed warning labels for their potions? Or even verbally warned them of the contents of their spells and potions? And, (since I know the answer to this question, as I'm sure you already do as well) why do you think they didn't?

What I'm saying is, too many people (it's a small number of people, but it's still too many) refer to things they don't fully understand as ""witchcraft"" ""devilry"" or ""magic"". Why? Because it's simpler to apply that label instead of investing years of learning and education to understand the more complex and in-depth machinations that lie behind the functions of what they're talking about. Please, I beg of you, don't do the same. Step up and *truly* finish the journey you've just stepped into and finish your course of learning into a deeper and more informed conclusion. Because where you are *is* a beginning; but like many journeys, if you stop at the beginning of the path, you'll never even come close to seeing what the entirety of the rest of the world that you've stepped into looks like. "
14469,"He doesn't say anything about it either way. As exhibited multiple times throughout the new testament as well, I would point you to what Jesus, Peter, and Paul all discuss as being the thing that simultaneously and actively fulfills and substitutes the more specific mosaic/jewish law (e.g. As exhibited in books such as Leviticus). They point to the guiding of the Holy Spirit within situations similar to the one we're discussing here (which also relies more heavily on our own agency than before in humanity's history). So I think you're, imo, asking the wrong question by asking specifically where or what God says about injecting a specific substance into our systems. Once you start asking those questions, there's infinitely more questions that you can also no longer answer in lieu of the process and responsibility of reason and discovery that God has given to us to pursue. 

Also, you still haven't answered my initial question even though I've answered both of yours. I'm still curious what your answer/thoughts are regarding the functions and machinations of those ingredients. "
14470,There's no way that's true. And even if someone wanted to make vaccines out of aborted fetuses i can't imagine they could scrape together enough baby parts to make that happen.

Current scientific data supports adventist beliefs. They aren't at odds with each other. Most nutrionists would say the adventist diet is healthy. Pretty much everyone is in agreement that you can't work 7 days a week. The health risks of alcohol are common knowledge and as for masturbation, its completely normal, healthy, not addressed in the bible and you sound like you could use some.

14473,">Actually, I'm still quite disappointed since you still have yet to actually address any of my questions or answers to your questions directly.

Respectfully, in the articles provided, you see that the scientific Community admits that vaccines do alter and change and affect a person's gender by the changes the DNA, which is passed on. If you have read any of the research docs that I sent, are we able to agree that vaccines do alter the DNA and vaccines do effect the hormones that control masculine and feminine qualities? I'm not here to fight with you I'm showing you that even the scientific Community is looking into these things what is your response to that? What is your response to their research that does show testicular changes and the research that shows that due to vaccines girls are having an abundance of testosterone? That through vaccines males are having a reduction in testosterone? I'm dealing with the topic directly by addressing the scientific articles.

Let me hear you respond to the feces, human embryo, and blood in vaccines. Do you think that that is medicine? Because I feel that that is not only a violation of God's clean and unclean laws, but it is definitely related to sorcery as you cited here."
14475,">because, as an aside, it hasn't been to ""win"" any sort of debate.

Neither am I here to win a debate with you. I actually respect you. And though our conclusions differ I am glad for the knowledge and admissions you have made concerning the ingredients of vaccinations. This for me makes the whole journey worthwhile. Because it causes readers to investigate the matter for themselves.

>misunderstanding of your knowledge regarding drugs such as Warfarin

I do not have a misunderstanding of warfarin. My understanding is that unclean elements should not be used in clean medicine. Not even if it is beneficial. You may have a different take on that. But still it gives the reader an opportunity to see both sides."
14476,">He doesn't say anything about it either way. 

So you claim God has nothing to say regarding unclean animals taken into our bodies?
You are able to view Gods abominations here.

>They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in abomination.  But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.  And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.  And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even.  The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you: every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.  These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind,  And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the snail, and the mole.  These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the even.  And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood, or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.  Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean.  And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown, it shall be clean.  But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.  And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.  And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination; it shall not be eaten.  Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are an abomination.  Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.  This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth:  To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten.
Leviticus 11:11‭, ‬23‭-‬26‭, ‬29‭-‬32‭, ‬36‭-‬39‭, ‬41‭-‬43‭, ‬46‭-‬47 KJV
http://bible.com/1/lev.11.11-47.KJV

Your focus is on the benefits of science whether from clean or unclean animals including human fetus. My focus is in scripture and the separation from clean and unclean. Worldly medicine (vaccines in particular) is WITCHCRAFT. God does not need to go to the unclean animal to heal humans. If you believe that we can use any animal in any fashion just because it may have nutrients or because it may help heal some facet of illness then it would be okay to eat pork or shrimp or catfish because they do contain nutrients yet for the people of God they are unclean.

"
14477,I guess you discovered otherwise
14478,">and why your arguement is stupid here

You're strong reaction demonstrates you are embarrassment due to your ignorance regarding human fetuses in vaccines.

>There's no way that's true. And even if someone wanted to make vaccines out of aborted fetuses i can't imagine they could scrape together enough baby parts to make that happen.

After saying it's not true you soon discovered that it is true. So the origin of vaccines is from aborted human fetuses. And that is from the document you sent me.

>Other common vaccines, including those for chicken pox, hepatitis and rabies, are also propagated in cells originating from legally aborted human fetuses, according to the FDA.

If in your mind you think it's okay because the so-called original human cells were garnered over 50 years ago that doesn't make using aborted fetuses okay with God. It is unclean.

I didn't see your response to whether it squares well with you about the use of human fetuses, animal feces, animal blood, and monkey kidney cells? Are those all okay with you?"
14479,">Current scientific data supports adventist beliefs. 

In some cases scientific community supports Adventist understanding. But in many cases there's a mixture. For example the scientific Community feels that it's okay for us to eat any seafood or even eat pork this is against the Adventist diet. This world would have you believe that a day of rest at any point in time is okay or you can choose to rest on any seventh day that you like. But that is not what scripture tells us.

>The health risks of alcohol are common knowledge

The medical community is always trying to get us to drink more or to declare that alcohol is good for us so I have to disagree with you here.

>and as for masturbation, its completely normal, healthy, not addressed in the bible and you sound like you could use some.


I'm actually surprised and quite disturbed by your response here. This demonstrates that the source of your wisdom is not scripture or bible-based or with respect to Ellen White. But it is from another source.
[Maybe you disagree with Ellen White here, but the science does not.](http://www.fulcrum7.com/apologetics/2016/1/26/ellen-white-on-masturbation-new-scientific-verification) 

>The young indulge to quite an extent in this vice before the age of puberty, without experiencing at that time, to any very great degree, the evil results upon the constitution. But at this critical period, while merging into manhood and womanhood, nature then makes them feel the previous violation of her laws. ( A Solemn Appeal, Ch. 1 “Appeal to Mothers”) 

>In this passage, Ellen White is saying that masturbation does not seem to do great harm to pre-pubescent children. But when those children reach puberty—“while merging into manhood and womanhood”--the negative effects of pre-pubescent masturbation are manifested.

>A clinical study done in Jordan and published in 2010 in a Saudi medical journal has found that pre-pubescent children who masturbate have significantly lowered levels of estradiol. [ Ajlouni, et al, “Infantile and early childhood masturbation: Sex hormones and clinical profile”  Ann Saudi Med . 2010 Nov-Dec; 30(6): 471–474]  


Masturbation [ruins marriages] (https://www.growthtrac.com/masturbation-ruins-great-sex/)
>While the Bible is not clear about masturbation, it is clear about lustful fantasy. In Matthew 5:27-28, Jesus teaches that thinking about another woman lustfully is adultery. If you’re looking to justify masturbation, you’re going to have to ask yourself what you think about when you do it. Bringing yourself to orgasm while thinking about anyone to whom you are not married is, according to Jesus, adultery. Thinking about some sexual scenario and achieving an orgasm to those thoughts conditions you to what sex could be like. This is dangerous in that it sets up unrealistic expectations for what sex with your wife ? or future wife ? should be like.

>Don’t be self-righteous and think, “Well, I masturbate, but I only think about my wife. That isn’t adultery.” Do you think about actual past experiences, or do you project into the future: “Wouldn’t it be great if she would only?”? Thinking in this way only sets up unrealistic expectations and dishonors your wife. 
"
14480,"See, everything you just wrote serves as a direct contradiction to everything you've been saying so far to people here. You've been trying to point to scientists and science so far, and yet you literally just drafted a response that speaks entirely against ""the scientific community""; so I guess I'm asking you to make a choice. Are you actually trying to use objective scientific facts (e.g. Your entire initial post) to prove your points? Or are you choosing instead to go against the scientific community instead (e.g. Your entire comment drafted to me here?). Because you can't have it both ways unless (as you so aptly put it to one other user above):

>I think I understand what you're trying to say. I think you are saying that if you agree with the scientists, then they are worthy to be listened to."
14481,"You literally completely ignored anything about the actual refutation to the theological point *you yourself brought up*, and tried to pivot right back to the science you're still not decidely for or against. I just don't understand it. Like I said before (and I'll let this stand for all the other responses since the same is true for those as well): until you decide to actually and directly address the answers to the questions you yourself have posed, this isn't a conversation. A conversation involves a dialogue of mutual respect between two people. You're continuing to not only ignore any and all points I'm providing for you, reframe contexts of what I'm saying to suit your own needs, and erroneously using scripture in the same exact vein. All to prove a point for which you have no basis for, but for which you've stodgingly chosen to hold on to all for the sake of ""being right"". So I'm sorry that my attempts to actually dialogue with you have to come to an end. I honestly do still wish that you can come to separate your desire to be right from your walk towards actual learning, but until then, that's all I can give you. "
14482,"You should probably actually read through everything I wrote in response before posting all your lengthy replies because you'll find that I already addressed the responses to this and your other points already, so 1) you're just talking past and at me without actually reading my responses and 2) that makes anything I have to say redundant in response.

That being said, I'll at least point you in the right direction by pointing out specifically to how the vast majority of what you chose to quote at me is ironically from the *exact book of the Bible that I very directly addressed by name*. So please, actually read my response before replying and actually have the respect to directly respond to the questions I posit in direct response to your own points and questions as I have done for you. "
14483,"So i did learn something today. I didn't know that the cells used in vaccines trace back to legally aborted fetuses, but as the article i linked pointed out, there is basically nothing left from the original fetus. I dont find this problematic in the slightest just as i have no issue with organ donation. We used the body of a deceased individual so that others may live.

As for the issue of being unclean, vaccines are tested and proven to be safe. I don't know all the ingredients of vaccines, but if what your saying is true and they're full of rat shit and witch's wart and whatever else, the ingredients serve a purpose and their amounts are safe for injection. I'll take a safe amount of rat shit injected into my arm over smallpox, polio etc. any day of the week.

I consider these diseases to be much more ""unclean"" than any of your listed vaccine ingredients. "
14484,That's actually a funny reply I will let it sit.
14485,"This is another attempt by you to congratulate yourself for putting up with me and reward yourself for even spending time with me and then to use personal attacks of my so-called limited understanding and your Elite deeper level of understanding to discredit. But you have not addressed the issues in the articles. You leave it untouched. A simple yes or no with explanation, will do. Do vaccines alter a person's DNA which is passed on to offspring? Do vaccines both diminish and increase hormones such as testosterone in humans and in animals? "
14486,Oh how I have been honored to be honored by you and the time that you gave me.
14487,Just to be clear these were not deceased individuals these were killed babies. And as far as you feeling that it's okay to take them at least you do it is an educated person now. Everyone has the right to make their own decisions but those decisions should be informed.
14488,One more question. Are you certain that vaccines prevent the diseases purported? In other words will vaccinated persons be immune to the diseases they are vaccinated against?
14489,Killed babies are deceased individuals.   Abortion is an incredibly complex issue and you can't make blanket statements about it. 
14490,Yes
14491,Okay.
14492,"[21 of 411 out of 411 vaccinated high school students get measles. That equals 100% vaccinated people] (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000359.htm).

See
Measles Outbreak among Vaccinated High School Students -- Illinois

>From December 9, 1983, to January 13, 1984, 21 cases of measles occurred in Sangamon County, Illinois.* Nine of the cases were confirmed serologically. The outbreak involved 16 high school students, all of whom had histories of measles vaccination after 15 months of age documented in their school health records. Of the five remaining cases, four occurred in unvaccinated preschool children, two of whom were under 15 months of age, and one case occurred in a previously vaccinated college student (Figure 5).

>The affected high school had 276 students and was in the same building as a junior high school with 135 students. A review of health records in the high school showed that all 411 students had documentation of measles vaccination on or after the first birthday, in accordance with Illinois law.

This is one example to show you that vaccinated people are not protected or immune from vaccines."
14493,"I don't disagree. Vaccines aren't 100% effective. That's why we need herd immunity to mitigate instances like this as much as possible. It's all about reducing risks, which vaccines are great at."
14494,"Great. r/writing_emphasis my intention never was to argue with you on these things. I honestly hope that you would be concerned; maybe even outraged at the possibility of some vaccines/pesticides targeting the human at the genetic and gender level.

If there is medication to keep us safe from the diseases we all want it. But we do not want to be harmed by endocrine disruptors. Would you agree with that?"

These findings also raise important questions about the effects of vaccinations on intersex or trans individuals, who may have had surgery and or hormonal treatments. This could raise problems when measuring doses based on sex, when the medically recorded assigned sex of the person may not reflect the hormonal or physical changes after birth. It would be very difficult to predict the optimal dosage of various vaccines to achieve high levels of immunity and low levels of adverse side effects for each case, trans and interex people especially. It is especially tricky to determine the effects of immunological and hormonal differences in these individuals after they have undergone changes to their body. "

14500,"HPV is **very** common. According to some CDC statistics I found, about 40% of sexually active adult women and 45% of sexually active adult men were infected *at the moment.*

Given that HPV actually usually cures itself in almost all cases within several years, you can imagine the risk of getting it in your lifetime is high--I saw one study that said 80% to 90% of adults get it within their lifetime. That's *crazy* high. The vast majority of cases don't develop any issues at all.

By the age of 26, its assumed that you already have had it. 
"
14501,"No, there’s no biological reason. They don’t recommend the vaccine past a certain age because they assume that by that age that both men and women have had enough sex where they have already been exposed to the virus and wouldn’t benefit from the vaccine. 

Also, there’s a cutoff age for the MMR vaccine because the original vaccine came out in ‘63, meaning people who were kids before that year were most likely exposed to measles’s and have life long immunity due to the antibodies already being present in their body. "
14502,"Really good answers. I'm just adding to the consensus so far.

There are around 40 types of HPV that infect epithelial tissue of human bodies with lots of mucous. That ends up being anogenital area and mouth/throat.

But of all those, there are fewer than a dozen that are common culprits in HPV related cancers and genital warts.

For men, there are exactly 4 that are particularly concerning; 2 that cause 90% of genital warts and 2 that cause 95% of all HPV related cancers in men.

Women are a little different. The same 4 cause most problems in women but the uterine cervix is susceptible to damage by several more strains.

And those 4 strain responsible for most of the problems in both sexes, are pretty common.

Most people have their highest number of sexual partners in their 20s and therefore experience their highest incidence of HPV infection. The types that cause cancer don't cause any obvious symptoms so most people never know they've been exposed. 

You may not have been exposed to all types by the time you're 26 but you're also less likely to be as sexually active.

"
14503,"ridcullylives has it right.  The vaccine protects against initial infection.  It cannot help if you already have the virus.   If you are a sexually active adult who was never vaccinated, you already have the virus."
14504,"Also, the cancer caused by hpv tends to be slow growing. That means, if you are in your forties, are exposed, are unable to clear it, there is still a long you're before it can start to cause changes to your cervical cells.

Pretty much everyone, all the time, has cancer in some cell in their body - our immune system takes care of it. Additionally, there are cancers that we recognize that almost everyone with get, but they are more likely to die **with** not **of**. If a woman lives long enough, she will get breast cancer, but likely it will be slow growing, unlikely to metastasize, and she will die from other causes before it is a problem. Same thing for many men with prostate cancer. It's one of the dangers of over-testing, you will find cancers that don't need treated and the treatments are more likely to kill you than the cancer itself. "
14505,"Exposure to one strain doesn't give you immunity to all strains. The vaccine protects you from the most problematic strains. It stands to reason that most people don't have all strains of the virus.

""They probably already have 1 or 2, so we wont vaccinate them against the other 14"" seems pretty counterproductive if your goal is to dramatically reduce long-term health issues in adults."
14506,">...you already have the virus.

Should probably say you already **had** the virus.

>[Studies have shown that more than 90% of new HPV infections, including those with high-risk types, clear or become undetectable within two years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html) 
~CDC"
14507,"That is false. Not everyone who is sexually active already has the virus.

Also, age =/= number of partners. "
14508,"The other thing is, at least according to the CDC, getting it when you're older *doesn't* seem to reduce long-term health issues according to clinical trials. Modern medicine is big on avoiding unnecessary procedures--both for cost's sake and because it's generally safer. There's already a procedure for testing for the dangerous effects of HPV infection (the pap smear) and its very effective if done regularly."

No, ofcourse not, BUT then don't complain about it when it's the other way around. Stop telling men what they should be attracted to, what you are doing all the time with your omnipresent gynocentric propaganda and stop shaming men who have preferences, regarding attraction towards women themselves. Legalize and regulate prostitution and don't criminalize men who have to pay in order to get sex then. Stop shaming men who are virgins or are using sexdolls for their relief. This would be some things you COULD do.

Oh and ofcoure don't demand quotas in the workplace! What should employers do? Hire women who are less suited for the job than a man? That woud be stupid, wouldn't it? Don't demand from society all kinds of free things and supports for your female convenience. What should men do? Pay for your shit? With their hard earned money they could use to pay a prostitute or buy a sexdoll instead because you are not attracted to them? Pay for your things yourselves!"

We don't need to ""prove"" that men are capable of establishing and supporting their own autarkies. It's obvious to anyone with a functional brain."
14516,"Wow! It's been a long time since I've learned a new word. ""Autarkies"". Thanks!"
14517,"Use condoms and test often is the standard in the community. Not saying that's necessarily the safest, but that seems to be the most prevalent approach. If you decide dental dams, condoms for oral and gloves are a must, insist on playing that way. Swinging adds risk, there's no doubt about that and there's no way around that. Everything in life carries risk. You just need to determine how much risk you're willing to take on for the enjoyment the activity gives. Research as best you can and go in informed. 

You say you're more aware of health in your 30's. Well guess what...so are most people at that age and most swingers are in their 30's and older. I doubt any study about swingers is representative so I would take anything purportedly about swingers with a grain of salt. The swinging community is very tough to nail down. Any study would be limited to those willing to admit to swinging and willing to participate. That would be a very skewed subset of the swinging population. Personally, I believe the swinging population is safer than the singles scene because they tend to be family types with responsibilities that lead them to be more health conscience. That's a personal belief only. Like I said, I doubt most studies about swingers.

Test and test often. Ask others about how they stay safe and their testing habits. Even if they show recent, clean tests, it proves nothing because things have an incubation period. However, it does show that they test and any issue they came up with could be addressed quickly. Determine a schedule of testing for yourself. Whatever interval you decide is right, stagger the tests between you and your spouse. That way, one of you is getting tested every half an interval.

No one can convince you to take the risk. That's only a decision you both need to make. Just research. The CDC has great resources for STD information. Jump on their site and read."
14518,"Besides testing and condoms you have to establish your own levels of risk tolerance; somewhat like you both did back in your teen and college dating with the possibility of pregnancy.

Most of us in the lifestyle for a decade or more, ike hubby and I, have become comfortable with the possibility that we will get a few over the years.  Hopefully, like clamedia that is treatable, but also herpes as a large part of the general population have it and condoms don't cover completely.  Some with herpes actually don't know it.

Its somewhat like snow skiing. You know you might fall off the lift, hit a tree, break a leg or worse, but you do it anyway.  Just like  most people screwed around back in your teens."
14519,"Honestly there is nothing my wife and I do now that we didn't do when we were single - we wash hands, wear condoms and perform unprotected oral.

Honestly I think that our risk in the swinger community is lower just because you have less sex. When I was single, sometimes I had a new partner every 2-3 weeks. Now we're lucky we can find the time to play at all.

I think our last encounter was sometime in mid-June. And we've had just 5 full-swap encounters since the start of the year.

Compare that to one weekend when I was single in 2014 when I had sex with 3 different women in 3 days over a long weekend in the summer.  

Hell, swinging is probably safer just because you do it less."
14520,"One model for basic risk analysis looks at **likelihood** and **severity** of particular outcomes. When managing that risk you look for ways to mitigate (reduce) one or both of those variables.

**Likelihood** (simplistic): Do some research on incidence (how many people have it) and transmission rates (chance of transmission per sex act). Multiply those by the number of sex acts and you get the likelihood of infection over time.

Ways to mitigate likelihood:
- Discretely inspect your play partner's fun bits (yay oral!)
- Always use condoms
- Play with other people that always use condoms

**Severity**: I have low concern about HSV-1 (effects are generally minor; ymmv), moderately concerned about chlamydia (because greater effects, though generally curable), and very highly concerned about HIV (because I'm a child of the 'AIDS epidemic' era).

Ways to mitigate severity:
- Regular testing (so you can start treatment, if available)
- Stay generally healthy (often reduces effects)

So using data at https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2015/04/30/std-statistics/ (***which I totally haven't verified***), assuming swingers are representative of the larger US population, and no protective measures are used, I get the following example likelihoods of transmission for twice monthly swinging over 10 years.

HSV-1: 3.7%
Chlamydia: 1.9%
HIV: 0.000296%

Assuming you always use condoms, these drop to:

HSV-1: 3.7% (assumes no condom effect)
Chlamydia: 0.00265%
HIV: 0.00000296%

So there is a small, but real, chance someone will transmit HSV-1 to you (though 65% chance you are already positive). And basically no chance of Chlamydia or HIV so long as you always use condoms.

That drop in Chlamydia transmission convinces me condoms are worthwhile mitigation. In contrast, the extremely low likelihood for HIV transmission tells me taking PrEP isn't worth the cost.

Do your own research and calcs.

EDIT 2: I picked three example STDs. Other STDs exist, of course, and should be considered.
EDIT 3: More formatting."
14521,"Everyone has a different level of risk that they are willing to accept for each situation or person, and any contact with others will involve some level of risk. Safest, as you call out, is of-course is no-contact, but that's not very popular. Condoms, dams, etc. offer a serious and strong level of protection. Obviously, not using them for any specific activity increases your risk, all the way up to no protection. 

You will find that people have all different levels of risk that will accept. Some require full barrier play, others are condoms only, others are nothing. Some people have clear detailed medical history and reputations for honest disclosure, others literally 'just got off the bus' and no one knows anything about them. You can't judge properly by appearances. 

I am no longer surprised  at the number of couples or singles who say ""condoms only"" and in the heat of the moment those rules go ""out the window"". 

What you should both do is to perform your own personal risk assessment of what amount of risk you are willing to accept with different people. There will be one for people you know well, another for people you newly meet who you feel are a social-grouping you relate to, and yet another for people you are less familiar with or comfortable with (people outside your experience/comfort zone). Work through the possible scenarios, figure out what level of risk is right for you both, and then own it. 

This will make it easier and less stressful because you will have a set of personal 'rules' to follow, won't have to make a call 'on the fly', and can easily and readily explain to a potential partner what you require for safety. Of course, don't change the rules in the heat of passion, or these rules will quickly become meaningless.

...and when I say ""own it"", if you do end up getting something unexpected, even after following your own risk management, then you own it and don't regret and decide after the fact ""oh I should have NOT followed those rules"". Make sure the risk levels you are willing to accept are really ones where you are willing to live with the potential consequences. We are all adults and taking personal responsibility for our actions and decisions is a big part of playing our role as adults. "

14524,"Great answers everyone, I'm once again impressed by the interactions within this community, offline and online!"
14525,"Thank you for your valuable answer. Everything you say makes sense. And yeah, probably not all studies are correct, but I think it can be useful to look at some data about prevalence and risks. If the standard doesn't protect against certain things, of which some probably are not even tested, then some ignorance about the details seems necessary to proceed. Which is fine I guess if there's no other option.

Since you mention testing, can you detail what tests exactly are considered standard? In the country we live in healthcare is pretty standardized, and from what we read STD clinics usually test chlamydia, gonorrhoea, HIV and syphilis. They don't seem to do other things like hpv or herpes by default, only ""when necessary"" (whatever that means). I suspect that's because of a combination of high prevalence, lower risk of leading to serious problems and cost-effectiveness. Is that the standard everywhere?"
14526,"So you've been doing this for more than 10 years and so far you didn't have any serious problems? I know it's not really scientific to generalize from just 1 datapoint, but still hearing this is encouraging. Thanks for your message!"
14527,"Good point. Definitely frequency is a factor, but you have to consider the frequency of the people you play with too I guess.

When exactly do you wash hands, you mean just before playing, after, or when switching partners (that doesn't sound too feasible)? Is that related to STDs?"
14528,[deleted]
14529,"Wow, that's some really interesting data, thanks for sharing!"
14530,This is great and informative. Thanks for posting!
14531,"Those are some very good points, thank you. In a way that's what we're trying to work on, this risk assessment strategy, but we find it hard to find data on which to base it on. I realize this is not exact science but it seems a bit like people set rules for their peace of mind, with little data to evaluate how much their rules actually protect them. I guess while nothing visible happens, that reinforces the idea that those rules ""work"". However, the standard rules don't seem to provide any protection against some things with high prevalence, not usually tested and sometimes with no immediate symptoms. But sure, if these are current medical limitations, I guess the only strategy that remains is to ignore them for now, ""own it"" and hope for the best."
14532,"One more thing: if you don't mind, can you give a short example of the 3-tier set of rules that you describe?"
14533,"HSV and HPV...now you've hit the hot button topic around here. Honestly, I'm sick of talking about them because no matter what you say, someone gets needlessly fired up about it. I will just suggest you research as best you can about them. It is safe to say doctors don't typically test as part of a standard panel, you need to request it. The test when you're asymptomatic is an antibody test. When you have a suspected site, the doctor swabs it and that's a much more definitive test. "
14534,"If I have my fingers in one woman I wash my hands before I use those fingers on another woman.

"
14535,"It's risky to go from one woman to another with hands and/or toys without washing them (in antibacterial soap)... I have a sensitive hootie as it is (prone to yeast, UTI's, BV, etc), so my husband and I use condoms for penetration ALWAYS (not the ""condoms always"" then don't actually do it in the heat of the moment kind), and are very careful about the hands as well. We are both always watching and paying attention to ensure that hands and toys are not going into me that were previously in someone else. We've been in the lifestyle since January and haven't had any problems (and we've been gettin' around! LOL!). We've been tested twice already because we're also ""anal"" about the STD thing, and our doctor is willing to do complete STD checks as frequent as every 3 months if that's what we want (which we do). It's only a $20 copay for a ton of peace of mind! At some point our insurance company may complain about the frequency and we'll have to go to once every 6 months (the more common practice for promiscuous people), but for now we're going in every 3 months and it's working great for us.... 

We definitely understand your interest and concern on this subject.. It's hard to justify putting yours and your spouses health and body at risk of all these various infections and such, in order to mess around with other people (since of course yourself and your spouse are #1)... BUT, the risk is worth it to some! It's more than worth it to us, and we're pretty darn touchy on the subject!That's really what you're looking at here... deciding how much risk you're willing to assume, with very little data to base it off... We DO know that condoms for penetration, lessen the amount of risk, exponentially. Also, the amount of risk involved in transfer of STD's through unprotected oral is extremely low. Let those facts be your guide....... We don't feel a need to use protection for oral, just because data shows that the rate of STD transfer that way, is actually very, very low. We ALWAYS use condoms for penetration though, because there IS a lot of risk in unprotected penetration. Data shows us that condoms drop that risk substantially... Another thing we pay attention to, is whether or not our prospective play partners use protection. Many swingers openly express that they prefer not to use condoms for any kind of sex (and we appreciate when they're upfront about that, because it allows us to assess whether or not they are a match for us, much more clearly). Looking for swingers who testify to always practicing safe sex, will of course lower your risk even more (to one extent or another, but like you said, there's no data.. this is not math, just common sense)....

Lastly, you can also rest at ease knowing that the majority of swingers are older, mature, have children, jobs, homes, etc. They care about their health, AND yours, a lot more than singles in their 20's probably did.... 

(Edited typo's and grammar issue)"
14536,"> Even with controls it is still medium for an average swinger imo.

Maybe (depends on assumptions). The more pertinent assessment *for me* is that with condoms and a testing regime the risk of negative health outcomes is very low."
14537,"Everyone is different. Just have to find your comfort point. Most couples in the lifestyle require condoms for penetration, but may do oral unprotected. Some couples may require nothing with another couple they are close friends with and trust and play with regularly. Some couples need more assurance. Some are more comfortable with more risk. Everyone is different, define your own comfort zone."

14549,also worth noting that it's more a big deal for him (or any person with a penis) giving HPV to a girl (or anyone with a cervix) than it is for him to have it since HPV has variants that can cause cervical cancer.

The oropharyngeal cancers affect men 76% more often than women.

14563,"I'm not a lawyer, but I am a doctor! I have some info about what happened here.

First of all, it was previously thought that IUDs would be too painful for women who have never had children. However - that is no longer thought to be the case. They're even coming out with new IUDs that are smaller just for this reason. If this really happened just this past summer, your OB-GYN absolutely should have known this. I know lots of women who've never had kids and have IUDs!

Secondly, regarding what happened with your pap smear. Here's a link to the official OB-GYN group (ACOG) and their patient information for pap smears: http://www.acog.org/Patients/FAQs/Abnormal-Cervical-Cancer-Screening-Test-Results

The part I'd look at is Table 1, the part that shows what follow up should be done for which age group and what pap results. It's hard because I don't know your age and I don't know exactly what your pap showed. (I tried to copy/paste the table here, but I couldn't format it correctly.)

I hope this helps you! It's always good to have more information. Regardless, it was wrong of her to say you couldn't get an IUD, and definitely wrong of her to not show you the test results. You may have a case here."
14564,"Wow. That honestly sounds like malpractice, and malice.

Absolutely go to someone new and get their opinion on your situation.

Are any of the CF-friendly docs on the list near to you? Not sure if they would be experts in the issue of dealing with a potentially improper procedure, but perhaps they can help with getting you to the most expert doctor in your area.

As far as potentially suing the doctor, if you have good medical evidence against the doctor then there is a good chance that either you could get some help from a non-profit patient's rights sort of organization (ideas anyone?) or that a lawyer would take the case either pro bono (free) or on a contingency (they get a chunk of the settlement from the doctor's malpractice insurance.) If she is found guilty, she could lose her insurance or potentially her medical license. 

 "
14565,Lawyer. Up. NOW.
14566,"While the comments made by the doctor were pretty heinous and should be reported, keep this in mind:

1. Some women experience a considerable amount of pain and sensitivity after cervical biopsy (colposcopy), LEEP, or cone biopsies. I had problems for about 2 years post-LEEP and still have recurring sensitivity problems. I've spoken to several doctors and read supporting evidence in recognized medical journals. The cervix is a weird contraption and scar tissue can produce varying results.

2. The doctors push for the vaccine because it works. It's not a shady consortium of kickbacks or revenge for you not wanting kids. Yes, your doctors comments were complete horseshit, but the alternative of having continuous procedures and more frequent exams well into your 30s sucks and can become costly. I've heard reports of ""adverse effects"" that were no more than coincidence, misleading VAERS statistics, and those trying to discredit the vaccine from a Merck exec's quote taken out of context. Had it been available when I was younger sweet Christ I would have gotten it in a heartbeat. Sometimes dysplasia clears and you get a brief statement from the doctor (common). Unfortunately, sometimes you require more than a few colposcopies and move onward to more invasive surgeries.

3. If you have had success with oral or easily reversible contraception, many OBs will keep you on it. If it ain't broke, so to speak. For the most part, docs are pretty good about suggesting IUDs these days, though, and listening to YOU, the patient. If your doctor felt you would be in a great deal of pain to get an IUD, sedatives should have been given as an option. If they don't feel it's a good fit, they need to back it up with evidence.

4. Vasovagal response is common after colposcopy. I passed out after my first one and the doctor (at the time, not my current OB) failed to even mention that I should have hung out a few in the waiting room with some water afterward. 

5. Doctors release a clear or not clear statement on dysplasia. If it becomes more serious, your doctor will provide more information about the level of severity, risk, and treatment options. It sounds like this doctor was not being clear or communicative, but they usually don't release full pathology/lab reports unless it's warranted. 

6. Discharge is common post-colposcopy / biopsy. Sometimes further irritation occurs like you experienced and again, simple issue for the doctor to explain and treat with a dose of diflucan. Just ask for a one pill dose of diflucan. Problem solved.


If some doctors spent some time explaining these things in the first place and not belittling patients, life would be much easier. But, alas... Time to report this bad egg and move on. Another tip is to try seeing a nurse practitioner for check-ups, paps, and regular visits. They are more thorough (from my experience) and more communicative than some of the OBs pressed for time between deliveries and surgery. "
14567,"Oh my god.  Absolutely horrifying.  I am so sorry you went through all that pain and are still having pain from the biopsy. It sounds like you were treated really badly. I'm glad you don't plan on going back and I wish you luck in finding a better doctor.  

It sounds like she was shady from the start (when you mentioned sterilization).  Changing the subject so abruptly and trying to sell you the vaccine, scoffing at your interest in an IUD, then trying to sell you on nexplanon.  It also seems suspicious to me that she was unwilling to produce the test results for HPV.  The nurse even laughed at your problems post-biopsy.  Appalling. 

I know you say you could never afford to sue, but I think it's a good idea to keep records of what happened, just in case you are able to at some point.  

If it were me, I would want to write a strongly worded letter to them about how disrespectful and callous they were, and that I was never coming back.  But that's your call.  

I hope your new doctor can help you heal.  If possible, you might want to have the new doc check for HPV.  Second opinions are a good thing, especially after that other doctor acted so sketchy.  And if you find out that they were wrong, and you don't have HPV, you might really have grounds for legal action. (Disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer or a medical expert.) 

Also I was just wondering about your medical files and if they will be transferred over to the new doctor when you switch.  If so, maybe your HPV test results are in there somewhere.  

Edited to add:  It's hard to know if she changed her manner because you mentioned being childfree, or if she was just trying to sell you stuff.  Or both.  But the timing is weird. "
14568,"What the everloving fuck. 

When you get better, and not just physically, I imagine you're mentally wrecked at the moment as well. **Get. A. Lawyer.**

Denying you from your own medical records is illegal. I imagine that procedure was not needed - malpractice. If you can prove this was all done because of your desire to not have children (you shouldn't have trouble with the lawyers subpoenaing the records) then that's a much bigger case. That joke was disgusting and the fact that she refused to treat you for her own procedure says a whole lot. 

This doctor is a monstrous cunt and needs to have her license stripped. "
14569,"I agree with all of the opinions given here. Also, you were lied to about IUDs. Itʻs not comfortable but itʻs not that bad."
14570,"I am sick reading this! I have never ever, for any reason had my medical files denied to me.  Your gyno is a LIAR.  Part of me believes she did this to you to make you not want the IUD.

Fuck that noise, you need to find someone in charge of these people, and sue, complain, leave a bead review, anything.

This just solidified for me that I will never ever visit a gynecologist.  Never been, not going now."
14571,"You need to report this. I'd fucking sue if I was you. It's illegal to not fully explain a procedure to a patient. It's illegal to perform a procedure with no cause. Even if you had hpv, a biopsy is not the best option always. It's illegal to perform a procedure and not treat any after effects (like it never healing). Go to a walk in about the yeast and biopsy. If it has not healed you need to be seen asap. This is completely unprofessional treatment. It's against every code of ethics doctors swear to. She should not have a license to practice. If you don't report her, she'll probably do this to many many more people. "
14572,"Jesus FUCKING Christ! Could you report her to the board? She needs her FUCKING licence withdrawn!
It sounds like she was torturing you to prove that you can't handle the pain of an IUD. She didn't even stop when you begged her to? That bitch FUCKING molested you! 
Omg, I am raging so hard right now!"
14573,"This post literally enraged me. Sue that mother****er, that's all I'm gonna say."
14574,"What the fuck??????
What the everloving fuck????
Was your doctor some kind of sadist? Girl, I am so sorry you had to go through this shit and I hope you get better soon :(
I am 100% sure your doctor forced some malpractice on you. You are entitled to your medical documents and she should have explained them to you in detail. And if she is performing some kind of treatment on you, she should have explained every step and paused if you felt too much pain.
You should definitely complain and talk to a lawyer.
All the best!"
14575,"This sounds like a malpractice suit in the making. You are most certainly entitled to copies, if not originals, of your OWN medical records as well as your billing records with few exceptions under HIPPA. Also, the fact that they will not see you for your follow on pain issues this far after the procedure is an extreme red flag. Nurses are not to make birth control jokes, everything about this is infuriating. I would just find another doctor period to make sure your bits and pieces are ok and get a second opinion and then look into lawyering up if you feel you deserve it because that is bullshit. "
14576,Call an attorney. There's a malpractice suit right there.
14577,Sue. 
14578,Lawsuit time. 
14579,"Being in the Medical Field...I absolutely hate when doctors apply their own feelings and agendas ahead of their patient's needs. This is 100% and absolutely reportable to the Medical Board for the state in which you live. It's not the same as suing, but it will definitely give the board her attention, and she will have to address the situation. 

Not only that, but this is also reportable as a HIPAA violation for refusing to provide you with copies of your own medical records. This would be the part worth suing over, and I bet with the right lawyer, you would most certainly win. 

Speaking from experience as someone who has had the painful biopsies, useless tests, and horribly inserted IUD's... you need to do some research, and find a better GYN under your health plan.  Be up front and honest with them about what has happened, and let them know that you would like to start over, and re-establish a base of care. If you call someone now and tell them you are still bleeding from a biopsy, they may be able to get you in sooner. 

PRO-TIP - if your current GYN is part of a large corporate type health system...purposely find another doctor outside of that health system.

Best wishes, and I'm so sorry you went through this. "
14580,"So I see you've said you don't have money for a lawyer, but medical malpractice is a big issue and you were a victim of it. These ""people"" caused you lasting physical trauma and they need to pay.

  It may be a good idea to Google and check out any local attorneys in the area, some one might be able to help you get some justice. You might also want to report that office and ""Doctor"" for malpractice. If she did this to you, then she could and might do it to another person. 

  I'm so sorry that you went through this. Doctors are supposed to help, not hurt. If you're in Cheyenne Wy, I know some really good and gentle ones that would help for real.

  "
14581,"Will check with my GP to see how out-of-date my experience was.  I had a cone biopsy around 1987.  I was brought in for Pap smears every 6 months for so many years after that to ensure I was clear.  I was put under a general anaesthetic for the cone biopsy, then spent a few days at home before returning to work.  I had no idea you could perform a biopsy without a general (were you given a local? anything?).

Fast forward 25 years or so.  Naturopath took me off birth control pill.  Started having the heaviest, most painful periods ever.  GP inserted a Mirena.  Now no periods.  I think I had some discomfort at first, but it was done in July of this year and I don't remember anything (keep in mind, was in severe pain before insertion).  I was warned insertion would be painful, but I was walked through what would happen when, it wasn't fun, but not much worse than a Pap.

At the time, the OB/GYN would have sent a copy of test results showing need for biopsy, plus report detailing biopsy, to my GP.  Does this not happen where you live?  Also, am Canadian, can no longer go to OB/GYN 'just for Pap'.  GP does this now, every 2 years (not every year).  So I can't ask an OB/GYN about this, only my GP.

I would also agree with the person who said that if you switch to a new, human OB/GYN, you should be able to have your records transferred.  Once the records have arrived, tell the new doctor (or better yet, the receptionist) you will want copies of the abnormal Pap and the report regarding the procedure.  Don't mention lawyers, just say you want these for your records.  That's all you need to say.  I would not get into blaming the old OB/GYN unless the new OB/GYN ever makes the comment ""what the hell happened here"" or some such.  You don't want to have the new doctor think you are a problem patient who will sue them too, you want the new doctor to look you over and see how things look, describe current symptoms and see if something else is going on.  Keep as calm and unemotional as you can in the appointment and exam.  Start with getting healed first, then after that, discuss your wishes with regard to ongoing options (IUD or permanent solution).

BTW, it was years after the cone biopsy that a new OB/GYN told me I'd had HPV.  I was all ""WTH???"" and he said ""that's why you had the cone biopsy"".  Damn straight I would have had the vaccine if it was available - I faint during shots, but better that than the cone biopsy/general anaesthetic.  Shocking to someone my age that there finally is a vaccine against one type of cancer, and people are refusing it!  Your body, your choice though.

Happy to answer any questions about Mirena, and what I can remember about the cone biopsy.  Get yourself healthy, then kick that cruel twat's twat."
14582,"What's amazing to me here is that she had a problem with you being CF. When I got my IUD (by the way, Mirena is a smaller IUD which was specifically designed for women who have never had children) my doctor was kind and seemed even a little proud of me for taking control of my own future. It's responsible to seek long-term birth control and it can be removed whenever, so I don't understand what was up that doctor's ass. 

Switch care providers, and ask them to work with you on your concerns (long term birth control, the unhealed biopsied site), and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by the fact that not all OBGYNs are monsters. As a matter of fact, they're usually warm lovely people, who are there because they want to care for women.

I'm really sorry you had to go through all of that in the dark. Also, HPV doesn't guarantee cervical cancer, it just greatly increases the risk for it, so please don't live in fear.

Everything is going to be okay."
14583,"If this is a likely case of malpractice, a law office would likely take your case without charging you anything. They would simply get a portion of a settlement or damages paid. "
14584,You can't just let this go. Report her to every single board that will listen. Don't let her ruin someone else's life.
14585,"P.s., on my phone so I can't quote, but saw your post re: doc has a flawless reputation so you feel like you won't win. My mom just won a $1.5 mil. Malpractice lawsuit against a dentist with a flawless reputation, so don't assume you're stuck.

There are good lawyers out there who'll work properly bono or take pay from the settlement. This is serious maltreatment... I don't often think people should sue, but in your case I do.

Try Planned Parenthood for your healthcare...I've always had such great experiences with them! And don't freak out too much about the HPV thing. 80% of sexually active people have it and we're all just fine."
14586,"First, even if you don't/can't get a lawyer, get a copy of your records ASAP, before they get 'mislaid' or altered in some way. (I'm a bit paranoid if you couldn't tell.) 

Second, if there is any way at all you can, get a lawyer and file malpractice. The ABA has a page:http://apps.americanbar.org/legalservices/findlegalhelp/home.cfm that lists pro bono lawyers by state. Maybe that will help. 

But this woman should absolutely not be allowed to get away with what she did to you. 

BTW, when she said ""absolutely not, we don't give those out"" you should have gotten the heck out of dodge. I've had problems with doctors not wanting to give me copies of my medical records before, and sometimes you have to just flat out say 'Give me a copy of my records.' No asking. 

I'm so sorry to hear you are still in such pain OP. I hope you find a good doctor soon who will fix you up right as rain again. 


This is from WebMD, http://www.webmd.com/cancer/cervical-cancer/colposcopy-and-cervical-biopsy
but still worth sharing I thought: 

""**If** an area of abnormal tissue is found during colposcopy, a cervical biopsy or a biopsy from inside the opening of the cervix (endocervical canal) is usually done.""

But OP said the MD mentioned how good everything looked, so this seems to be a completely unnecessary procedure. "
14587,"What the actual fuck.

You need a new gyno."
14588,"You need to immediately get copies of all of your records at that office and then take them to another gyn and tell this same story. 

There is no way a biopsy should have cause anywhere near that kind of pain. It's uncomfortable, but in no way painful. I'd be curious to find out exactly what she did down there."
14589,"I've had 2 biopsies in recent years because of HPV. While everyone has a different pain tolerance, for me it was only uncomfortable, it should NOT hurt that much and a responsible doctor would have stopped immediately. Nor did I have pain in the following days, let alone unable to have sex. I don't knew what she did to you, but it was not safe practice for sure and her not waiting on you afterwards was also extremely unprofessional. I felt faint after my last one and the doctor personally brought me some sweets and water to calm down and let me lay there as long as I needed with nurses checking on me regularly and herself checking when I was able to finally get up. And I was only feeling faint. You were practically tortured! NO doctor should ever treat their patient the way you were treated and you need to seek legal counsel before she does it to someone else! I'm so sorry this happened to you. "
14590,Lawyer. Malpractice lawyer. 
14591,"I know it's thrown around Reddit often but seriously, that is fucking malpractice. Please just talk to a lawyer, you need to NEVER set foot near that evil bitch's office again and I am so fucking heartbroken for you to having gone through this. Absolutely find a new gyno, tell the receptionist you need a before exam meeting with the doc and explain everything that happened, you need to get looked at by someone who knows how all the stuff down there works, tell them everything you told us, please get checked out and maybe they can help. I am beyond upset for you and am so fucking pissed at this woman, even if she tried to play it off like genuine concern, the way her and her receptionist have handled your concerns since is outrageous. "
14592,"Holy *shit.* She refused to let you see your own medical records, then performed a painful procedure on you without your consent and refused to provide followup care.

OP, I'm not a lawyer; but never mind malpractice: I'm inclined to say this was *assault.*"
14593,"OP, please be aware that *bleeding after sex can be a symptom of cervical cancer.* 

Your doctor may have actually failed you by not adequately testing your biopsy sample rather than by taking it in the first place. *You need a second opinion immediately!!*

See a new doctor immediately to get tested and discuss the treatment you received from this doctor. Please be willing to get the treatment and testing that you need to stay healthy and fix these undiagnosed bleeding problems that you are having.

You are also *entitled* to your medical records, so demand that your old doctor give you those so that you can take them to your new physician.

You can also give your new doctor permission to get those files from your old doctor in case nothing else works. File a complaint if you have to go that route as these should just be given to you by your old doctor on request."
14594,"OP, please please please PLEASE consult a lawyer. This is shady as fuck. If everything you're saying is accurate, a medical crime has been committed. You deserve justice. Please do this for yourself and your significant other."
14595,"You are absolutely entitled to every single one of your medical records, test results and every last letter they have on file for you.

Call them. Demand all of it. If they try to blow you off again, tell them you will be getting a lawyer (it doesn't have to be true, but really you should consider it even if they provide them). Regardless of any of the other ethically unsound things she did to you, denying you access to your medical records is flat out illegal. This sounds like it's borderline loss of medical license stuff."
14596,">It then dawned on me. This sounded like a scare tactic. I immediately asked if I could be given a copy of my pap results. She told me ""absolutely not, we don't give those out"". I was stunned once again. You can't give me the results of my own pap? Are you kidding me?

Your test results belong to you.  You paid for them! If a doctor refuses to give you your lab results you should report them to the medical board in your state, at a minimum.

Your doctor is actually in violation of Federal HHS rules: http://www.aafp.org/news/government-medicine/20140211labtestrule.html

Edit: they are also violating federal law (HIPPA):  http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/consumers/consumer_rights.pdf

You REALLY need to consider seeing an attorney, a HIPPA violation could result in a punitive judgement against the doctor."
14597,You need to sue the ever loving shit out of her. 
14598,"Report that motherfucker. Some people should not be doctors. Have they just dispensed with the ""first do no harm"" bit of their oath? I'm sure there have always been pathetic people drawn to the profession because it gives them a sense of power, but I seem to be hearing about more and more awful, overbearing power-tripping doctors these days.

Just like the abusive cops you hear about (who probably went into that line of work for similar reasons), they give good, decent people who just want to help others a bad name. "
14599,"That's disgusting, you need to see if you can get a lawyer to take your case pro bono if the new doctor thinks that the biopsy was botched. Unless your state has different laws concerning this you should have the right to see your results. I had an issue with my thyroid a few months back and my doctor gave me copys of my blood work and biopsy results upon request. She needs to be stopped, so that she doesn't harm others if it is malpractice. I hope that the new doctor can get you patched up. Check out the CF friendly doctor list in the sidebar and see if anyone's near you, but honestly if you can't find a doctor on board with your child-freeness just go to someone that will be able to help patch you up. You can find a CF friendly doctor later.Also, I have an IUD; I couldn't even feel the insertion. Now there are plenty of women why do have painful insertions, but it'll probably be nothing compared to this horror story. Best of luck, and I hope your new doctor can help you heal up nicely! "
14600,REPORT HER. NOW!
14601,"I won't restate what everyone else has said about how absolutely bonkers this doctor is.  But I do want you to know that I am childfree and have had an IUD put in twice.  I've had one since I was 22.  Yes, they hurt when they are inserted and I bled quite a bit after, but then it never hurt again.  This doctor, in my opinion, was dumb to deny you an IUD based off of that.  I never had any doctor fight me on my choice to get an  IUD.  All they asked was whether I was planning on getting pregnant soon because IUDs are meant to be left in long-term.

I really hope you find a better doctor to help you out."
14602,"Get a goddamn lawyer, and a therapist while you're at it. Shit, I'm going to need a therapist just thinking about this.

What the fuck."
14603,"Wow.

First: yeah, find a new doctor, but you already knew that.

Second: if indeed you do have HPV, it is not a big deal. Only a few strains cause cancer. The rest are non-issues.

Third: IUD insertion was a breeze for me, and I don't get cramps. (Copper IUD, got horrendous cramps before.) Periods are barely heavier than before. Your doc was either misinformed or deliberately misrepresenting IUDs to you.

After you find a new doc, I'd be looking into a lawsuit to compensate for damages...financial damages for treating the scar tissue, and pain and suffering."
14604,"The test for HPV should not have been like that. I had the same test done, and the first test is a small scrape (which can hurt/bleed a little bit), and if that comes back inconclusive, then they can go forward with cutting out a small triangle of your cervix (I think it's called a cone biopsy). I understand that this is more painful, but it really sounds like they fucked up here - like they jumped the gun and went to a test that was probably not even necessary. 

The fact that she isn't taking you seriously/is making jokes is ridiculous. Even if a doctor thinks you are dramatic, they're not entitled to tell you that and then NOT follow up with care.

I do have to agree with the folks commenting that an IUD might not be for you. I personally didn't have much pain after insertion, but did have terrible pain a few weeks later, which eventually subsided. From what you describe, the pain would be too much for you (I hope that doesn't sound judgmental, everyone is different!)

I hope you find help, and I'm so sorry that bankruptcy/other issues are compounding on this problem. I hope you can find another doctor ASAP who will help you out."
14605,"With regards to HPV strain. It's pretty uncommon clinically to actually use an HPV test which will genotype or even quantitate the HPV strain. The test which has historically been used in a clinical setting is called the Digene (now owned by Qiagen) hybrid capture. This test gives a qualitative result for high risk strains. All high risk strains that the test is specific for just return a positive result. There are other high risk strains which are not common in the US which are not included in the panel, and since the specificity is somewhat variable for different strains the results cannot be interpreted quantitatively. There are other tests which might be used that would genotype or quantitate the strain, but they are not typically in use in a clinical setting. This is not to excuse any bad bed side manner, or poor treatment you have received, just to explain why there might not be sufficient information. 
The advice that your fiance cannot give you the HPV strain again is accurate. Once you have that HPV strain you cannot be reinfected, however you can be infected with a new strain of HPV. There are many, many strains and only some of them are oncogenic (meaning likely to cause cancer).  If you have other HPV questions I would be happy to help you in any way I can. "
14606,"I am so, so sorry you had to go through this.  That is some of the most reckless medical behavior I've ever heard of.  I also have had sooo much trouble getting a freaking IUD because I haven't had children.  The first doctor I saw about getting an IUD, which is what I specifically made the appointment for which I told the receptionist, told me *he no longer performs IUD insertions because they only prevent implantation of the egg and not fertilization.*  This hypothetically fertilized egg was given more medical authority over my body than I was.

He also lied and told me there weren't any other doctors at that clinic that performed them except the woman who butchered my mother's IUD insertion, as well as lectured me about how having sex comes with responsibilities and having to remember a pill every day was one of them.

I still haven't gotten an IUD and am so pissed that I have to drive an hour away to get one because the doctors in my network here are quacks and the one doctor I loved who fully supported me getting one was out of my network.

My point is **it should not be this hard for anyone to get a freaking IUD especially if they have insurance.**"
14607,"You know what? You should crosspost this to /r/TwoXChromosomes. This needs to be seen by as many people as possible, unless that make you uncomfortable. This doctor is a nightmare and no woman deserves to be treated this way!"
14608,"Holy shit. First off, you need to call the AMA and your state medical board, because she doesn't need to have a fucking medical license. Then, do a consultation with a lawyer. Some will work on the condition of getting a cut of the judgement.

I am so sorry you went through this."
14609,"You are entitled to get a copy of your medical records when you request them in writing. 
http://journal.ahima.org/2012/03/01/how-to-request-your-medical-records/

I would suggest sending your request certified mail."
14610,get a lawyer and sue that doctor for malpractice. i don't care if she refused to give you the results. she had no right to withhold the results from you and it's pretty clear that she's malpracticing entirely in your case.
14611,"I am so sorry.  You should definitely find a new doctor and I would be filing a complaint with your state's medical board.

I had a cervical biopsy once - it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  They tell you it's no big deal but it is extremely painful.  *hugs*"
14612,"My blood is boiling reading this. Hope you find a good doctor and hope you die the old, disgusting one until they have to close their doors forever. "
14613,"Woah! Bedside manner fail! Gifts say both you and another poster in here have mentioned the biopsy being rough- I'm a bit wary now!

Might be different in the uk, but I had my pap, received results in the mail 2 weeks later. It was a simple ""positive for hpv"" and stressed its not cancer, but can lead to it and I'll need a check up and MAYBE a biopsy. Came with a faq for how contracted etc as I thought it was an std! (Never heard of hpv until the vaccine was around in 2009 ish) I was baffled due to faithful partnership but it's all just a cover for bacteria

Either way next week some nurse will be having I gawp. I don't mind them looking but if there's any mention of ""pinch"" or ""sharp scratch"" I'll be unimpressed as its always highly underestimated

Annoyingly my letter is super vague about aftercare as they hint I'll need the day off work but procedure is only 15 mins- I get the joy of working from home instead....

"
14614,"Jeebus. 

I had an abnormal pap, and my mom had cervical cancer, so I was a little freaked out. But it just said ""abnormal cells"" and nothing more specific than that (sign up for Labcorp Beacon; any tests run through them will be sent to you the same time they're sent to the doctors; also get the ""patient portal"" at your doctor offices if they offer it) and so I waited a year (perhaps stupidly) because my mother had told me that it took 2 doctors and 3 nurses and a LOT of valium to pin her down and do that to her, and she told me how horribly painful it was. After that year I got swabbed again. Normal! So, I got the vaccine. 

Anyway, sign up for any service for whomever your insurance's lab-test provider is ASAPishly, and look for a progressive doctor if you can. My first GYN in college was the opposite of yours, she was trying to convince me that I needed an IUD and told me she thinks it's absurd they can't give them to teenagers in High School to prevent underage pregnancy. 

I also have a nuvaring, which I have liked FAR more than the pill (so many side effects for me), and I set a reminder in my phone calendar for it every 3 weeks (I don't take weeks off/have periods, PCOS, complicated) and that helps keep me from screwing up. 

Final thought - this is what I had to tell my sister too: 

Your doctor is your *employee*, not your boss. You are paying them to help you and to do so courteously. If they do not, inform them that you *will* take your business elsewhere, and if they still do not, then leave. 

You deserve better."
14615,"Gonna second what another commenter has already said here; set up a GoFundMe page or something. I'm a man, and this is one of the most absolutely horrifying things I've ever read happening to a woman. This doctor is a menace and a criminal, and money should not be the barrier keeping you from justice, or from getting the help you need."
14616,"Reading this made me feel sick to my stomach. I'm sorry for all the pain you are dealing with. I hope your next doctor realizes she's there to help you be healthy, not push an agenda."
14617,"First off, I'm so sorry you've been through this. I hope you find the support and legal help you need and deserve.
This is my nightmare.
1. Being [hopefully] falsely diagnosed with something serious and put through that stress. 
2. Being denied/judged when you ask for permanent prevention.
3. Being put through major pain and a procedure that has left you [hopefully not] permanently scarred and in pain, unable to be intimate with your SO. 

Unfortunately, I'm just a 22 year old girl with very little experience in this world and can offer you zero legal advice. 
But as someone who's been without insurance and paying for my own health care since age 16, I can tell you, if you haven't already tried, to go to Planned Parenthood. 
Now that they've lost federal funding, I honestly don't know what's going to change for patients like me without insurance, but I can say that they've never pressured me any one way. They've only been honest, upfront about costs, considerate, and caring. I go to a very busy location, and my doctor still recognized me and called me into her office (though I didn't need to see her for that visit) simply to check on me and tell me in person about test results from a prior visit (which I'd already hard via snail mail, but she still took the time out of her busy day to explain it to me, and to check a lump she had found in my breast at the exam). 

I got a pap and full exam for $70. No insurance whatsoever. And the results were back within 2 days. They called as well as sent a letter. 

I, too, am interested in permanent prevention, though I'm too scared so far, but they've always explained the options in a straight forward, matter of fact way. You'd never even know they had an opinion on it. That's with multiple people there. I think I've seen 3 doctors and 3 or 4 different nurses. 

I can also attest to your poor experience after rejecting the HPV vaccine. When I was still under my parents' insurance and getting a physical for my freshman year of high school, the doctor was absolutely pleasant. No issues, just normal questions and answers and small talk. Then she asked if I was sexually active. I wasn't even close. She looked at me like I was a victim and asked if my mom should leave the room so I could tell the truth. I again insisted I wasn't. You could tell she wasn't buying it, so then came the sales pitch. She went on and on, and me, being 15, and not understanding what was being offered, let my mom answer. Mom firmly said ""No. She's not active, she doesn't need it."" The doctor instantly switched personalities. She was rude, short, and bitchy. She finished by insisting on the vaccine a few more times, and when she was still shut down, she proceeded to tell me, ""well, if you gain a lot of weight in a short period of time, you'll be considered obese."" (I was 5'9"" and 130lbs. But it still shattered my confidence for a few years. Mission accomplished, bitch.) 
I still would love to know how many years of school it took for her to come up with that. Genius. 

So yeah, I absolutely wouldn't be surprised if it was a fucked up scare tactic. But it should ABSOLUTELY be illegal, somehow. And to not share your test results with you?!? What?! There's no way that's legal. You have to fight it. 

I wish you justice and courage. I'm so glad you seem to have a loving a supportive man by your side through this, and I really truly pray you'll be okay and it'll all work out. "
14618,"I get the trouble with breaking loyalty to the doctor you've been seeing for years; but there needs to be that conversation where you explain your goals medically to them and they agree. If they don't, you break amicably and get a new doctor. That's what's supposed to happen and it is hard to do. I can't tell you how many gynecologists I've walked away from because of differences like what you're talking about. They talk about family planning or refuse to do an annual/pap on me or refuse BC. That's the kind of appointment that I only have once. I'm not going to try to change their minds and I'm not going to go back hoping for an apology. It's my health care and if I can't make my decisions, I'm freaking gone. That simple. 

To that end, I'm sorry it took all of that to get you there, but at least you know to screen doctors now. A bit of advice, with patience you can get a lot out of what a doctor does over the phone before even scheduling the first visit. It can save time and money."
14619,"That pain thing is bunk. It just depends on the individual in question's pain tolerance. My pain tolerance is over all fairly high, so there's the disclaimer. But I've never had kids, had the IUD put in in the afternoon, took a 2 hour nap and then went for a long but fairly slow paced bike ride. I felt fine. The insertion was uncomfortable but not wildly painful. (Imagine the cramp you get right before you have to poo violently.) But it was over in a second and the rest of the day I had about the same level of cramping I would on a normal period day. It didn't slow me down any, really. I took the whole day off to rest but by the evening i was on my bike with my pals. 

I got mine put in at planned parenthood and they didn't give me any judgey grief at all. Just put that IUD right in and sent me home with a large ibproufin. "
14620,"i know someone who tested positive for hpv at a planned parenthood and was given paper results without even asking. hers were hpv, but they only detected cells, no actual growths or warts. they did a retest about 3 months later and no hpv present. most of the time, as long as something isn't super serious, they do a follow up pap. seems like this doctor was jumping the gun.

i have never been to an actual ob/gyn's office, even at my age. cost is a factor, but i feel these places compare to an expensive judgemental therapist's office who shames you instead of a counseling center for homeless people that actually cares and wants to help, kwim? seems pretentious. i know you've replied you live in what seems to be a rural area/small town, but maybe you could make the trip to a planned parenthood or the like? i love the women's clinic i go to- no hassles regarding my nontraditional birth control choice!

and yes, i do think lawyering up is needed."
14621,You should smack her in the face with a bloody baseball bat. 
14622,"Report her asap. She sounds like a sick individual, and from what you have written she has no right to be practicing right now. 

  I'd also look into therapy because this experience seems to have been traumatic. 
Keeping your records from you is illegal, BTW. Having access to them is your right. 
Here; 
http://www.realsimple.com/health/first-aid-health-basics/what-to-ask-your-doctor/how-to-complain-about-your-doctor

Don't let her get away with that. This was an unnecessary procedure me thinks, since she is going to great lengths to hide lab results. Dude, she essentially used medieval torture methods on you, in modern day, under the guise of a what was to be a SAFE  medical procedure.
I'm so angry for you right now I am shaking."
14623,"You need to write this up for the general public and see about submitting to a local paper to publish, or a blog or something. Anything to get it out there how awful and inhumane this piece of trash was to you. Send it everywhere and to everyone. People need to know about this. Mail it to some lawyers, see if you can get some help with this. This was just assault, plain and simple. 

I'm so sorry this happened to you, what this person did is absolutely unacceptable and they should not be in a position of power over anyone. You poor thing. I hope you can find a good, responsible doctor to help you! Maybe someone in this comm is (semi-)local to you and can recommend someone?"
14624,"What the fuck. I would not let any doctor cut a part of my cervix unless /I/ could feel there was something wrong, or there is other prominent evidence."
14625,"Thank you so much for sharing this. Our circumstances are almost identical- been with my husband for nearly 7 years, and my doctor would not stop going on about me getting the hpv vax and to also switch my iud (which was strange in itself) from the paraguard to the mirena needless to say she did the horrific and painful biopsy on me too when I was all of a sudden diagnosed with advanced hpv, I cried because this kind was the kind that leads to cervical cancer. I have been living a nightmare ever since. 

I showed my husband this post and he said agreed and thought the way my doctor went about everything was just a step above a door to door salesman.  I will be getting insurance again this coming year as I couldn't afford it any longer but when I do I am going to a different doctor for another opinion. Thank you again for sharing your story here. I wish you all the best. "
14626,This sounds horrifying. I'm so sorry that this happened to you.
14627,"Fun fact: medical records are considered legal documents (they hold up in court). Get ye a lawyer, something fishy is going on here. Im starting to wonder if she did an unnecessary procedure. "
14628,"Lawyer. You need a lawyer, STAT. What she did was fucking AWFUL and malpractice, if you ask me. She wasn't giving you YOUR OWN MEDICAL RECORDS?! And you should have been given a numbing agent on your cervix before the biopsy, and pain meds after. My sister had to go through that,and she had time off and pain meds. This doctor is an awful awful bitch. Sue her."
14629,"Dude she PURPOSELY DAMAGED YOUR CERVIX. That's an immediate lawsuit right there.

Start a GoFundMe account if you're worried about not being able to afford a lawyer, post this on any social media, send it to the news, but DO NOT STAY SILENT ON THIS!!! This is medically wrong and she does not deserve her ""perfect reputation."" Drag her down. We're here for you."
14630,"You should always feel comfortable with ANY doctor you see. And, you are allowed to ask for ANY medical record, (at least in the U.S.) You should always have a copy of yours. 

However, stating, ""... she started harping on the HPV vaccine. She insisted that I get it immediately, because my age put me at a high risk for cancer-causing HPV strains."" 

As a 3x cervical cancer survivor who lost half her vagina, her uterus, her hair, her ferility, her fallopian tubes, her ovaries and some of her ass and vuvla: The vaccine is your BEST BET right now. And spreading false information about it causing anything bad is frankly irresponsible. 

But what I'm most concerned about ISN'T the fact that you're trashing on the vaccine, (I understand that.) It's that you're speaking about having difficult and painful intercourse with blood during and after. If your significant other is touching near your cervix, this could be also causing the bleeding. (HPV causes lesions on the skin and when touched- they can bleed.) She should have taken your concerns SERIOUSLY and immediately given you a referral to another doctor. (Please make sure to rate her on healthgrades.) Promise me, you'll get into an OBGYN asap- you need to do the following: 

- Ask for your records. (Some states allow clinics to charge a fee. It's worth it- pay for it and take it with you.) 

- Get a referral to another OBGYN, or visit your local Planned Parenthood. Ask questions such as, ""It said I was positive for HPV. Do I have a high-risk strain? (Type 16 and 18.)"" Ask if they can find out WHAT strain you have, (a simple HPV test will do this for you and type the strain- allowing you to better understand what you're dealing with.) Remember: Most cases of cervical cancer take over 10 years to develop. Simply having HPV does NOT mean you have pre-cancer or cervical cancer. It means, your body is simply at a higher risk to develop this cancer. 

- She told you that having HPV dormant in your body won't prevent you from having children because it's true. Education is important. 

Do your due diligence. Get second (and third!) opinions. Know your rights and be assertive. But please-- also be educated. 
"
14631,"Ummm....you need to lawyer up, get checked by a real doctor, and get yourself fixed. "
14632,"I sympathize and I agree with all the other commenters here telling you that these people are assholes and that you didn't deserve any of that shit and you should probably be trying to get them all in trouble. What they did to you was medical malpractice, straight up. It sounds like they got tired of you asking for shit they didn't want to give you and decided to burn your cervix to get you to shut up about it. You should've walked out when they refused to give you the results of your pap, yes, but it's still 100% their fault what they did to you and bringing the hammer down on them will not only get you justice but prevent it from happening to anybody else.

Nonetheless, this passage perks up my SJW-sense:

>She then told me that the fact that I fidget and squirm while getting my annual exam made her think I wouldn't even be able to go through with insertion. Well, of course I squirm during my annual. Someone has their finger in my vag and I didn't really give them enthusiastic consent to be there. 

I don't like the term 'enthusiastic consent' because it ends up being a weasel word for yes not really meaning yes under a variety of circumstances, some of which are utterly impossible for your partner to figure out. Now, that's not the case here... but are you actually implying that you're not consenting to a routine medical exam involving your vagina? If this is the case, why are you getting it done?

The logic of ""Yes, I'm an adult, I'm agreeing to get this exam done, I fully understand why it has to be done in this way... but I don't *consent* to it"" is just mind-boggling. Either you're allowing somebody to put a finger in your vagina for medical purposes or not. 

Saying yes and not being happy about it doesn't imply a lack of consent in any way.  Life is full of shit we don't want to do, don't like to do, but agree to do anyway, and to hold other people responsible for that just seems to be insane."
14633,"Right now I'm trying to find another OB/GYN to at least do a follow-up pap to confirm that I do not have an active HPV infection. I just got my insurance back (I was unemployed for a while) so I'm calling around to different offices. No luck so far, but there's a long list. I know finding someone that is cool with being childfree is very slim, but I at least want one that isn't going to treat me like shit for feeling that way. Fingers crossed. I would talk to some lawyers, but I'm already prepping to file for bankruptcy so I'd rather not get into it. This doctor has a flawless reputation otherwise, I feel like I'd just lose."
14634,"> call every agency I could think of to help, and maybe even a few I just want to call to say I've called them.
> I'd still talk to a lawyer, because contingency basis is a thing, and since this is obviously abnormal and they blew you off, you likely have a good case - and you could help stop this from happening again. Check some legal aid resources in your area, as well, since this is absolutely ridiculous behavior.

Seconding this.  For the sake of everyone else in your area who is CF, PLEASE get this nut in trouble!

"
14635,If a nurse said that to me I'd call the licensing board so fast it'd make her head spin. 
14636,"Reading the original post, I kept waiting for the doctor to just say, ""You can't even handle this, what makes you think you can handle getting an IUD?"""
14637,"To be fair, until this person's medical files and reproductive organs are examined by a trained doctor who can tell if anything went amiss with the procedure, this could really have just been a run of the mill punch biopsy that many women have dealt with due to concerns over cervical cancer. Nothing may have been done incorrectly at all. 

She may also be dealing with a totally separate issue that's causing her to bleed during sex. She needs a trained doctor to help her, not reddit's input on her negative description of a medical procedure.

They actually have to put you under for the conical version of a cervical biopsy due to how painful it would be if you were awake. Biopsies are no joke, they can really hurt. But they are absolutely necessary when a competent doctor indicates that they should be done. 

This is why the HPV vaccine is so important. All it takes is one partner one time with an active HPV infection of the cancer causing kind and you may eventually need a cervical biopsy that could impact your ability to be active and have sex for weeks. And if you avoid the biopsy, you could wind up fighting cervical cancer. 


A biopsy necessarily requires that some of your tissue be taken, that's the realty of the procedure in any case that calls for a biopsy of any organ. Why are you acting shocked at that reality?


OP would need a medical professional to review her original test results and her current physical status to determine if anything in this procedure was done *incorrectly* or if the procedure itself was not necessary based on her original test results. Otherwise, it sounds like fairly standard practice.


The only part that is extremely fishy to me is the refusal to share the test results that spurred the biopsy. Everything else she has suffered could be coincidental and due to a lack of professional decorum in that office. OP absolutely must see a different specialist to figure out why she is bleeding during sex and to get her recurrent yeast infections treated. She can't just blame the biopsy for these things with no evidence. 


For all any of us know, she's bleeding during sex because she actually *does* have cervical cancer and the doctor actually screwed up not by doing the biopsy but by *not* sending the biopsy sample out for testing (I do not actually think this is likely, but do you see my point?). The top cause of bleeding after sex is actually cervical cancer, not a biopsy you had half a year ago! OP needs follow up testing as soon as possible.


OP herself admits choosing not to get vaccinated against the cancer causing strains because her friend claims she reacted to the vaccine. Due to that choice, she needs to be extra vigilant in seeking medical care when abnormalities occur with her reproductive system because she is not protected from the most cancerous strains. 


Instead, though, she is on reddit demonizing a doctor over a painful procedure and complaining about bleeding that she has not sought a second option on (and has not had treated for half a year after the procedure she blames!). No one in this thread should be supporting OP's viewpoint until she comes back here telling us she's seen a competent physician about her problem and has a second (or third) opinion that supports her claims of malpractice by this crappy doctor. 


OP's life may be at risk, though that's highly unlikely, and us telling her anything that isn't ""go see another doctor right now!"" is a disservice to her health. Telling her that ""ripping"" tissue off her cervix is a bad thing when that's literally what a life saving biopsy does is just silly. If she, in fact, did need the biopsy then that just is what it is. "
14638,"By the by, if you are still able to get an IUD but scared because of what's occurred, I was able to have someone come with me to my procedure and I got anti-anxiety meds to take as well which made it SO much better. PM me if you have any questions about that."
14639,"Wow, I didn't have any of this kind of problem when I got my IUD.  The PP nurse inserted it without any problem and my cervix didn't have to be manually widened or whatever that means.  It was very pinchy to insert and I did have some strong cramping for the rest of the day, but that was about it.  "
14640,Thank you for the links.
14641,"I will take that into consideration. Right now I just don't have the mental energy to deal with it. I felt like I really needed to vent though because none of my female friends even get their annual exams so none of them understood a word of what I was saying. They just look at me in shock for a moment and then go ""so anyways about that nail polish I was going to buy.."""
14642,"When I tried my first 2 Mirena insertions, it hurt like fuck, but the midwife had never inserted it into a woman w/o kids before. She was able to refer me to a gynecologist that had, though. To be sure, I also asked to me anesthetized too."
14643,"Since I was never allowed a copy of my pap results, I don't think I'd have any legal standing against her. From what I understand, she's never had a case against her and her reviews are flawless. Plus I'm getting ready to file for bankruptcy with a pro bono lawyer so I'm not gonna get involved in anything until that's taken care of. To answer your question about the doctor list though, unfortunately the closest one is about a 2 hour drive from me. I'm going to contact her anyways if she takes my insurance though. My fiance told me he'd drive halfway across the country for me if it meant I could get fixed and stop worrying."
14644,"I really, really wish I could. But I have no concrete proof of anything. I didn't record anything, didn't write anything down. My fiance wouldn't be a proper witness because of bias and the fact that he was only there for the actual procedure. Now that I've called a few times, they've agreed to take a look at the biopsy site if I come in for another pap. It's worth mentioning the joke about that being my permanent birth control was not meant to be said directly to me. I think she had put the phone down to check on something and had said it to another nurse because it was muffled/far away. I'm honestly hoping I just heard it wrong because I don't want to believe anyone in the medical community would treat someone in such a way."
14645,"My only problem with this explanation is that I had no dysplasia. At no time did they see any evidence of dysplasia. I started showing symptoms of a yeast infection the day after the pap was done (I'm prone to them) and assumed that could have caused the abnormal result. The doctor said she didn't see any yeast during the exam so that's impossible. Well my underwear smelled like fresh baked biscuits so I'm pretty sure it was possible. But I felt the biopsy was done when there was no need for it. Wait and see would have been just fine. Also sensitivity is one thing. A blood bath riddled with what I assume is scar tissue is a whole different thing. And I have not had success with any birth control, really. I get so much breakthrough bleeding it's like I'm on my period more often than I'm not. Nuvaring is okay but I do get some really nasty breakthrough bleeding and have ruined countless pairs of undies."
14646,"I feel the letter would fall on deaf ears (blind eyes??) if it even got read as a whole. As for the HPV thing, from my understanding, the infection could be dormant by now and a negative test now wouldn't prove anything. I guess they can't test for it if it's not in active infection? I don't know much about it and everything they said was confusing."
14647,I'm not sure I can prove that it was because of my refusal to have children or my refusal to get the HPV vaccine. That's kinda hard to prove without a confession.
14648,"My mom had one and she said it wasn't bad. Though she has had a child... obviously. But reading some posts online, most women aren't in awful pain like I was told I would be."
14649,"Her excuse about not pausing is that the procedure is quick and everything needed to be done quickly. Especially throwing the iodine solution in there. ""You could bleed out"" well ma'am, if I could bleed out from that, I'm not sure this procedure is 100% safe."
14650,"Unfortunately, I am VERY far away from that area. My insurance now is much more restrictive and there's only about 5 doctors within reasonable driving distance that I can try out before I have to pay for almost everything out of pocket. Right now I am not in an emotional or mental state to take legal action, but I will if I feel ready to do so."
14651,Cone biopsy is a different procedure than a colposcopy (minimal biopsy). A cone biopsy is an operation that can remove a substantial portion of the cervix and is generally done under anesthesia due to the severity. A colpo is the removal of a small tissue sample. 
14652,"There are many strains of HPV. Some cause cancer, some don't. The vaccine does not protect against all strains and it does not protect against every single cancer-causing strain. If it did, I'd be all over it. Right now I feel like it's just playing darts with a blindfold on. Sure, you might hit the target. But you might also waste all of your time hitting the wall instead of the dartboard. Also, I didn't have a cone biopsy. I was not numbed in any way because it's apparently too small of a procedure to deem that necessary. Honestly, I think if I calmly explain what happened instead of being harsh, it would benefit me to have the new doctor know that I had a potentially traumatic experience with the old doctor. I haven't had any procedure or pap done since the biopsy and I don't know if there's the potential that I'll freak out and have the new doctor think I'm crazy. I'd rather her know that in advance."
14653,"For clarification: Skyla is the smaller one. And the difference is a mere 2mm in width and 4mm in height.

14654,Or if it's fraud. 
14655,It's just really sad because she wasn't like this at first and she just slowly got worse. Her nurse practitioner is nice but shares the idea that women without children should not be sterilized for any reason.
14656,"None of the doctors on the list are near me. The closest is 2 hours away. I still want to speak with her at some point though. I'm going to have the biopsy site looked at soon (hopefully) to see if ti looks botched or if I somehow sabotaged my recovery. Sometimes my mind creeps into this place where I feel like this is all my fault. Oh, and if I may ask, what brand of IUD do you have? "
14657,"If I could just get her on the unnecessary biopsy alone, I'd be happy. I don't want her doing invasive procedures on young women that are otherwise visibly healthy."
14658,"It was not only painful, but it was traumatic. When I was healed and my fiance and I tried to be intimate again, I flipped out. I wouldn't let him touch me and I started to panic. I was afraid it was going to cause me some sort of unimaginable pain."
14659,"I assume you meant sue and not die, but both sound pretty brutal. :P"
14660,"We don't have a Title X Planned Parenthood in the area, unfortunately. At least not one that's in a safe enough neighborhood to go to. The last pap I got at PP was very rough and I was rushed out of the office because they had limited hours. And I'm not in a small town, actually, I'm close to my state's capitol. We just don't have doctors here that are friendly with childfree patients, it seems."
14661,"The Pap smear showing cancerous cells is the ""something wrong."" People thinking they know better than doctors contributes to a lot of cancer death in this country. You can't see your own cervix microscopically ffs "
14662,"I'm not going to give that argument the time of day because it doesn't belong here. Out of all those things I posted, you decided you wanted to evaluate how I may be some crazy SJW? Fuck outta here with that. I'm saying nobody enjoys having an annual done so we're not jumping for joy at the thought of a finger being in there when we really don't want it there but it HAS to be done. "
14663,"I'd still see about talking to someone from a legal aid organization anyway, they may have insights you don't that could help you out regardless! :)

And reputation isn't everything - obviously something went wrong.  They mocked you.  They can go choke on a barbed wire sex toy for all I care, but they need to stop practicing any kind of medicine if this is how they treat people who have different ideas for their own lives."
14664,"> This doctor has a flawless reputation otherwise, I feel like I'd just lose.

Reputation vs. Proof. Proof is all that is required. Also, the reality is that her malpractice insurance company would likely move to try and settle to avoid the cost of litigation. Remember that hiring lawyers is not cheap for them. Just do get proper advice if you do get offered a settlement so that you don't settle for a lowball offer or something."
14665,They might only have a flawless reputation because everyone is too intimidated to complain.
14666,You should just go to anyone about the effects from the biopsy. Believe it or not the biopsy she did can affect your fertility. Of it is open still that is a huge infection risk and needs to be treated asap. For the future though you'll want to find someone you like. 
14667,do you have a planned parenthood in your area? that would be my first suggestion. they have a sliding fee scale too. go get yourself taken care of first. have them take a look at what has been done to you. get a copy of your report if possible. 
14668,"When you are having serious issues with the level of care in a hospital (U.S.), here is the route you can take to fire your doctor/nurse, get moved to a different room/unit, etc.; clinical supervisor/charge nurse, then patient advocate, then lawyer.

Most people have no idea of their rights when in medical care. Some people irrationally try and fight staff, which can lead to psychiatric incarceration, or immediate felony charges, and 4 point restraint with a spit bag on the head. Some leave A.M.A (against medical advice), this means insurance will not cover the bill.

The patient advocate exists, only to rectify serious issues with patient care. It sounds like you are having one. Try and contact the patient advocate at your hospital. It sounds like a good option, as you do not want to lawyer up."
14669,"Is there a PLanned PArenthood in your area? They tend to be amazing with stuff. (My sis had an HPV scare and abnormal cells, they took amazing care of her.)"
14670,"I tried getting an IUD twice, but the pain was too much. Which is why I had them knock me out the third time. :-) Yes, it is more expensive, but I got the damn thing in there and don't have to worry for another 4 years. Considering what poor OP went through, though, this probably won't be an option for her. :-("
14671,"Well, my doctor said the entrance to my cervix was smaller than normal, or something like that, so that's why. I don't really know much about it because I was so nervous that everything sort of blurred together. I am a big pansy when it comes to pain (the only exception being tattoos)."
14672,"My first pap smear (at the age of consent in my area) met the legal definition of sexual assault. I was screaming no, begging, pleading; my father heard me from the waiting room but he couldn't get in. I never took action because I didn't know I COULD (it didn't help that the doctor who did this to me was my soon-to-be-ex-stepmother's friend so I would've had no support if I had tried to take action). It's been ten years and I can't even look at the tools without having PTSD flashbacks. I can understand how extremely traumatizing this can be and I'm sorry that your friends are so dismissive. "
14673,"Aww.....well hugs from me, anyway. 

"
14674,Check your insurance account. Doctors send samples out to other companies for testing. See if another company like Quest Diagnostics billed your insurance and call them directly. You are allowed to see your own medical information. 
14675,"> Since I was never allowed a copy of my pap results,

Here's the thing. The lawyers can subpoena that shit. And she can't fucking refuse that. The fact that you don't have copies doesn't matter. The legal folks can make that happen.

You just want to make sure that you don't miss the statute of limitations to file. Typically, you can only wait a specific maximum time to file things depending on what the law is for a specific type of thing. You don't want to miss the opportunity just due to a timing issue. 


"
14676,I'm pretty sure in the US they are required to release your medical records to you or your new doctor as a matter of federal law. They are allowed to charge you absurd but specified fees for photocopying pages. A quick search will turn up the relevant info.

Please, please take action against her. And go and see another health care professional. I understand if you were too emotionally hurt from your experience but if you are able to go after her. "
14679,Isn't the fact that you don't have your medical records and your were given a procedure without all available information proof enough? They can subpoena your records too. That may provide more evidence. 
14680,DO NOT GO BACK TO THAT LADY!!!!!!
14681,"I also had a completely normal pap, but tested positive for a high risk strain of HPV. My doctor only recently started being able to test for the specific strain.  

Because of the high risk strain, I went through a colposcopy, which looked rather normal from the doctor's eyes, but the biopsy came back very, very abnormal, thus requiring me to have a LEEP.  

I am extremely grateful for this technology and they were able to excise all abnormal cells from the LEEP. Yes, the LEEP was unpleasant and stressful, but it (hopefully) has stopped anymore abnormal cells from returning and thus preventing cervical cancer. 

I was too old for the vaccine when it came out and already had HPV."
14682,"I was confused because you stated ""so far so good"" with the Nuvaring outside of its permanence. The Nuvaring employes etonogenestel as do implants. They're a high androgenic factor hormone that may cause acne or breakthrough bleeding. If you have not had severe or adverse reactions to this in the form of the Nuvaring, that's probably why your doctor recommended the implant (lower microgram dose over time) versus the IUD. Hormonal IUDs also cause breakthrough bleeding. Sometimes its stops, sometimes it doesn't. 

Did the doctor take a culture for yeast? It's not something they will see, but rather test for. Same for BV, trich, etc. Should be done every so often in younger women. Same thing with the tests. Again, she didn't explain this at all - but they can look at the cervix (washed with acetic acid or dye) during the exam and give a tentative ""all clear"" but find something different in the labs. There are so many strains of HPV you're not going to get a detailed pathology report on exactly what you had unless it's one of the strains that's high risk and even in that case, you're getting a report on the severity. Technology is pretty amazing these days as another commenter pointed out, but it's also costly to run unnecessary tests.

Any time you have an internal procedure there is absolutely risk of infection or the procedure site to reopen or bleed. The Monsel's solution will usually cause discharge for 5-7 days that looks like old coffee grounds mixed with some blood. It sounds like the doctor did not apply the Monsel's in a thorough manner. Did the doctor also explain no tampons, no fingers, no nada up there for 7-14 days after the procedure? 

I'm concerned out of this post that you feel the vaccine is a scare tactic from one doctor or some kind of weird retribution for being childfree. It's not. Anyone here that's gone through more invasive procedures will tell you damn well it's not. Anyone here that has had a partial hysto in their 30s and removal of the cervix will tell you its not. It's a jab in the arm that will likely make you a little woozy and sore at the injection site. 

Your doctor didn't give you informed consent about what was done. I hope that you find a doctor that DOES explain these things and treats your concerns seriously. I really also hope you reconsider the vaccine and don't buy into false propaganda or a bad experience with one doctor. "
14683,They'd still have the actual test results they took which could be gotten easily in discovery. If the test results magically disappeared that would look mighty shady. 
14684,"Its unfortunate that you've already made up your mind to allow this ""doctor"" to get away with her malpractice and your now, most likey permanent, botched proceedure. You should put your body above your embarrassment over the situation, you only get one, and this ""doctor"" will be able to do this to how many other young women. You are in a position of power in this situation. The ""doctor"" and her staff have issues. I work for a surgeon and your story enrages me, and your lack anger sadens me."
14685,I had a whole ordeal where my uterus rejected the first one so I had to have a second one inserted using an ultrasound machine for perfect placement. I definitely recommend asking for this in the first place.
14686,I'm sorry :( I hope things get better soon. I wish I could help you.
14687,"This is like saying you shouldn't get the  measles vaccine because it doesn't project against smallpox. It's illogical. 

Your negativity about this vaccine is uneducated and misinformed. Please stop spreading misinformation about something that is actively saving lives. 

When you have some actual data, then please present them. Otherwise, make your personal choice and don't spread this kind of odd thought process around to others who might mistakenly think you actually know what you're talking about."
14688,"To reiterate what others have said, I understand if you choose not to have the HPV vaccine, but please realize that the reasons that you state are factually incorrect. Try to clear your mind of what you have heard, and talk to a medical professional about the vaccine and ask questions to clarify any concerns that you have. Then, weigh the actual facts to make a decision. Until you talk to a medical professional, I encourage you not to continue commenting on the vaccine so as to not spread misinformation. "
14689,"Ah yeah, it is Skyla. But 2mm being pushed through your cervix I'm sure makes a difference, considering it is painful to begin with. I'm glad I went with the minimal size option, even if the difference is small.

Edit: phrasing"
14690,This was not your fault!!!!!!!!!!! You have every right under the sun to make your own decisions for your own life. That lady is a bully and she manipulated you. 
14691,"Hey, two hours isn't that bad. It's too far for a regular doctor, but it's still a good option for someone that will sterilize you :) Hopefully you can have your cervix looked at soon. *fingers crossed*This is in no way your fault, even if you did some how sabotage your recovery, it would still be the doctors fault for not telling you. She can't expect you to be clairvoyant!I have a Skyla, feel free to ask me anything you want about it!"
14692,"So, the best thing for you to do right now would be to contact a legal expert regarding medical malpractice. This physician has failed to meet their ethical and legal obligations for patient care and may even be engaging in fraud -- especially if she's billing for procedured that are medically unnecessary.


You should not be bargaining down your position before you've even taken steps to defend your rights and the rights of other patients. You should contact an attorney and provide a detailed and honest account of what has occurred. The attorney can then determine which rules and laws the doctor may habe violated, file suit, and initiate discovery to recover records and other evidence of wrong doing. 

No one on reddit will be able to take those steps.

Please talk to an attorney."
14693,the biopsy alone is malpractice. talk with a lawyer i'm pretty sure any would take your case based on what she's done.
14694,I understand that.  I don't want my comments to be misconstrued as unsympathetic to what you've been through.  It sounds nightmarish from start to present.  
14695,"So when you flipped out with your fiancé, you weren't actually IN PAIN, you just *feared* that you *might be*?"
14696,"My phone hates me sometimes. Yes, sue. "
14697,are there any abortion clinics? reason i ask is because many clinics where i live offer women's health as well as abortion. usually such places have better options.
14698,"Out of all those things I posted, you want to ignore the first paragraph of my passage?  I agree with every other top-level comment here, 100%. There's just no reason for me to repost what everybody else is saying.

Yes, what was done to you was wrong. Yes, you have every right to think your doctor is a quack. Yes, you should be seeking legal recourse.

Does it make you happier if everybody just parrots the same shit at you, their own opinions or observations be damned? Would you rather live in an echo chamber where everybody tells you your shit don't stink?"
14699,"I do agree, but it's weird to think that I might be the only one that has been treated this way. Considering the neighborhood and the clients she serves, I was probably the only one that has ever dug my heels in about my medical choices. I don't think that sat well with her."
14700,What would constitute as proof? I'm just afraid I don't have any that would hold up.
14701,"Plus there is a lot of time lost that could be spent treating patients by handling the litigation.

Plus there is a hit to the reputation for even being sued in the first place, never mind losing a case. "
14702,"My first pap smear was at 15 years old, so I shouldn't have even NEEDED a pap smear for the birth control I wanted to start taking again(especially considering the last time they prescribed it to me all I did was a pee test for pregnancy). 

The doctor told me I couldn't get the birth control without it and I was missing 2 days of school a month, so me and my mom decided that I'd go through with it.

My mom was IN THE ROOM when it happened, the doctor didn't even tell me when she was starting or what was going on and it fucking hurt worse than anything I'd ever been through, and so I was crying and begging the lady to stop, but she didn't and my mom didn't stop her and didn't bring it up again until 4 years later when I brought it up while she and my grandmother(her mom) were in the room. My mom snidely commented to my grandmother that she  had ""told you I ruined her"". Like really? You couldn't have talked to ME about it since then?

But yes. It IS extremely traumatizing. I can't even put in a tampon without breaking down. I don't know if trying anything down there hurts now because anxiety, or something like vaginismus, or that lady somehow fucking broke me. Because I don't think the pap should've hurt THAT much."
14703,"That is awful. That is just fucking awful. I'm so sorry you had to go through with that. Most of my female friends come from families that believe anything inside your underwear is ""icky"" and so they just don't allow them to get proper care. Now that they're adults, they don't even know you're supposed to get exams because they never got them."
14704,Will they still be able to give me that information if I no longer have the insurance? It was canceled 2 months ago due to job loss.
14705,I will look into when I have the emotional and mental energy to do so. Tonight is just not a night I feel strong enough to do the research. But thank you for informing me about the statute of limitations. I had completely forgotten those exist.
14706,I think what I'll do is have the records sent to a new doctor and then ask them for a copy. But I'd like to have a 1 on 1 discussion with another OB/GYN to go over the issues I'm having with the biopsy site and see if my story of the procedure gives off any red flags for malpractice with the new doctor.
14707,"I figured, but again I was in total shock at the time. Otherwise I would have thrown a hissy fit."
14708,I will try to go after her but the only support system I really have in my fiance. My family (whom we live with due to financial reasons) believes that taking legal action is just being completely overdramatic. Going into it with little support will be hard.
14709,"I'm afraid that if they supoena the records and it comes up that I did test positive for HPV and had some sort of abnormality, I'd have no case beyond that."
14710,"It's very difficult to pursue a med mal case.  Most cases just don't have enough in damages for an attorney to take it on a contingency fee basis.

Because OP is still alive and presumably will heal and have no permanent issues from the biopsy, it's very unlikely there's a med mal suit here that any attorney would consider worth litigating.

(I only post this because I see this suggestion a lot and people do not understand how unlikely it is to even find an attorney to litigate a med mal case, never mind to actually win.)"
14711,Not planning to.
14712,Same experience in every way. After 7 years I'm clear. I'm not sure why everyone's freaking the fuck out--this seems typical of gynecology.
14713,"There's also not a lot of information given outside of the fact that you're at ""stage X"" with a high risk strain of HPV. I had the LEEP performed after a series of 3 colposcopies over 3 years. There wasn't a lot of affirmation from the doctors outside of ""we'll wait and see before performing a more invasive procedure."" 1 out of 3 of those colposcopies was a nightmare - lot of pain, passed out. The doctor that did it had a bad touch - kind of like the phlebotomist that can't find a vein very well. I had a more seasoned doctor for the other 2, as well as the LEEP, and the difference in communication and technique was night and day.

Some doctors have a shit bedside manner or are dismissive. I don't see that anything unnecessary was performed here, but clearly this doctor needs some training on communication skills."
14714,Yeah that would be pretty shady.
14715,If the doctor didnt have it the lab the test was sent out to would.
14716,"I didn't even know that was possible. The ultrasound part, not the rejection part."
14717,Ultrasound placement?! I never knew this was a thing!!! I've rejected two and needed to get Nexplanon as a result but I'd much prefer the IUD if only my uterus would keep them in.
14718,Oh absolutely! Plus some women just naturally have a smaller cervix. I have heard stories from women who said they could not get one all because their cervix was just too small. 
14719,"Eh, tell that to my anxiety. Man I really need to be medicated for that."
14720,"Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I'm going to contact her soon. See, I wanted the Skyla! But the doctor said they only deal with Mirena and would not order anything else in for me. She said that since the Skyla IUD was smaller, it was harder to insert and would end up being more painful. But... I feel like that's false information!"
14721,"Wow, what the fuck is wrong with you? It was a *joke*. Get over yourself."
14722,"I didn't ignore the first paragraph. Just because I didn't directly respond, doesn't mean I didn't read it. But having an argument about how I phrased a paragraph that was meant to be a bit of humor in a serious piece just really doesn't belong here. When did I say anything about people not being able to voice their own opinions or observations? You posted it, I responded to it. All I see is a roundabout argument that will get nowhere. So I won't humor it. It's that simple. We have different opinions and I feel neither one of us will see eye to eye here."
14723,"Seriously, fuck you. And thanks for being another shining example of how people who use the term ""SJW"" are not worth listening to. "
14724,"I still would contact some sort of legal aid - this sort of thing is wholly unacceptable.  Contact any licensing boards, etc, as well, and mention the treatment you've received.  

Sorry you got treated like scum because you have your own mind :("
14725,"Ruin. Her. Call every agency you can and tell them how horrible she has been to you. Get her fired, make her unable to work ever again--she is a BITCH who I'm convinced legitimately WANTED this to happen to you out of pure spite. She doesn't deserve the oxygen she breathes let alone her license to practice medicine. 

I hope you can find someone less psychotic who will actually take care of you. :/"
14726,"Here's a thought, you seem to be reluctant to say anything.  Others could be the same way.  After one person complains, others usually follow because now they have the support of knowing someone else is out there."
14727,"It's possible she's browbeaten other clients; sometimes people come out of the woodwork when they hear charges like this are getting pressed, because they've also been pressured.

I filed a complaint about a nurse that got very aggressive with the OBGYN tools, and it turned out she got pulled because they asked other patients and they agreed (she kind of...shoved things into me after I requested a smaller size).

If you know anyone else who goes to her, you might want to ask them (like a friend or something, obviously don't feel pressured to talk to strangers)."
14728,"Well to start with, it will likely be your new exam. They can document the damage you are experiencing and potentially determine if the procedure was done according to accepted practice or not, and beyond that, whether or not the test results indicated a true need for the procedure.

Unnecessary procedures can be considered malpractice in themselves based on ""first do no harm"" approach. Also, the other thing to remember is that if she billed you/insurance for the procedure and it was unwarranted... that is fraud or insurance fraud. And generally quite illegal. 

So even if the procedure could not be proven to be incorrect somehow, it still could be possible to pursue a fraud case. 

But anyway, this is purely conjecture by laypeople.... so you would need to consult an actual lawyer. They'll know the angles."
14729,Find a new Dr
14730,Go to a new doctor ASAP.
14731,I'm so sorry that happened to you! Vaginismus can totally happen due to trauma. The treatment for it is basically putting small things in your vagina and working up to bigger things as the small things become more comfortable. My (soon to be ex) stepmother was also in the room when I was being tortured. She also didn't stop the doctor. My dad's tried to justify it since and so I don't talk to them about it. Sometimes people are just awful.
14732,"Please talk to someone (professional) about this. I know it must be difficult to trust someone after what occurred, but please talk to someone - even if it's a therapist or some such. You deserve to be on better terms with your vagina, and there's definitely a possibility it could be improved. "
14733,"Thanks. I feel sorry for your friends that they were raised to think their bodies are icky. I mean, most doctors do paps more often than the current recommendations (every three years until age 40, I think, if you've not had any abnormal paps) and manual exams have been found to be medically unnecessary in asymptomatic patients but doctors don't want to change what they've been doing but I digress."
14734,The company might still have the record. You just just need the EOB to figure out what company did the testing. 
14735,Why did you lose your job???? 
14736,"Totally understandable, you ultimately should do what is best for you. "
14737,"Definitely. Good luck with everything, it's an insane situation."
14738,Your well-being is your number one priority. If going after her is far too emotionally draining than stop. I'm so sorry this happened to you. 
14739,The fact that they won't release your own records is a huge problem regardless of what's on them. You have a right to your health records so that you can make informed decisions about procedures. 
14740,"You don't know if you even DID test positive for HPV.  Have you really never had an HPV test before?  When I first saw my OBGYN I was tested, it's usually one of the first things they do AFAIK.  I've seen multiple OBGYNs and I always get bloodwork requests for STDs the first time I go in."
14741,">presumably will heal

We don't know that yet. The issues could be permanent or at least require extensive intervention to heal. Loss of ability to have sex ever again is pretty significant damage. "
14742,"Mine was also placed with ultrasound! Yes, it does hurt, but it's only for a day. I'd compare it to the worst period cramps you can imagine. 

It's not oh-gods-I-wanna-die pain, but you'll take the day off work for sure, if only to have a heating pad and Netflix."
14743,I must have a rockinʻ OB/GYN. Totally a thing. Do it!
14744,"Meh, I was a little crampy for an hour afterwards and then I had some hot tea and watched Netflix.I was my doctors first Skyla! She mentioned that she liked the inserter better because it had measurements on both sides.I don't know how a smaller IUD could be more painful, but I haven't tried the Mirena yet, so I can't be certain. My only side effects were: sore breasts for about 3 weeks, cramping during PMS ( not bad at all ), lighter periods, and the inability to use a menstrual cup with it. Seriously don't do that, my cup started to suck the Skyla out!Over all, I would defiantly recommended it!"
14745,"And not only did I not take it as one, I didn't recognize it as one.

Sorry for not picking up on your obviously universal sense of humor over a communications medium that removes the nuance of vocal inflection."
14746,"I can't say how I see it was meant to be humorous. To me, it honestly sounded like you were blaming your doctor for discomfort during routine examinations, which is wholly unreasonable (meanwhile blaming your doctor during all of the insane shit is 100% reasonable.) That's all.

It's sort of like middle-aged men and prostate exams. They might not like to do it but none of them are gonna say there was a lack of consent."
14747,"I guess ""listen and believe"" only applies to a woman when she's saying something you're already predisposed to agreeing with."
14748,"Legal Aid is actually helping me with my bankruptcy right now, but I'll ask my intake rep about this case. But yes, god forbid I wouldn't be a mindless sheep."
14749,"Have your new Dr. ask for your records to be transferred. Then get a copy of them. The new Doc should be absolutely appalled by this whole thing and help you out here. A Dr reporting a fellow Dr for malpractice does NOT look good at all.
"
14750,"Yeah, she didn't seem too big on the ""first do no harm"" approach. I asked if I could wait it out, and she said that was dangerous. She claimed that a lot of women have this procedure done because abnormal pap results are more common than people think. I don't think it should be common practice to snip off pieces of the cervix!"
14751,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but what is an EOB?"
14752,Not sure. I live in an at-will state. No reason specified.
14753,Thank you. I feel like a lot of people don't understand how stressful it is to battle anxiety/depression in situations like this and then have the added stress of legal battles.
14754,"Yeah, I'm getting through a lot of tough things right now. I just wanted my story out there so I could get it off my chest to people who understand and let it be a warning to those who aren't aware that this can happen."
14755,This is true.  /u/RelentlessReckless you are entitled to a copy of your medical records upon demand.  Walk in and tell them you aren't leaving without a complete copy.
14756,I really should study up on medical laws. I had no idea I was allowed to see my own medical record. Doctors have been telling me for years that I don't need to see them at all.
14757,"Considering I've gone 5 months without being able to have sex (and when I try it's just a bloody, painful mess) I would assume that's significant damage. For a society that presses on women to breed, having an inability to do so naturally would probably be a huge issue. I probably will not try to sue for personal reasons, but nonetheless I have no proof right now that this will heal."
14758,"IF that comes to pass, then yes, I'd agree with you.  "
14759,"I will see how much sterilization costs and if I'm unable to finance it, I'll probably opt for Skyla in the meantime. Though I'm a little weary because the Nuvaring actually caused my breasts to go up an entire cup size (they look so nice now) and I wanted to stay on that just in case they decide to deflate if I stop using it. Yeah, I'm a bit selfish. Also I'm healing nipple piercings so sore breasts would be really bad. They already hurt! But it sounds really nice, I'll look into it more. Thanks for the info!"
14760,Uh....I picked it up as a joke. ..
14761,"I didn't really mean it to sound like ""she was RAPING me and I said STOP but she DIDN'T!!!11!!1!!!11!!!!"" it was more of a ""okay yeah I guess you can put that finger in there but um, wow that didn't feel great can you... can you not do that? No, it's required? Oh, well okay just can you OW please don't touch that"". When I said enthusiastic consent, I was imagining someone going ""oh yes please crank me open and put your finger through my cervix!"" and that's... that's really not how it goes. It's more of a ""I just have to get through this because if I don't she won't give me a script for birth control""."
14762,Troll harder.
14763,"Oh, do fuck off."
14764,"You seriously need to talk to a lawyer about this. The 'We wont release your pap results"" is a very serious violation of HIPPA laws. If you actually told her ""Get out of me, i dont want the biopsy"" that is medical assault, she will lose her license. You need to get in contact with a lawyer. Or PM me, with your area you live in, i will find one that will help you with this.

If she did this to you, how many others has she done this to. Get a lawyer."
14765,"There has got to be someone you can call (a medical board) if for no reason other than their refusal to explain your pap. It could be that they were milking your insurance and put you through a procedure that you didn't actually need. 

I feel the Dr. - Patient relationship was abused in this case, and rather than doing what was best for the patient, the Dr took it upon herself to inject her morals into the situation."
14766,"If she's in the USA, she may not be able to get her medical records from this quack from another doctor. She would have to somehow get her medical records from the original doctor. Which sounds impossible without court order at this rate...

I've been denied access to records from an old doctor that were sent to a new doctor, or a specialist of a different type. I was told it was against HIPAA rules."
14767,"A biopsy can be important **if something is abnormal**. There is no reason to take healthy tissue if everything is normal. Since she could find nothing wrong, there is no reason she should have gone after your cervix for a biopsy.

It sounds like she's trying to keep business flowing by keeping you on non permanent and short acting solutions and is doing unnecessary work on you to suck up insurance money! She's not a doctor, she's a bitch!"
14768,"Your explanation of benefits. Basically anytime someone bills your insurance for services they provided for you, your insurance company sends you a copy for your own records so you can keep track if you want to. I'm just saying it's an easy way to find out what lab the doctor used. You could also call the office and ask what lab they use anonymously. If they ask why then say you have strange charges on your insurance and you're looking into it. "
14769,"Okay, I was just wondering if it related to the trauma you had experienced. "
14770,"I consider it a successful day if I brush my teeth before bed, so... I got ya. Dealing with anything out of the ordinary can be really difficult sometimes."
14771,"I will say, though, don't act all upset if you wait past the statute of limitations and can no longer get justice for this awful act. "
14772,Well thanks for being brave and sharing your sorry. Sorry I commented a bunch on here. It just blows me away how someone so callous is able to practice. 
14773,"And I only hope if you do decide to go after the doctor, you win, only to prevent her doing this to other people. Or at least someday leave a review to warn others.  I know the stress for you must be awful. Glad you have here to vent."
14774,I'm totally looking forward to the judgmental stares of the soccer moms with 6 kids that are in the waiting room.
14775,"As an almost lawyer taking health law classes this semester, this makes me so so sad.

I don't see how these doctors could be practicing informed consent at all (but that's just a student's opinion, bear in mind. Definitely not giving any actual legal advice.) I've always been told I had the right to my medical records. Most are available online now, in fact. 

Mind if I ask my professor about a hypothetical patient not being given access to their medical records? We've been discussing informed consent all semester in various capacities. 

And seriously, legal clinic ahoy! "
14776,"You are indeed entitled to copies of all your medical records/copies of x-rays/etc. Tell them you want complete copies, including doctors and nurses notes."
14777,http://cyrss.com/docs/hipaa/StateHIP/oh.pdf
14778,No problem! Do whatever method works for you! :) 
14779,"I feel like everyone aside from this person that read your post understood exactly what you were saying. Enthusiastic consent meaning, in this context, something you're happy to have inside you. Like sex with your SO. This was non enthusiastic consent as in ""I know this has to be done and I give consent for it, but I'm not happy about it because it's awkward an uncomfortable"". I honestly don't understand how this was misinterpreted to mean anything else, and you really shouldn't even have to explain yourself."
14780,"wait, getting your own records is against rules? that doesn't make any sense."
14781,"I am in the USA, just for the record."
14782,Could she not contact the lab they sent it to? The insurance she has probably could tell her the lab name and go from there.
14783,"Like, the pap smear came back abnormal but when she actually looked at the cervix, there was no dysplasia. She said she was testing the biopsy cells to make sure they weren't pre-cancerous. But if there was no dysplasia, I would assume there was no reason to test?"
14784,I will try going through the insurance company first. Thanks!
14785,"No, it wasn't. I think I know exactly what was behind it but again, at-will state. I just took it with a grain of salt and got back on my mother's insurance until I can find a job that works me more than 8 hours a week. I actually have an interview tomorrow afternoon for a great job and I'd be working at the same place and time as my fiance. Fingers crossed!"
14786,"Oh no, you're fine!"
14787,"Ask away, I'd love to hear what your professor has to say."
14788,"I mean, there is a SJW definition of enthusiastic consent that is a bit weird. But I see it as, unless you're getting consent that is not pressured/forced/bullied/etc what you're doing is probably rape. Enthusiastic consent in that sense is meaning ""yes, I want to do this"" and not ""I guess I'll do it since you won't stop asking me"". But yeah, I'm not sure why one person didn't get what I was trying to say. Oh well, it happens. Glad we came to an understanding (or at least I think we did)."
14789,"I completely agree!

I was told by the school nurse yesterday that it is illegal to share information that the nurse wrote down about an 8 year old student with her parents. How does that make sense?!

OP is asking for her own information and she can't see it?!? 

/r/legaladvice "
14790,"Getting your own records from the doctor that made those records is fine. 

However, I've had issues getting records from a prior doctor before. Dr. Evil for example. You get a new doctor, Dr. Good, and Dr Good is able to ask Dr. Evil for their records. Dr. Evil sends the records to Dr. Good, and Good can use those records to help your care.

However, I was told that the records transferred to Dr. Good from Dr. Evil aren't Good's own property, so Good cannot legally release the files.

That's the runaround I've been given from multiple doctors and hospitals before. It's infuriating!"
14791,"No the decision to do a biopsy is based on the microscopic results from the swab. If it was based on what your cervix looks like through the speculum then they wouldn't bother swabbing it at all. If you really did have an abnormal pap then the biopsy was justified, and is actually pretty common. HOWEVER, your experience with this doctor sounds completely inappropriate. You absolutely should have access to your own records and they treated you atrociously when you tried to tell them something was wrong. "
14792,"It would be very interesting to find out exactly what the insurance company was billed for. There may have been ""add-ons"" with a doctors office this terrible. And then you can get the insurance company involved in going after this doctor too."
14793,I will send positive Internet vibes your way! 
14794,"Exactly. And just to note, medical consent is entirely different from sexual consent. So I don't really understand why, in this context, anyone would think of relating it to any SJW line of thinking. 

Anyways, I also want to say that I'm so sorry you had to go through this. I read all your comments and it seems like you've got a lot of other bad stuff piled onto that as well. I hope you get things worked out and are able to get a case against this woman because this was horrifying for me to read. I went through the same thing but with a better doctor, and this is NOT the way it should have gone. Sending you lots of love <3"
14795,"That's the HIPAA ""protection"". The 8 year old would have to sign paperwork allowing the medical information to be shared with the parents by stating that ___ and ___ can have access to the information."
14796,Thank you!
14797,"Thank you. Luckily my fiance is very supportive and I honestly want to find a doctor that will allow him to accompany me into the exam room for my annuals because after this, he feels like he's really helpless just sitting in the waiting room. He doesn't want to admit it, but watching me in that much pain scared the life outta him. And not being able to do anything to stop it probably made him feel helpless and useless. He can be a real asshole sometimes, but he's been my rock through this entire situation and everything else we're facing right now."

14799,"Even if she has Down syndrome and can barely write her name?

Edit: Honestly asking and not trying to negate your statement. I really don't know. "
14800,"I'm so glad that you have him. This also brings up another good point I hadn't mentioned: It is fucking unreal to me that she wouldn't let him hold your hand. I mean, I wouldn't have thought he'd be allowed in the room with you, but since she allowed it then he should have been able to sit near you out of the way and hold your hand. That's just insane to me. I'm just so upset FOR you right now. Ugh."
14801,"I ran into other issues when I was a minor in Texas and had to sign for my own paperwork to be released. I figured my parents had to do it, but things had changed so much once HIPAA came around.

I had to authorize my parents for the HIPAA clearance first, then we both had to sign the paperwork. I signed the patient line and one of my parents would then sign the guardian line.

Edit: I don't know if things are different in other states or if things have changed since I was a minor."
14802,"I understand, and there have been issues with kids that don't understand what HIPAA does and so don't sign their parents in to be in the know.

One of the reasons HIPAA was designed was for teens to get medical help in case of STDs or in need of abortions so the parents couldn't find out and potentially throw the child out of the home or hurt them. It was also meant for medical secrecy from parents or guardians that may not be trustworthy.

It's another one of those measures that has benefits, but also has caused a lot of headaches."
14803,"They let him in because ""he deserves to know you have HPV and needs to know the details. You're also allowed to bring one person to help you out of the office."" Basically what that translated to in my head was ""he has a right to know you're a dirty, filthy disease carrier and I don't want to feel bad if you fall while trying to walk to the waiting room"". I just kept telling him not to watch. I told him to turn away, read his book, do anything but watch. Perhaps it was my mistake?"
14804,I understand. Thank you for explaining!
14805,"Yeah none of this makes any sense at all. He should have been in the waiting room for a procedure like this. When I had Essure done I also had a vasovagal response. Blood pressure dropped, I was sweating, hot then cold, nausea, all that jazz. When the procedure was done they told me to just breathe and relax and take as much time as necessary. They offered water for me and everything. Same with my colposcopy. 

What you went through is all kinds of messed up on every level. None of this sounds okay. Not one goddamn bit. This is not how doctors operate (no pun intended). YOU are paying THEM. They are supposed to make sure you're as comfortable and okay as possible, first and foremost, and that did not happen here. What happened to you was unethical and downright disgusting. I truly hope you are able to get things in order so that it bites them in the ass and never happens to anyone again."
14806,"I wouldn't have wanted him in the waiting room. He is one of the only people that knows how to calm me down when I go into an anxiety attack. Not only was I dizzy, slightly disoriented, and unable to move... I was alone except for him. The doctor left the room without making sure I was able to sit and stand on my own. She left me on my back and in pain. I was not offered water. The office does not offer water to patients unless it's medical emergency. I was not allowed to sit in the waiting room to regain my strength. There is a rule that you cannot be in the waiting room if you don't have an appointment/your appointment is over or if you're not accompanying someone with an appointment."
14807,"I see you live in the states. Check out this website [Get Tested CDC] (https://gettested.cdc.gov) You should be able to type in you zip code to find a list of clinics in your area that test you confidential and free in many cases. I typed in my small, rural hometown and got a hit of about 12 clinics. If you can't find anything there, the search results should direct you to a list of other national organizations externally from the CDC.

As far as your insurance, and GP-that's out of my wheelhouse, but certainly get over the weirdness and discuss it with him-he's surely seen all types of patients in his practice.

If there's a local chapter of a polyamory society near where you live, surely they could direct you where to go as well."
14808,County departments usually offer more if you ask for it. They're pretty affordable anyways and they accept almost every insurance. Ive had a few done at mine and a 10 panel cost me about $60 without using my onsurance. Planned Parenthood is another place to check out. Their price depends on your financial situation. I'm not sure what paperwork you have to provide though
14809,U sir are a busy man
14810,"Maybe you should just not have sex with a lot of people? I am glad you are thinking about safety, but if you can't afford it, maybe just stick to a few partners that are reliable and safe. "
14811,"Planned Parenthood is the one that told me $210.  Private labs are between $210 and $250.  Unfortunately, I did ask the county department and they don't offer *any* screening services other than HIV."
14812,Damn. That's odd. How does a county health department not think it's important to test for other STDs? u/j0hnd0 probably has the best suggestion then
14813,"[Studies have shown that more than 90% of new HPV infections, including those with high-risk types, clear or become undetectable within two years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html)

You are not a ""carrier"" of infections you've cleared. You are immune to those infections if they come around again though.

If your current partner has had an irregular Pap, you should disclose to other current partners as a courtesy so they can assess their own risk. This seems like the polite thing to do.

"
14814,"Thanks for your response. I have read that about the studies as well, but I've also read it's possible to carry it and not know it, only to have it activate many years later. Also I wonder what the logic is for not vaccinating people over 26... I thought it was because in the eyes of the insurance actuaries, it's too late for us. "
14815,"Your bodies immune system makes a catalogue of all the foreigners that try to come in and cause trouble. If that foreigner comes back and tries to raise a ruckus again, your body is prepared with the same antibodies it used to kick it out the first time.

That's how vaccines work too.

The HPV vaccine, in particular, is based on a protein found in the capsid (coating), of several types of HPV that are known to cause cancer and genital warts. You get the vaccine and your body creates antibodies to that protein. When the actual virus shows up, your body recognizes that protein and attacks so that you never get an infection.

The age range was not created by insurance companies. It was established by the makers of the vaccine. The FDA approved it, the insurance companies then use the FDA recommendations to guide them.

So why the age range? Once you've been exposed to the virus, you don't need the vaccine. You already have the antibodies. They're trying to target the demographic at highest risk. You can still get the vaccine if you want it. 

It is apparent from your opening post, that you understand that you've probably already been exposed to several types of HPV. Well, unless you're sleeping with people in their 20s, so have your partners. So there is less chance that you (and your partners), have any need of the vaccine.

Obviously, one of your partners encountered a type she didn't have antibodies for. It happens.

Even if you do get the vaccine before you have sex, there is no guarantee (with any vaccine). The current vaccine covers 9 strains out of 27 that can cause problems but those 9 strains are common and responsible for 90%+ of genital warts and HPV related cancers.

As for the virus lurking forever - maybe. But this is not different than many viruses. Can you guarantee that you no longer have any active virus from last years flu?

There is some evidence that in SOME people, the virus never reaches a level that causes the body to become seropositive. And there is SOME evidence that in some people, the virus may be knocked down to a very low level but doesn't quite go away. But this is not the norm.

No matter what evidence you've read, statistics do not bear it out that the virus often hangs around and re-emerges after years.

Genital warts re-emerge over and over after treatment sometimes but this is not the same as the virus going dormant - like herpes. Instead, it is just a matter of the virus not being ""cured"" but rather the symptoms being ""treated"".

I agree that at some age, we can assume that our partners have been exposed to the most common strains of HPV but if you KNOW that one of your partners has an active infection, it's not your place to make risk calculations for other partners. You never know if they've been exposed. 

I would worry that one of my female partners might thinking the same way you are - assuming they'd already been exposed and cleared the virus types that might cause trouble. Maybe they aren't getting Paps anymore because of it. ??? Never hurts to disclose when you know."
14816,"The vaccine is prophylactic, meaning it's very very effective if you get the vax prior to being exposed to HPV, and it has minimal protective effect once you've been exposed. Which is why it's recommended to young adolescents who haven't hit sexual maturity. It's just assumed that over 20 you will have probably be exposed to some types of HPV since it's prevalent in the population. That doesn't mean that it won't work, it's just a case of probability, where each time a sexual encounter will increase the chances getting exposed to HPV, and decrease the true effect of being a preventative vaccine. No idea about the MMR.. "
14817,"The birth cutoff date for the MMR is 1957.  This is because it's widely assumed that anyone born before that date had already been exposed to measles, mumps, and rubella, which were once considered common childhood diseases (a more recent example of that would be chickenpox) and gave natural lifetime immunity to those exposed to them.

I suspect that the cutoff for the HPV vaccine has more to do with health insurance costs than any other reason.  

It's claimed that most people have been exposed to HPV by 21, or 26 - rendering the vaccine useless against the 9 strains of virus it would otherwise cover, but depending on your individual sexual experience, I would think it's unlikely that you've been exposed to all 9 viruses.

I've seen recommendations for ANYONE to get the vaccine, including older people just entering the dating arena after years of marriage, who most likely haven't been exposed to many strains of the virus.  

It's just a gamble.  It's expensive, for one thing.... And it seems like they're saying ""sure, anyone can get it, but if you've had multiple sexual encounters, we can't guarantee it's going to help you avoid these viruses and subsequent cancer.""  "
14818,Cool. Thanks for sharing!
14819,"So I am not the only this has happened to. Recently my oldest had been seen by his doc and like every visit since he was 13. They asked if I wanted him to get the HPV shot. I told them no, that I didn't feel ok about him get this one. They were like ok and didn't bug bout it for the rest of the visit. That is until the visit before his last visit. At the second to last visit they asked if I wanted to have him get his last dose of the HPV.  I told them I didn't know he had have the first two doses, and they confirmed that he indeed had the first two doses. One when he was 13 and the second months before this visit. I told them that since he had the first two that he might as well have that last then. But the thing is, I am the parent that goes to the doc visits with my kids and never once did I yes to any of them having that shot. Especially my oldest. I told my husband about it when we got home. It took him a bit to calm me down because I was pissed off to no end. Like I told my husband, I felt they had sneaked the shot in under my nose. Full well knowing that I had said no to him having it in the first place, but yet still did it anyways. Plus they print out what had been done during the visit everytime and the print out showed the shots and when they were given. It showed the dates that the nurses had mentioned and I know full well at the visits for those dates, I had said no to that shot. Also at those points I know he hadn't had the shot because they were asking like he hadn't received it at all yet. So why would they not ask after the first dose, would you like your child to receive the second dose of the HPV? Let alone let me know they were giving him the first dose in the place? Because they wanted to have it no matter what anyways. Why? Because they have to, they are more than likely forced to give it, so optional is not so optional in this case. But that's how I am seeing atm because of this. If anything, I feel I got slapped in the face as a parent because of what they did. "
14820,"If they documented him receiving them, they were paid for administering them. This is a common practice in certain medical facilities. "
14821,"money, money, money!"
14822,That's crazy because I set up an appointment a few months after my daughter turned 3 late last year to get her shots and they said she already had them. Really confused me. 
14823,"I am the same way. I had a long talk with the doc and nurse about not being ready for him to have the shots because they were new and over the past 5 years they had changed what was in the shot multiple times, I wanted the shot to be out for a while and unchanged before I really considered it. I am very confused by this because I know I didn't authorize those shots, and I have been there with him for every visit unless he happened to be sick and his dad or grandma had to take him (and on those visits he wouldn't have gotten a shot because the doctor won't give them vaccines when they are sick). I don't know what happened but whatever happened I know that I did not ok it. I just sent an email to his doctor asking him to look into because I know the shots were never authorized by me."
14824,Oh that makes sense. I don't like that because when I told them I didn't want my son to have the shots I made it very clear that I may change my mind in the future because I knew that it was important to protect him.
14825,That's what worries me!
14826,It is so strange and frustrating!
14827,"Same. Only my oldest is 16 and I have two other teens and I still don't feel ok with this shot. For each visit, I am the parent that gets to go be it they be sick or just a check up. My husband doesn't like being in doctors offices even if he's not the one being seen. My mom, I rather she not be there, she's been too involved in mine and my families life for our own good. So for this, visit either it was a glitch I can't fix or the docs were doing some underhanded stuff. "
14828,[deleted]
14829,"trust me, the shot is preferable to living with HPV. In men it's the leading cause of oral cancers. There's no way to detect it in men at this time. 

I'm trans, so i have the 'female plumbing' and every 3-4 years my pap comes back anywhere between suspicious to outright abnormal and I get to have colposcopies.  (They're not fun, if you haven't had one)."
14830,"I love our kids doctor so I would hate to think that he would do that. He has always been super understanding when I wanted to research things before I okayed them. I am not happy, whatever has happened."
14831,"I have researched and honestly don't particularly want him to have it. But I am worried which is the lesser of 2 evils, the vaccine itself or HPV. It is a big scare and him showing real interest in girls made me worry that maybe him not receiving it was a mistake. Can I ask in your opinion why do you think there is such a push for people to get the vaccine?"
14832,"I have had one, no they aren't fun. I am sorry that you are having to deal with that. I didn't want him to have he shot when it was new. It has been out a few years now and he is 13, and starting to have an interest in girls, so I want him to have it. But his immunization record shows he hasn't, which is not the case. I am upset about this because I want him to have that protection but am unsure if they can do anything now that his shot record shows that he already had it. Hope that makes sense. Thank you for the advice!"
14833,"I know that it's apparently much more bipartisan now, but i think it's hard to deny that the anti-vaccine movement at least *started* as a firmly left-wing conspiracy theory. It was a pushback against Big Pharma, evil chemicals, and ""mainstream medicine"" -- textbook left-wing conspiracy material."
14834,"If you're interested Canada did a study:

>Understanding Vaccine Hesitancy in Canada: Results of a Consultation Study by the Canadian Immunization Research Network

http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0156118"
14835,"From another paper  [Effects of Maternal and Provider Characteristics on Up-to-Date Immunization Status of Children Aged 19 to 35 Months](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1781415/):

>We examined the effects of maternal and provider characteristics on the up-to-date immunization status of children.

>We used data from the 2003 National Immunization Survey to determine variations in children’s up-to-date status in the 4:3:1:3 immunization series.

>Low maternal educational levels and low socioeconomic status were associated with high 4:3:1:3 series completion rates. Also, completion rates were high in Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black families with low income-to-poverty ratios.

So this one confirms the idea that anti-vaxxers are more likely to be well-off and white."
14836,"The anti-vaccine movement started when vaccines started.  There has always been resistance to vaccination.

So what you're saying amounts to saying that at some time in the past, the anti-vaxxers in the USA were more a left-wing movement."
14837,">Skepticism about the health effects of vaccines on children is evenly distributed among Canadians of all demographics, with no significant patterns of gender, age, income or education, according to an unusual survey that tried to cast a sociological eye on “anti-vaxxers.”

>If anything, there is a slight bias toward highly educated people, which fits with the impression that people who refuse to vaccinate their children do not lack access to scientific information so much as reject it on various grounds.

>Mr. Maggi describes this research as “raw data,” a survey rather than a proper poll, because without a clear sense of how many anti-vaxxers there are in Canada, it is not possible to say how representative a poll would be. It took about 10,000 random calls to get 1,013 people who said they do not believe in vaccinating their children.

So this info could be biased depending on what kind of phone no's they called.  Cellphone users have different demographic characteristics than landline users.  Also a lot of people wouldn't answer a phone from an unknown number.

It's kind of surprising because smallpox is such an awful disease - very contagious and it killed and disfigured a lot of people.  But, the vaccine had a lot of side effects and risks.  

I read some things by anti-vaxxers of those days, and they sounded similar to ours, talking about natural cures and not being compelled by the government.

If you see a situation where a woman looks like she may be in distress while in the company of a man, stand nearby enough that you make yourself a physical presence, monitor the situation, and be in a position to call for help if needed.

No.  There is nothing in the circumstances of my birth that are ""unearned"" compared to the circumstances of your birth.  And your attempt to, by virtue of my genitalia, disregard the challenges I have overcome and the things that I have accomplished through my own efforts is arrogant, dismissive, narcissistic, and utterly devoid of any redeeming characteristic.

14845,"These range from just normal things everyone does anyway, to absolutely outrageous and outright misandric suggestions. But the even more outrageous thing is that this basically covers every aspect of a man's life, from his hobbies to how he spends his money to the company he keeps to how he acts at any single moment. Taken in tandem with feminist principles, this is basically saying ""women can act however they want and do whatever they want but we're going to dictate every single aspect of how men live their lives"". This is equality?"
14846,"I think we've had this list on the sub before, but I could be mistaken...

1. I mean, sure, you probably should do 50% of the housework, assuming that you both also do 50% of the professional work. -shrug- The ""or more"" is a bit... bleh, though.

2. I mean, men aren't really expected to be emotional, but all the same, 50%, as a concept, I can agree with, although mileage may vary.

3. How about we just consume cultural products we enjoy, and not based upon gender? (yea, we definitely did this before in the sub)

4. Er... o... kay...

5. How about no. My role is not to be arbiter of all things 'moral'. Besides, I could be wrong about a situation and start moralizing, like an asshole, about something I shouldn't.

6. Oh fuck off. No, if someone tells me something, I should believe them in so far as it is reasonable. I should be skeptical of everything else. Now, this might vary from person to person, but being skeptical of something, as a rule, is better than just believing all things you're told. Otherwise, TV marketing would be even MORE successful than it currently is.

7. Ok, yea. No, that's good advice.

8. I mean, I should be responsible TOO, but as a man it doesn't only fall on me - but, I am the last line of defense in the event that I don't want a kid.

9. Actually, yea. Totally, 100%, on board with this one. I mean, the HPV vaccine covers stuff that isn't just to help women avoid cervical cancer.

10. How about my partner and I agree on that instead of having it decided by an ideology?

11. I can't help but eye-roll at this one given previously discussed issues with family courts, but yea, parents should both spend time with their kids, which includes that fathers should have the opportunity to spend equal time with their kids (and perhaps not work as much so that they can't).

12. I can't help but give a deep sigh for the topic of which men are also screwed by in equal measure. Men not being at home with their kids because they're still at work, because they're the primary earner, is not somehow a better option for them. There's plenty women can do to help resolve this problem number, too.

13. This one shouldn't be gendered. If the woman ends up with structural power imbalances in her favor, its not any less of a problem than if the man does.

14. Again, something that's gendered that shouldn't be, but I agree otherwise.

15. ""Don’t be an **online** bystander in the face of sexism."" Its not my job to police the internet, and its not women's job to constantly be defended. This is sexist purely because the assumption is that women can't defend themselves on the internet. Besides, men take more of the shit on the internet, so shouldn't I be defending other men?

16. How about just be responsible with your money? No gender component necessary, and it doesn't belong in this list. Just be responsible with your money. Good advice on its own.

17. I mean, sure, but I don't understand how that's a feminist issue. Like, the implication here is that men rely on women to care for them when they're sick, but men should care for their partners when they're sick, too - and I'm sure that they do, too. Men generally don't go to their doctors as much, though, so that's something men need to address but, again, that's not a feminist problem.

18. I mean, yea. I can agree to this one. I find it unfortunate that the concept of giving people compliments is basically offensive now, because some other idiots ruined it for the rest of us by lacking class or tact, but.. yea, keep your comments to yourself.

19. Why? That's sexist. Like... literally, that's sexist.

20. I mean, look for some people you can consider to be a hero that are of the opposite sex, sure, but that doesn't mean that you *have* to. They're **your** heroes, and that makes the whole thing subjective.

21. That sounds creepy, and like you're artificially promoting people rather than doing do because they've earned it. Something about this one makes me feel weird. Like, I can't identify exactly what it is I find wrong with it, but something it wrong with it.

22. Have integrity, period. I don't understand why the gender of who you're having integrity with matters.

23. Or... recognize that you're probably both the problem. You're probably failing at something, which is why she's nagging, but she's failing at properly conveying that to you, because her method of resolving the problem is nagging you.

24. Stereotypes are often built upon some truth, but all the same, resolving some of those stereotypes isn't as easy as... I dunno... making fewer people with Nazi tattoos and shaved heads into non-racists.

25. No! How DARE you! I can never be friends with the ENEMY!!! (seriously, who avoids making friends with people because of their gender?)

26. Like... deliberately? I don't entirely see the value in that. If I end up with a female manager, or whatever, fine, but... doing so artificially seems... well, worse and also sexist.

27. Ok, yea. I mean, I'm terrible at it, so its possible that this would be one of the things that my significant other helps me to be better with whereas there's something I help her to be better with in return. I mean, relationships are supposed to be a partnership, where each help one another to be better, not just have two perfect people in a relationship together.

28. I wouldn't anyway. Granted, if my girlfriend and I were going to a particular social event, and she managed to dress like I'd like her to in the bedroom, I might say something, but otherwise what she dresses in is her business. If I'm not ok with that, then I probably shouldn't be dating her. Granted, that doesn't mean I can't offer input into stylistic choices, just like I'd want/expect of her to me.

29. Why? So I can be the one to get murdered? Tell her to get a gun, because statistically, she's more likely to get away with murdering a potential assailant than I am anyways. Besides, isn't this sexist against women, too? Why don't women walk MEN home? Men are statistically more likely to get attacked or killed, so maybe having a woman there will mean there's someone to call the cops?

30. How about no. Its not my job to make everyone into a feminist. Just like its not my job to make everyone into a Christian, or a Muslim, or whatever. I'm related to people like that, and its annoying.

31. Or consume less. I mean, I don't have a huge problem with this one, necessarily. Like, if you act a fool when you're drunk, then you should learn to better handle your alcohol, but that really isn't as gendered as they're suggesting. A better one might be, have better self control and don't use drugs or alcohol as an excuse for shitty behavior.

32. Ok, well, I'll make sure to start taking up MORE space than usual then, specifically for my BALLS. Stupid nonsense about taking up space. Uhg. Are we going to start talk to fat people about how they need to stop stuffing their fat faces so that they take up less of my room? (Mind you, I'm overweight too)

33. Ok, so I should take more time off of work, not take as much over-time, and let me significant other do all of that instead? Fuckin' wage gap nonsense needs to stop.

34. ""Get in the habit of treating your maleness as an unearned privilege"" of which women definitely have ZERO privileges in comparison. This is the problem I have with this brand of feminism. There's this complete blind view of how women have things better in some situations and complete assumption that men have it the best. No. They don't. Its asymmetric, to be sure, but one is not inherently better than the other. If you want to go down the line of 'men get more respect at work', then you also have to acknowledge that men get less respect, or even disrespect, for not being at work. This shit is not one-sided.

35. ""Self-identify as a feminist."" How about no? I don't think feminism is the end-all, be-all of gender equality, of which I believe in, and thus no, I won't identify as a feminist."

1: Even if I work more hours? Even if I'm the only income in the family? And what about different types of housework? Will the women in the household be taking on a 50% share of, say, mowing lawns or cleaning gutters?

2: ""Emotional Support Work"" or emotional labor or whatever is a useless term anyway, apart from when it's used in a context of an actual workplace expecting women to do things like talk to snotty customers more. In a relationship, it's called people have different needs, be a decent person please.

3: So, choose what media I consume based not on its quality, but on its creator's gender? Because I guess female-made ""cultural products"" can't stand on their own? This sounds like benevolent sexism.

4: No. Fuck off. It's not my responsibility to accommodate your fucking paranoia, and if it were I would have already published an article telling people to stay back fifty feet because I'm antisocial and hate all of you.

Seriously, can you imagine an article telling black people to ""cross the street when passing white people at night so they don't think you might mug them"" or ""Even if it's cold, wear tight clothes and don't put your hands in your pockets so they won't be afraid you have a gun?""

Also, I support female empowerment, and the solution to everything you mentioned is to STOP teaching women that every man they see is a threat, not teaching men to bend over backwards to accommodate women's bigoted fears.

5: Translation: ""Continue with the traditional male role of defending damsels in distress; we need a big strong man to defend us.""

6: Translation: ""You're always wrong by virtue of your gender.""

7: This one I can actually support. There ARE cases like ""Oh, well she never said no so I didn't do anything wrong,"" and people of both genders should be educated. I would also endorse couples communicating carefully... not just for legal ass-covering, but because I can't even *imagine* the guilt of misinterpreting a signal and negligently causing trauma to someone you care about.

8: How? We men have very few *options* for contraception. It's reasonable to buy your own shit, and obviously you can't whine about your partner using IUDs or whatever. OTOH, you are perfectly within your rights to refuse to have sex if your *partner* isn't using adequate birth control, up to and including sterilization.

But financing your contraception? Fuck off. First of all, what if I finance your contraception and you don't actually use it? Can I sue you for fraudulently taking my money? Second, women assume the physical risk, but they also have unilateral decision-making power. Third, there is actually a MASSIVE social and financial risk to men.

9: This is a good one.

10: Ehh... no. I'm not opposed to male name-change, keeping names, or whatever, but I think this goes too far in the ""personal is political"" direction.

11: Even if it means working fewer hours? Pulling in less income? Even if it means my wife has to work more hours? And again, there's an ""at least."" So, it's fine if the man does more than his share of the work, but not if the women does?

12: ...am I correct in assuming that this rule is only to be applied when it is corrected by you doing more work? What happens when the informal enforcement is something like ""Guys get stuck splitting all the firewood on a camping trip."" Should I be telling the women to pitch in?

13: I honestly can't see a concrete interpretation of this besides ""Give women more of your money."" And also, I would argue that there is NOT a one-sided power differential in favor of the man.

14: This is a good point, but I'd like to know whether the author would hold women to these same standards.

15: No. This is a completely useless way of supporting Feminism, because feeding trolls is a useless way of doing ANYTHING.

16: ...fuck, that's ballsy as hell. Admitting that men DIE earlier and spinning that as a women's issue because the poor widows don't get a big enough inheritance?

Anyway, don't women control like 80% of consumer spending?

17: I mean... it's reasonable, but this is another one in the category of ""Men not dying is about women.""

18: Erm...

19: What about when the overwhelming majority of perspectives on gender issues are female?

20: I do what I want.

21: ""Treat your female friends better than your male friends.""

22: Fuck off, do you even know anything about being a ""bro?"" Because I'm pretty sure the ""bro"" code often includes letting your friends know when they're making a terrible decision, and would extend to anything in the ""umm, you're being kind of a dick, bro, you might wanna cut that out"" category.

23: ""Remember, everything bad in your relationships is automatically your fault for having a penis!"" Not liking women are ever actually controlling or abusive, no, that's impossible... /s

24: K.

25: Hmm, so have token minority friends, you say?

26: Why? What would I learn? Are you implying that women are better leaders than men?

27: Okay, yeah, cool. This one's reasonable.

28: There's a difference between ""policing"" and ""commenting among friends"" or even just ""enforcing professional dress codes.""

Also, by saying this, you have permanently waived the right to common about ""bro shorts,"" fedoras, neckbeards, or any other aspect of male appearance. I'm pretty sure the Supreme Court ruled on this or something. /s

29: Ahh, good old traditionalism. The harsh outside world is too dangerous for women, they need a big strong man to protect them. There's also a good dose of ""You're expendable, make sure the mugger shoots you instead of her.""

30: This is known commonly as ""being a preachy, self-righteous asshole and alienating everyone you know."" Openly proselytizing for a political movement is a great way to piss people off and make them *less* open to similar opinions in the future, not to mention that you could easily go off half-cocked and criticize someone when you know diddly about their lives.

31: Not unreasonable.

32: Translation: ""Speak only when spoken to. Women have a right to sit in comfortable positions but you don't.""

33: Okay, aside from the inaccuracy of measuring the wage gap in that way since it doesn't account for careers, and aside from the shear fucking GALL of demanding nearly a quarter of someone's income (and by the way, as mentioned women control most household spending, and probably get quite a bit more government spending, so a man who pays taxes is kind of already doing this), if every man donated 23% that wouldn't eliminate the gap, it would REVERSE it. This is beautifully symbolic as a demonstration that you don't actually believe in equality.

34: ...Just a reminder: the author actually typed these exact words and committed them to online publishing. Your maleness is evil, being treated as a full human being is an undeserved privilege, etc, etc, you should hate yourself and your maleness.

Every criticism I have ever made of ""privilege"" just being a tool for guilt-tripping people into silence and obedience, and encouraging a ""tear everyone down to the lowest level of misery"" vision of equality, has just been perfectly demonstrated.

35: eh... if this was on a ""how to be a decent man"" list I'd take exception, but actually identifying as a Feminist does seem like a good way of supporting Feminism, so...

> Speak about feminism as a natural, normal, uncontentious belief, because it should be.

...but this I don't like. Whether you overall agree with Feminism or not, you have to admit that the movement has significant good and bad elements, and this sort of behavior dismisses peoples' legitimate reasons for *not* identifying as Feminist and implicitly brands them as abnormal, evil, or whatever."
14849,"This seems rather imposing as if men who stay silent or stand back are somehow complicit to the sexist actions of others and that men as a whole perpetuate the prelevant sexism. Even if it's a wimpy guy who's afraid to confront the big, strong, chauvinistic dude.

If men have a responsibility to call out sexist guys, then women also too have a responsibility not to sleep with douchebags either. Where guys arguably tend to act the way they do since women are sexually receptive to these type of guys, thus reinforcing their sexist behaviour....even those who've bullied the weak kid in class."
14850,"It was very nice of her to make a list of why I shouldn't support feminism.

It's such a shame that so much work and technology goes into writing such a horrible article. She's extremely sexist and hypocritical and it's a pain to see that another person not only believes that nonsense but is actively spreading it.

Even when she makes a decent point, her justification for it is so bad that it makes me doubt my opinion on it. Before this article I'd have agreed that men should get the HPV vaccine but now I'm not sure."
14851,"XOJane is the site which gave us [this gem.] (http://www.xojane.com/issues/domestic-violence-shelters-for-men)

14852,"How to support women:

1. Do 50% of housework but no more but no more unless compensated.

2. Do 50% of emotional support work but no more. If they need more encourage them to seek other people who support them.

3. Consume cultural products only because you enjoy them. If you produce cultural products do your best to ensure they are enjoyable by both men and women.

4. Give women as much space as you would a man.

5. Interrupt sexism regardless of which gender it comes from.

6. When a woman tells you something is sexist, believe her initially but seek verification independently.

7. Agreed. Also do not have sexual relationships with women who do not do the same.

8. Same as 7.

9. Same as 7.

10. Be politically informed because no movement is perfect enough to support blindly.

11. Agreed, whether you are still with your partner or not.

12. Agreed however be very discerning as to whether adherence to gender roles is due to voluntary choice or indoctrination. If you can't tell, assume it is voluntary.

13. Be mindful of the bidirectional power dynamics inherent in any domestic relationship.

14. Agreed and demand the same in return.

15. Agreed.

16. Same as 14.

17. Agreed.

18. Do not allow anyone to shame you for your sexuality, however you should take care to express it politely, in an appropriate situation, and only to women who have given you clear cause to believe they would be receptive to it.

19. Judge information based on evidence, not who is giving the information.

20. Pick your role models based on their actions, not their gender.

21. Share praise freely and equally.

22. Take the time to seek positive male companionship as much as you do female companionship.

23. If your partner nags you, remind her you deserve more respect. If she does not correct the behavior, end the relationship.

24. Recognize that everyone is sexist towards both men and women in at least some small way. Continually work to improve and expect the same from others.

25. Agreed, and always make sure you are both clear on the nature and trajectory of the friendship.

26. Accept women leaders as readily as men leaders and judge them my their merits I dependant from their gender.

27. When in a romantic relationship, respect that your partner may not have the same relationship with their family as you. You should follow their lead and vice versa.

28. Agreed, however do not be afraid to express your preferences while making it clear they are not an expectation.

29. In areas of possible danger, travelling in groups is safer for all involved.

30. Speak up of you believe anyone is being treated unequally due to their gender.

31. Learn your limits and stick to them. Expect the same from others.

32. Be aware of your surroundings and be considerate to others in a shared space.

33. Professionally you should judge people only by what they contribute, not their gender. Always get paid for the work you do and refuse work that you are not paid to do.

34. Nobody ever needs to apologize for their gender and anyone who expects this is a blatant sexist who is usually not worth your time.

35. Treat others as you would like to be treated. Keep in mind that how they want to be treated may be radically different based on their experiences."
14853,"My summary: some good, some bad, some meh. Fundamentally lacks intersectionality, a ton of nuance and a large chunk of how people are enforcing male gender roles (maleness as universal privilege? no), as well as assumes a perfect feminist partner (which I don't think exists). Also sort of vital to read the first paragraphs that's not part of the list."

My point wasn't that men aren't willing to do it, more that men who do it aren't respected by the type of man who needs to be called out for the way he treats women.

Since I don't really believe there is a ""man card"" that can be revoked I don't really care about being disliked for it.  I don't like spinning my wheels though, and I do feel that they'll ultimately suffer for their attitudes, so I don't usually see the point in calling out random people I see doing shitty things.

When it comes to my friends/family,  I'm much more inclined to privately tell a friend of mine ""Hey buddy, I think that thing you said/did was pretty shitty, and here's why. Totally your prerogative, but I might have to rethink how much interaction we have in the future.""

14913,"> And what if their definition of sexism is such that it disagrees with the other persons definition of sexism.

I mean, my principles are my principles. My definition of sexism, racism, bullying, rudeness, cruelty, or any other negative thing may differ from someone else's. That doesn't mean I won't, when I feel able, stand up for them.

> In this day and age there isn't much it seems that isn't called sexism

You're correct, at this point only Orange Is The New Black, the smell of cookie dough, Hardback books (not softback books, but trade paperbacks are accceptable), wooden ottomans and Ghostbusters (2016) are considered 'not sexist'."
14914,"I think in a male-dominated environment, it's typically going to be easier for me than a woman to call out unacceptable behaviour. I also think the burden shouldn't only be on women to do so.

14915,"Ah, I take this literally. I don't see ""be willing to"" present, so I assume it's ""do 50% or more"" 

The way I see it, the rule makes it nigh impossible for equality to occur, all that's required is one guy doing ""more"" and we couldn't be tipping the scale back, because 50% is the minimum.

I'd see something like ""roughly half"" flying over less poorly."

14919,"And I think I'd be more likely to be called out as a White Knight, which would both re-enforce the sexist attitude from the person I was calling out, and cause them to double down on the sexist behavior they were exhibiting when I called them out.

I also don't see why the burden should fall on me to stand up for someone who isn't willing to stand up for them self, but then again I don't expect others to stand up for me so that could be colouring my opinion."
14920,"Just going with the Jordan-means-black thing. Since half of Africa was colonized by France and half by England, you'll see a lot of French and a lot of English names as surnames.

Creole itself is a mix of French and some other language (it's too far behind for me to know which)."
14921,"Sure, but pretending there isn't some distinction feels pretty disengenous. And if you genuinely think someone may be in distress, a false positive meaning someone thinks for like, three seconds in a crowded club 'is that guy staring at me?' is better than a false negative where someone might need help and doesn't get it."
14922,"I mean, this doesn't have to solely be a sexism thing; if I'm in a situation where I have any kind of influence and someone is doing something harmful whether it's sexism or racism or bullying or whatever, I call them out on it.

If it doesn't change their mind, at least I've gone some way to making that point that X behaviour isn't acceptable. Sometimes you don't change minds, but you can at least change behaviours as a start."
14923,"Ah, I see. I didn't really know the language history behind the surname. I just know that there's a basketball player with Jordan in his name, I think."
14924,"I don't pretend there isn't some distinction. But I admit the distinction is utterly subjective.

And yes, false positives are better than false negatives, but passivity without accountability is easier than action with risk."
14925,"Yeah, I was only using women and sexism because this discussion has been about feminism to date.

I don't believe in using shame and guilt to alter behavior.  It might work on changing their actions, but it rarely works to change their attitude.  And to me, ""call out"" means a public denouncement of what they're doing, which is using guilt and shame to change their behavior.

I do believe in using support to encourage good behavior though, so if some one is willing to call out something I also consider wrong being done to them, I'm willing to support them in that.

>if I'm in a situation where I have any kind of influence

Granting your position that as a man I do have that kind of influence over other men, do you see how this could be read as ""The strong have an obligation to provide for the weak""?"
14926,"> I don't believe in using shame and guilt to alter behavior. It might work on changing their actions, but it rarely works to change their attitude

The reason my grandad stopped using the work 'paki' in public wasn't that he was convinced it was wrong, it was that he realised it wasn't socially acceptable. That is still an improvement to me. Yes, I'd rather convince people, but I'll take just getting them to stop.

> Granting your position that as a man I do have that kind of influence over other men, do you see how this could be read as ""The strong have an obligation to provide for the weak""?

My position is not that 'as a man I do have that kind of influence over other men' as a blanket policy. There are situations where I have influence, situations where I don't and women do, situations where I don't and other men do. It's more nuanced than just 'men have more power in situations than women'."
14927,"Granting that changing behavior is enough of an improvement for you to make it worthwhile to take action, I still don't think using guilt and shame are worth it.  The cost is too high for the reward.  If you can't convince someone of the correctness of your stance, shaming them out of speaking against you isn't an acceptable alternative to me.

Now of course a lot of people haven't been reasoned into their stance, and it's rather well known that you can't reason someone out of a position they haven't been reasoned into, so that's a problem.

>My position is not that 'as a man I do have that kind of influence over other men' as a blanket policy

OK, granting your position that in some circumstances I have that kind of influence over men, can you see how a reasonable person might interpret is as ""The strong have an obligation to provide for the weak""?"
14928,">  I still don't think using guilt and shame are worth it.

If someone does something I think is wrong, if it is not done in ignorance, then implicity I think they should be guilty about it. That's just having the courage of your own convictions.

I don't understand how a logical thought process is 'X did that, that was wrong and he knew it, but I don't think he should feel guilty about it'. It doesn't mean a disproportional amount of guilt, but if someone does something that they know was bad, they should feel bad.

That said, I'll always err on the side of assuming ignorance rather than maliciousness. To come back to Grandpa Carebear; he was used to a situation where Paki was an acceptable term. Just telling him he was a terrible person for using it without at least trying to explain why would be wrong.

> OK, granting your position that in some circumstances I have that kind of influence over men, can you see how a reasonable person might interpret is as ""The strong have an obligation to provide for the weak""?

I'd say it's still oversimplified, given what I said about it being situational I suppose I'd put it more as ""Those in a position of strength have an obligation to support those in a position of weakness""

The person in the position of strength and the person in the position of weakness could completely swap roles in other contexts. Like everyone, there are situations I'm utterly confident in, situations I'm utterly unconfident in, and everything in between."
14929,"I'm just not comfortable telling people that they're ""bad people"".  I think it's far too subjective a claim for me to make.  If they examine their lives and come to the conclusion they're a bad person, that's one thing.  I'm fine with people feeling guilty or ashamed of what they've done, I'm not OK with pushing guilt or shame onto them.

The most I'm willing to say is ""I don't approve of this, and I don't want to be associated with people who do, so while it's entirely your choice if you want to believe/act like this, it's also entirely my choice if I want to have you in my life.""

I also have the (possibly idealist) attitude that they will ultimately suffer for being X-ist.  Most of the really blatant X-ists I know are sad, miserable, lonely people who have a very narrow range of experiences/emotions, and rarely if ever actually feel the joy of being alive.

>""Those in a position of strength have an obligation to support those in a position of weakness""

And I will support someone who stands up for them self.  I will not intercede on their behalf if they haven't done anything on their own.  I tend to try not to impose my will on others when it's in my benefit, why would I try to impose my will on others for the benefit of somebody else?"
14930,"> I'm just not comfortable telling people that they're ""bad people"".

Which wasn't what I suggested either. I've done things I felt guilty for without considering myself a 'bad person'.

Saying ""Bob, that was a shitty thing to do and you should feel like an arsehole about it""  isn't ""BOB YOU WILL ROT IN HELL FOREVER""

> The most I'm willing to say is ""I don't approve of this, and I don't want to be associated with people who do, so while it's entirely your choice if you want to believe/act like this, it's also entirely my choice if I want to have you in my life.""

And you think if you said that to someone they wouldn't potentially feel guilty or ashamed in response? I don't get the distinction between the likely guilt or shame caused by that sentence versus saying 'Bob what you're saying about, I dunno, Sheila's makeup is a shitty thing to say and you should stop doing it'

> I tend to try not to impose my will on others when it's in my benefit, why would I try to impose my will on others for the benefit of somebody else?

Because in many siuations, helping someone else is a moral thing to do - especially if in that situation you are better equipped to help them, or have more authority to make a change than them."
14931,"The distinction I'm making is between pulling Bob aside and saying ""That was a shitty thing you did, and if you keep doing it I don't want to hang out with you anymore"" and standing in the middle of the office saying ""Hey Bob, stop being such a shitty asshole"".  I have a problem with the calling out part of it.  To me, the former is saying ""I don't like people who do X, and if you want me to be friendly towards you you'll stop doing X"" and the second is ""Hey everyone, look how much of an ass Bob is being!""  The guilt part is roughly the same, the shame part is vastly different.

If Sheila were to say in the middle of the office ""Hey Bob, stop criticising my makeup!' and Bob refused, then I'd be more likely to say ""Hey Bob, Sheila asked you to stop doing that, it's kind of a dick move to keep doing it don't you think?"" and that I'd be fine saying in front of everyone, because I'm supporting Sheila in her stated desire to have Bob knock it off, instead of imposing my desire for Bob to knock it off on him.  It may be semantic, but it's how I get through my day.

>Because in many siuations, helping someone else is a moral thing to do 

I absolutely reject that notion of morality, especially when helping someone else comes at a cost to me.  I'm under no obligation to set myself on fire to keep somebody else warm.

Like I said before about x-ists ultimately suffering for their attitudes applies to my take on morality too.  I will, and do, suffer for having that stance, but the suffering I would put myself through under your sense of obligation is far greater."
14932,"> The guilt part is roughly the same, the shame part is vastly different.

The distinction between the imaginary scenarios you just listed was that yours was private and mine was public. I don't know where I gave you the impression that I would publicly and loudly challenge someone like that. It totally depends on the scenario and a million other things, but I certainly wouldn't deliberately leverage being in public as a way to make my point.

> I absolutely reject that notion of morality, especially when helping someone else comes at a cost to me. I'm under no obligation to set myself on fire to keep somebody else warm.

If your obligation of morality is that you won't help people when it costs you anything, I would argue that's an extremely limited sense of morality. You're welcome to apply it, of course, but it's immensely insular."
14933,"Sorry, I thought I had specified upstream that in the context of interrupting X-ism I interpreted ""calling out"" as the sort of public meltdown that ""call out culture"" is notorious for, and that's the part I object to.  I see doing the call out in front of a group of people as more of an attack than an attempt to change attitudes.  I think we're pretty much in agreement on that point.

>If your obligation of morality is that you won't help people when it costs you anything

More that I'm not obligated to help people if I don't find it rewarding to do so.  I can choose to do so, but I'm not a Bad Person for declining the chance to sacrifice in order to make another person happy.

Sometimes I help people at a cost to myself because it gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling to reunite someone with their pet for instance.  Or because I feel good about myself helping another folkie pack their gear into the campground.  Or because I legitimately want to see someone learn something they're having trouble with.  In those cases the reward makes the cost worth incurring.

And I don't deny that my worldview leads me to a very insular place.  I don't even deny that some aspects of my life would be better if I wasn't so cut off from people.  

What I'm saying is that until I learn to balance things better in my head, a worldview that includes me being obligated to help the less fortunate means that I CANNOT take anything for myself.  As long as I'm not literally starving or freezing to death, all my energy and effort HAS to go to people who ARE starving or freezing to death.

That's a flaw in the way I see things, and it's something I put effort towards adjusting.  But until I get passed that flaw, I have to look out for myself because NOBODY ELSE WILL."

Also not a doctor.  But if I were you I'd continue to note how you're feeling.  Gardasil has a reputation for creating some bad effects (more than temporary) in some recipients.  

I'd also make sure you were lying down for any future vaccinations or bloodwork.  My teenaged daughter passed out so quickly after her meningitis shot, that she collapsed, fell off the exam table, and sustained a pretty bad concussion.  "
14935,I have no idea if you should continue with more shots but I would think that would be a fairly common side effect... sort of a panic and faint combo.. wouldn't be fun. But you are smaller and maybe didn't eat a full meal prior? Or dehydrated

Always go to the source first.

>WHAT ARE THE MOST COMMON SIDE EFFECTS OF GARDASIL 9?
The most common side effects include pain, swelling, redness, itching, bruising, bleeding, and a lump where your child got the shot, headache, fever, nausea, dizziness, tiredness, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and sore throat. Fainting can happen after getting GARDASIL 9. Sometimes people who faint can fall and hurt themselves. For this reason, your health care professional may ask your child to sit or lie down for 15 minutes after your child gets GARDASIL 9. Some people who faint might shake or become stiff. The health care professional may need to treat the person getting GARDASIL 9.

You fainted. This is not a serious side effect.

Should you finish? Uh...yeah."
14937,"I see. I'll keep note if I feel anything weird. 
As for lying down, I'll do that from now on.
I hope your daughter made/makes a full recovery from that concussion.
Thank you for all of your advice!"
14938,"Eh I had a pretty full meal with a good diversity of food before hand. As for dehydration, it's possible considering I usually don't drink a lot of water and I also had my urine test right before.

I was told afterwards that the HPV vaccination was more likely to cause side effects than most of the other ones. And seemed I was one of those lucky people. As for panicking, not really. Fainting and other side effects though, yeah it was not fun at all."
14939,Sorry to hear about that. You advice is duly noted. I hope you the best for whatever's to come
14940,"The vaccine is not just for preventing cervical cancer but also HPV related penile, anal and pharyngeal (throat) cancers. HPV is very prevalent, contagious and you're not fully protected from it just by using a condom. "
14941,"1) Why are you discussing your future fertility with your mom's gynecologist as a male (unless I'm missing something?) 2) Your mom's gynecologist dissuading young women from getting this vaccine is terrible practice. 3) page 13, section 1 provides your relevant documentation http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/UCM111263.pdf


EDIT: GET THE VACCINE. "
14942,"The science is settled, the HPV vaccine is safe and effective.  Get it now because it may protect someone you love in the future."
14943,I was part of the human trials for this vaccine. Hence I am one of the oldest people with this vaccine. I am glad I got it. It brings me peace of mind. 
14944,"Get the vaccine. It is very safe. There has been a lot of hysteria around this particular vaccine mostly because people are upset because it protects against an STI and seem to think that getting it will somehow convince kids to have sex earlier. There's no evidence that this vaccine causes any nasty side effects other than the very rare risk of allergy (which is why you stay in the doctors office for 15 mins after any vac). It has also so far been shown to be very effective.

Now is the time to get it - before you are sexually active & it will offer you the maximum benefit."
14945,"23/F. The vaccine was shockingly new when I got the series at age 14/15 by the suggestion of my GP. That was the ONE thing I hadn't intensely researched before jumping into. I had all 3 shots and had no ill side effects, not even the common fever/rash/upset stomach that comes with routine vaccinations. I am also 27 weeks pregnant today, so certainly not infertile! I also have a very aggressive autoimmune disease and have been on immunosuppressants since the age of 14, and I still didn't have ill effects. 

Do your research. Consult with trusted adults in your life, but get many opinions; don't just listen to your mom/her gynos opinions and accept what they say without many other opinions and extensive research; It is your life and your sexual health, and it's your body! Be well informed, and go from there."
14946,Just get the vaccine. It's harmless and can protect you and the women you love in the future from needless suffering. 
14947,"this vaccine is good, for me even males should get it (for the transmission).
all medical practice has some risks, but you have to see the pro and cons. the risk of side effect is smaller than the benefit. even aspirine has side effect but in case of need you use it because the headache is worst than a low possibility of  hemorrhage.as everything: when you take your car to go somewhere you can have an accident, but the risk to have it is lower than the benefit to go where you want.
another thing:
if your sink is broken you call the plumber and trust him about what is right to do to fix the problem. is it's work and he know how to fix this kind of problems.
for your health is the same thing. you have to trust who know more than you, because this is his work. you have to ask to get all the information from your doctor, not from a friend of yours.
"
14948,So this doesn't directly answer your question but I think it is important to think of the broader effect this vaccine can potentially have. First off this vaccines does not cover all strains of HPV. It covers 3 strains out of about 20.  You can still be infected with the other strains. Secondly cervical cancer has other causes aside from HPV (i.e. We now have data to show that women that have been vaccinated still can have abnormal Pap smears) . By widely vaccinated young women and men we are giving a false sense of security that they are protected from HPV and cervical cancer when in fact they are not fully covered. This false sense of protection has the potential to lead to more couples having unprotected sex as well as young women skipping their annual Pap smears (I cannot remember my source but I was reading about the percent of women getting annual Pap smears in European countries is dropping at a significant rate. There was an even more alarming rate with women that had been vaccinated. Until recently the HPV vaccine has been used more widely in Europe than in the US) I am making no claims to the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Although I will say that the current studies have only shown efficacy out to 5 years. Longer studies have not been published). I am however pointing out that this vaccines could have a major negative public health effect and thus does more harm than good in an indirect fashion. Please make sure that any women you know are continuing to get their annual Pap smear and manages their sexual health. Screening is still the best way to manage this disease regardless of the vaccine. 
14949,"23/F here also, got the vaccine at the same (13/14) age by REQUEST OF MY MOM to my doctor, even though I was years away of having sex. At the time it wasn't something I'd think about for myself, but I'm glad my mom did for me. Get the vaccine, don't listen to these people. You'll be glad you did and you'll be protecting yourself and your future partners. 

I congratulate you, as a male, for making this decision. It's really responsible. I wish my soon-to-be-fiancé would get it, but he doesn't seem to be listening to me, so I just dropped the subject. I think this is very important for both F and M. Keep us updated on your decision! "
14950,Men can get HPV related cancer so it is protective for them too. 
14951,"safe belt reduce the risk of death in an accident but it can't avoid it.  
unsafe sex is danger not (only) for the HPV but all the others pletora of infection like HIV etc...
I think any female will continue her check up routine as usual."
14952,You are absolutely wrong. 
14953,"What a load of rubbish. Cervarix covers the 2 strains of HPV that account for 70% of cases of cervical cancer and Gardisil also covers an additional 2 strains that cause the majority of cases of genital warts. No one has said women can stop their pap smears. 

What an idiotic statement ""women might not have their paps so let's not vaccinate and prevent 70% of cervical cancers at all""

Oh I know, how about we just remind women that even if they've been vaccinated, they still need to have pap smears?

And as if anyone's not using condoms because they think they can't get cervical cancer. ""Oh Fred, where's the condom, I don't want cervical cancer"" lmao. If the threat of pregnancy/HIV/herpes/gonorrhoea etc isn't enough to encourage condom use, HPV is hardly going to be the one that does it.

Oh no, the long term efficacy is only at 5 years. I wonder if that's because it's a new vaccine. You forgot to mention that the results were outstanding and the researchers found not one case of cervical atypia in women who had the vaccine prior to becoming sexually active. The efficacy is even better than the researchers could ever imagine.

Also OP is male and this vaccine will also protect against certain mouth, throat, penile and anal cancers. 
Vaccination + regular pap smears is the best way to prevent cervical cancer.

TLDR: you have no idea what you are talking about"
14954,"I know, but all the campaigns threat female vaccination. I don't know why"
14955,"Your response goes to show just how sensitive everyone is on the topic of vaccines. We are so comfortable with accepting that drugs and surgery might have a negative outcome but to suggest ANY downsides to vaccination and you are immediately attacked in an unfair and inaccurate way. I ask you to look back and read what I actually said. No where in my post did I say the young man should not get the vaccine. You put these words into my mouth, even went as far as inaccurately quoting me and I don't appreciate it.

 ""What an idiotic statement ""women might not have their paps so let's not vaccinate and prevent 70% of cervical cancers at all""


The intention of my post was to provide context rather than give advice on if I think he should get the vaccine. I am simply asking you to look at it from a public health stand point. I am NOT saying Health care providers should skip the vaccine. I AM saying they should understand and recognize the correlation to young women skipping Pap smears. Patients should be heavily advised that the vaccine should not and cannot replace an annual Pap smear. "
14956,"If you knew anything about medicine, you would know that annual pap smears are no longer recommended. Please refrain from offering medical advice."
14957,"The reason why people are sensitive is because vaccines are arguably THE greatest medical advancement in terms of public health. And antivaxers have done so much damage to vaccination programs, putting lives in danger.

Don't go backflipping now. You said the disadvantages outweighed the benefits. Now you are claiming you were just trying to say women should still have their paps? (2 or 3 or 5 yearly btw, depending on the country) Seems an odd answer to a male OP asking if he should get the vaccination."
14958,"First off to make sure you understand HPV and herpes are very different. Herpes is for life while HPV is a virus that most people fight off the infection. 

Check out this website , has a lot of information . And unless you develop cancer, nobody is a long term sufferer from HPV. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/infectious-agents/hpv/hpv-and-hpv-testing.html 


Depending on how old your partner is, he could get a vaccine too! But there is no blood test for HPV in men. "
14959,"No there is no blood test for HPV. An HPV test checks for the genetic material (DNA) of the human papillomavirus. Like a Pap test, an HPV test is done on a sample of cells collected from the cervix camera."
14960,"Thank you SO much for this information!! I find that VERY reassuring. 

I guess I feel like I've been on a real 'journey' with understanding herpes (+ the fact that it's lifelong) and it kind of scares me that there could be a similar amount of unknown info about HPV that I'm about to find out! but so good to know that warts can be fought off. 

Thank you for the info sheet- that was really useful. 

I had no idea that men could also get a vaccine! We are 25 though and he has had 8 other partners..."
14961,"Thank you so much for your help. So as a woman, the only thing I can do to protect myself would be to get Gardasil 9 asap (only had 1 sexual partner, but he's had 6 others inc 2 unprotected) and always have a good look at my partner's genitals?"
14962,">So as a woman, the only thing I can do to protect myself would be to get Gardasil 9 asap

and use protection when you have sexual contact.

> always have a good look at my partner's genitals? 

HPV does not always show symptoms, if your partner is experiencing symptoms(genital warts) obviously avoid contact but this is not always the case. According to the CDC ""if you are sexually active you can get HPV, and nearly all sexually active people get infected with HPV at some point in their lives""  

you just need to wear protection and be have your partners be honest with there sexual health. Unfortunately for me this was not the case and I've had HPV (genital warts) for about a year now. Finally starting to show sings of the symptoms going away.  
 "
14963,"Oh of course. The only time I'll go without condoms is if I get married xD 

Do condoms protect against HPV or is it like HSV/herpes, i.e. you can get warts anywhere within the 'boxer zone' region? 

(But obviously I see your point and would much rather warts around my inner thighs than inside my actual vagina, for instance)

Yeah, absolutely. My bf and I have been tested for almost everything, or as much as everything as we could do via bloods... but I'll still have to ask him to let me know if he sees something unusual.

I'm sorry to hear that your partner was not honest with you. It sucks to suffer from others' negligence. Thank you for your help and I hope you get well soon."
14964,">Do condoms protect against HPV or is it like HSV/herpes, i.e. you can get warts anywhere within the 'boxer zone' region? 

It is skin to skin contact that will spread the virus. If the condom is not protecting the exposed skin, the virus can be passed on. In my case a condom would not have helped because the warts are not on my penis but just above on the skin (where a condom does not protect) 



and thank you! I hope one day it does clear up.

15059,"Sounds really similar to my experiences, not wanting to grow old... especially with sexuality and the 'phantom limb' feeling. I can't tell how you to feel, but you sound like a very introspective person. Take some small steps and see how you feel. Do whatever you feel comfortable doing to take on a masculine appearance, and see how that goes. It's also a good idea to focus on your mental health, first and foremost. Depression and other mental illnesses can be caused by dysphoria; however, it's not a good idea to let them go unchecked while you figure out the gender stuff. Therapy can help; if you don't feel good about your current therapist, try and see if there's an LGBT-friendly one you can go to instead.

Anyway, you're welcome here with all the rest of us! The confused, the doubtful, and the certain... everyone has a place here. Don't be afraid, and explore yourself/your identity in a way that makes sense to you."
15060,"You sound textbook trans. You're not making it up. If you're not trans, I'd be incredibly shocked.

Transition won't fix everything - if you have avpd/bpd, you'll still have them. Some people find their self-hatred and depression go away easily; some have to work at it a lot more. Not everyone who had a problem with self-harming stops, though some do.

Talk to a therapist if you think it would be helpful to you - if they're professional they won't think you're making this up; if they're not professional, get a therapist that is. If you're in an area where it takes months or years to get HRT, start getting on the right lists for that (if you're in an area where you can get it in a couple weeks via informed consent, don't rush yourself). Find out what it takes to get top surgery in your area.

The vast majority of trans guys blend in with cis guys after 1-3 years physically transitioning.

Good luck."

15064,"3-4 weeks is right. Just be vigilant. 

I unfortunately found out when I was doing some grooming. I was treated with Imiqimod, but it didn't work as well as we had hoped so I had to have them chemically cauterized (read: OUCH). 

And everyone is right- HPV is super common and even with condoms it's easily transmitted but is through dermal contact. Once your body fights it off, you be good. It might reoccurring, but as long as you catch early the treatment is quick and easy.

FYI: some people don't understand and have super negative reactions when you disclose. Once you are cleared, you really don't have an obligation to talk about it.
"
15065,"Between 60 and 80 percent of sexually active people have at least one strain of HPV. It's no big deal if you've never been symptomatic. In your case, you have had symptoms, so until you're asymptomatic again for a couple months, you should probably fly solo. Follow your doctor's advice, and when you do your nut check every few months (testicular self-exam), take a look for any new spots on your dick. If something changes, go back to the doctor. If you remain asymptomatic, it's not really anybody else's business since, again, between 60 and 80 percent of sexually active people have at least one strain of HPV and most don't know it (nor would they have any reason to suspect they do, since they've never had any symptoms)."

15072,"^ THIS.^

Close to 75% of the sexually active population have some form of HPV. While some variants can cause unsightly warts, some just seem to lay dormant, while others actively try to bloom into a cancer. If you have a healthy immune system, your body should act to suppress the virus. The cancer causing variants are responsible for cervical cancer and rectal cancer. Some can be passed to other areas of the body, but rarely become cancerous.

Oh, and you can transfer the virus without sexual contact. It can transfer by touch, so if you go take a piss and don't wash your hands, you can transfer it to the next person you shake hands with. This is why the virus is so omnipresent.

Listen to your primary or specialist doctor, whichever one you trust the most."

I've had a number of surgeries and biopsies to keep on top of this, but if I believed that it was impossible for it to become cancer and ignored it, I'd have it by now. My current doctor uses hi-res microscope to locate abnormal cells and kills them with infrared light. 

I guess what I'm saying is, I'm speaking from experience here. I've had the warts, but they are long gone. Now I'm just dealing with the other virus that keeps trying to become cancer. No joke, it's a pain in the butt for real."

15088,"Thank you, but I'd like your feedback even if it is not a professional one. "

15092,Is my fear unwarranted?
15093,"> But they didn't say anything if the vaccine works on adult men or encouraged adult men to get vaccinated.

To be effective, the vaccine has to be given before the person is exposed to the HPV virus. Given how prevalent it is today, that essentially translates to ""before the person becomes sexually active"". This is why they normally vaccinated kids at about 12 or 13.

So for nearly all of us in this sub, it's simply too late to get vaccinated."
15094,"The delayed rollout of the vaccine is really criminal in my opinion.

It should have been made available to all, covered by the health plans, immediately.

Believe it or not, there are people who don't have a large number of sex partners, and who could benefit from the vaccine.  Indeed, given the low value placed on monogamy and marriage these days, the dissolution of a marriage (that is to say, most marriages) will likely result in an increase in sex, for men over the age cutoff, and a corresponding increase in exposure to cancer-causing HPV."

15105,"I'm not a doctor but I don't think I agree with yours.

The risks are different for men than for women. As a man, your greatest health risk from HPV would be oropharyngeal cancer followed by anal cancer and penile cancer coming in a distant third.

Then there are genital warts. 

Here's why I can't agree with your doctor:

The vaccine covers the two strains that cause greater than 90% of all HPV related cancers that men get (HPV 16 and HPV 18). 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4299160/

https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/infectious-agents/hpv-fact-sheet

So the risk of getting a strain of HPV that can cause cancer associated with HPV would be reduced to less than 10% by vaccination. There is already a slim chance that you'd actually get cancer from a high risk strain of HPV.

Depending on when you got the vaccine, it may cover some strains that reduce the remaining risk of HPV related cancers even further. (The latest, Gardasil 9, covers another 5 strains of known high risk HPV strains).

In addition, unless you received Cervarix (which was popular in the UK for a while), your vaccine also covered the two strains that are responsible for 90% of all genital wart type HPV infections.

So I'd say your risk of HPV related cancer is very, very low. You can reduce it further by refraining from giving her oral sex and don't involve your anal area in your escapades. Penile cancer is rare anyway and the vaccine makes it extremely rare. Use a condom and you've covered your last risk area.

That leaves a 10% chance you could get genital warts - if that's the type of HPV she has. Use a condom to reduce the 10% risk further. The problem with the wart causing varieties is that a condom ONLY covers your shaft and the virus can set up shop anywhere in the general area. Then you masturbate or have more sex and spread it around the area.

Still, the CDC estimates that 90% of all HPV infections clear within 2 years and most of those within 6 months.

So you have low risk already, you can reduce it further, and if you do get an infection, there's a 90% chance it will go away within 2 years anyway.

Having said all that, the risks aren't all yours. If you don't plan on making this a long term monogamous relationship and you pick up a strain that wasn't part of your vaccination, you can give it to your partners.

It looks like you're heterosexual. Women are at greater risk of HPV cancers than men. There's that.

Otherwise, I'd say you have very little to be concerned about and...way to go to your prospective partner for disclosing. I'd like to shake her hand."

It was free and optional for me, so I said why not? I believe it took three shots that had to be done a few months a part. 

I was told that men can be carriers and not even know it. 

I hope someone else has more information about it."
15108,"You realize HPV is just warts, right?  Everyone gets it.  Literally everybody.  Most people will have an HPV infection four or five times in their lives.

A few strains of HPV are correlated with some uncommon and fairly treatable forms of cancer.  Moreover, even if you or your partner does develop cancer, it won't be for decades, and for all you know, there will be an over-the-counter cure for it."
15109,"Thanks gor your answer, I'll call my doctor in the morning and see what I can do! I didn't know there was a 9 stran vaccination, I only knew about the 4 version!

It bugs me a lot that I cannot test for HPV [AFAIK] since i will never know if i have it now...I've had multiple partners in the past, some of which were in the 30s or very sexually active so I don't know, how should I go when we walk about std and such with a new partner? I'll be sure to tell them that I don't know since there are no tests avaible but I never had symptoms, is this OK?

About the open relationship, we're still trying to understand if this fits for us, we've been togheter 3 years as monogamous partners. Sincerely i don't know how I would feel if really she could hook around and I couldn't for a year, I don't think I would be happy about it...do you think this means I'm not ready for this kind of relationship?.

I don't mean to offend ppl that have HPV at all, I respect them and they are no different than me but if I can Dodge this ""bullet"", why not??

15113,"> Getting the vaccine for a disease that is pretty common is the right answer

The vaccine only covers the ""dangerous"" strains.

> if I can Dodge this ""bullet"", why not??

""If"".  In fact, vaccine or no vaccine, sex or no sex, you are going to get HPV.

I would recommend the vaccine, but only barely.  It costs about $500; you would probably extend your life longer by spending the same money on, for example, buying a safer car, but a vaccine has ancillary advantages beyond just keep you personally from getting sick.

"
15114,"Thanks for sharing! we talked a lot about it in the past months and we understood that we want this, I think I can accept her having sex and some feelings (but me and my gf sould remain the main partners) for other and so does her, but I think that we need to actually have some other partners to be sure of this. "
15115,"The vaccine cover the strain that are more common by a large margin, there are strain that are dangerous but not covered afaik. And it's been proven to keep you safer from warts and cancer, even if men were immune to this cancer [which they aren't] I would still feel the need to get this since I don't want to pass it to a woman that may not have it, I don't see your reasoning, money is money but we waste money every day, if it costs that much I'll save up for it and give it to me as a present \gift lol"
15116,"> I don't see your reasoning, money is money but we waste money every day

Well, stop doing that!

> if it costs that much I'll save up for it

You might be better off saving up for (for example) better tires for your car.

I mean, maybe not, but keep it in perspective."
15117,"HPV is extremely common, and can be picked up as soon as one gets sexually active. that does not mean that one is sick. "
15118,The vaccine would not make your HPV test positive. HPV is the virus that causes warts. So if you've ever had a wart then you have had HPV. The HPV vaccine helps with a fee strains of HPV that have been linked with cancer.  So it doesn't prevent warts but can prevent cervical cancer. 
15119,"The vaccine is made from a synthesized protein that mimics the protein of the viruses capsid (coating). So no. The vaccine would not cause her to test positive for HPV.

There are more than a hundred strains of the Human papillomavirus and 40 of those are ""STI's"". Most don't cause warts or any other symptoms so almost everyone who is sexually active gets at LEAST one HPV STI during their life. 

Women under 30 don't typically get tested for HPV. They get Pap smears. A Pap smear is a cancer screen. If you have an irregular Pap smear, it's because you have HPV but it's possible to have HPV without having an irregular Pap smear. 

The whole point in getting a Pap test is to make sure that a **persistent** HPV infection isn't causing your cervical cells to mutate.

You with me so far?

We used to get Pap smears every year but since the advent of the HPV vaccine in 2006, the US guidelines now recommend Pap smears only once every three years until you're 30. THEN you get a Pap every 5 years WITH an HPV test. You could, in theory, have and clear several HPV infections between Paps.

The only other time a woman gets an HPV test is if she is at risk of cancer, i.e., she's already had two irregular Pap smears so we know something is up. Then they'll test for ""high risk"" strains of HPV only. It still wouldn't tell her definitively if she had any other strain of HPV.

YOU won't get an HPV test either. Neither HPV nor HSV are part of standard STI screening because they are so prevalent, impossible to track, and incurable anyway.
>I know it tends to affect women more strongly than men and I've also heard that there are age windows for the vaccine. Can anyone confirm or deny this?

Yes and no. Women have cervixes and so they get cervical cancer which is the most common HPV **cancer**. But MEN are more likely to have persistent HPV infections and have more HPV infections in general. The cancer risk may have to do with something as simple as the topography of the cervix cells/tissue.

Edit: age window - [Merck, Gardasil 9](https://www.merckvaccines.com/Products/Gardasil9)
>GARDASIL 9 is indicated in males 9 through 26 years of age for the prevention of anal cancer caused by HPV Types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; precancerous or dysplastic lesions caused by HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58; and genital warts caused by HPV Types 6 and 11.

The age indication is for at least two reasons: 1) you get a better immune response in younger people and, more importantly, 2) once you've been exposed to the virus, you've likely already built up an immune response. It makes less and less sense the older and more exposed you've been because it's not free. You may still be able to convince your doctor that you need it but you might have to pay out of pocket.

HPV causes anal, penile and oropharyngeal cancers too. Obviously, you're the only sex that has to worry about penile HPV related cancer but it's rare anyway. However, 50% of HPV related anal cancers occur in men and you don't necessarily have to be having sex with men to get it there - you just need a mode of transfer. It's transferred from skin to skin contact but may be transferred by shared toys etc too (much less likely).

Most importantly, oropharyngeal HPV cancers disproportionately affect men. HPV 16 causes more than half the cervical cancers and 90% of the oropharyngeal, anal and penile cancers. You get it most commonly from performing oral sex on an infected partner.

Don't blame your partner for not knowing she had HPV. There is a good chance you gave it to her. If you didn't, you probably have had at least one infection from someone else.

ALL of these cancers are relatively rare, especially considering how prevalent the virus is."
15120,"When did you last get bloodwork done? Was your thyroid stuff checked?

15127,"All the best dickscience1 - I've got no problem with regime.

The gardasil, Tyginta and AHCC supps are great and working together I've no doubt that you'll get your GW sorted. Just a quick question about the ACV...

Must've hurt like hell considering the location of your GW. I've had mixed results with ACV so I wouldn't write it off completely. The location like you mentioned is difficult for any treatment.
"
15128,"I'll try to keep this thread updated as changes occur.

At the moment I have yet to get the AHCC or the tygantine. Long shipping times. Hoping next week it arrives"
15129,"Yeah. it did. I would be doubled over in pain for at least 10 minutes after ""placing"" it on. Then minor stinging throughout the day. Since my last treatment with the ACV i've been putting vitamin E infused polysporin on the area to heal it up. Which it has quite well.

Got the AHCC in the mail today, still waiting on the tyginta shipment. I'm going to start them both at the same time and update as any progress shows."
15130,My Tyginta order took about 3 weeks to arrive although they mentioned this in the order email. Apparently it comes from New Zealand so understandably takes a little longer than usual.
15131,"First off, the HPV vaccine is worthwhile.  It prevents throat cancer, penile cancer, and anal cancer in men.  Plus it prevents them from spreading it to their partners.  So don't feel bad about having given him the vaccine.

Was the vaccine given by a nurse practitioner, physician's assistant, nurse, or pharmacist?  If given by a nurse practitioner, or physician's assistant I would call the insurance company and ask what is going on...  if given by the other two it may in fact have required a referral from a doctor / NP / PA.

That said, I would go to the minute clinic and argue that this is their problem and they misrepresented your insurance coverage, and negotiate a discount if nothing else."
15132,"What worries me is the words you used of her saying ""should be covered"" and ""shouldn't cost anything"". 

At this point, I would strongly suggest trying to obtain a retro (back-dated) authorization/referral for the immunization. The clinic should try to obtain this for you, if not then you can attempt it on your own as well. You can do an official appeal if the clinic doesn't get this auth/referral for you. 

If that doesn't work, your next bet would be to contact the clinic and ask them to pay the cost of the vaccine vs. the billed amount since you were told what you were told by the clinic, may not work, but it would be worth the try. Pay for the cost of the medicine and the cost of injection and that should save you money there. "
15133,"I am looking through the Office Visit report from that day but see no official title next the the provider's name. But I am 99% sure she was a nurse practitioner (RN). I have a feeling that despite the HPV vaccine having proven benefits for males too, it's not deemed as necessary by insurance companies to get it without a specific referral. So do you think it is much more wiggle room when speaking with the Minuteclinic billing office as opposed to speaking with the insurance company?"
15134,"While getting a retro authorization for the immunization would solve this, I am slightly concerned that they might ask why I needed the HPV vaccine to start with, since I don't fall in the high risk category for males who would need HPV vaccination. Either way it sounds like there is more room for negotiation with the billing company rather than contacting the insurance company to pay for the vaccine?"
15135,"HPV is a preventative vaccination, if they bill it out with a V code it should be covered and paid for....if auth/referral is given. However, having said that, I've never heard of needing a referral or authorization for an immunization. I would call the insurance company first (or billing company) and find out what DX code was used to bill out the injection, that can tell you (or us) a lot. "
15136,"Here's what I see:  

90651: 9VHPV VACCINE 3 DOSE SCHEDULE FOR IM USE  
Diagnoses: Z23"
15137,"Those codes do match up. I would recommend calling the insurance company first, asking them why they didn't pay the claim (verify the reason you've already been given) then ask them how to go about getting a retro-authorization. Also, ask about the difference between a referral and an authorization with their company, and how to go about getting a retro one and who would have to get it, can you get it or does the clinic have to?

I understand your thought process on negotiating with the billing company vs. the insurance company, but unless you play out all your cards with the ins co you may be SOL as a lot of billing services and doctor's office will treat the EOB as gospel and will not make any more adjustments. 

Another point, if, after a few phone calls you are getting no satisfaction it may be in your best interest to simply pay the bill (you can even make monthly payments that you can arrange) as you will need to decide at what point is the amount worth the time and aggravation that you may go through. 
"
15138,"I've worked, and now studying, in the clinical aspect of medicine my entire life and yet have 0 confidence when it comes to the financial aspect of it. So thank you for your guidance.  

I'll contact the insurance company first as per your instructions before contacting Minuteclinic billing office. I realize that there is a real possibility that I might have to cough up the bill and take it as a life lesson but it does worry me not knowing what I really did wrong, as I'm still pretty sure vaccinations should be covered w/o referral. I'll let you know how it goes!"

15141,Virtually everyone has HPV at some point.  A quarter of the female population has it _at any given time_.
15142,"You'll probably want to consult a doctor that knows their kit about HPV.

As I recall, the kinds of HPV that cause (genital) warts don't cause cervical cancer, so it's entirely possible that her strain of HPV won't cause throat or mouth cancer if you already have it or contract it.

Blowjobs are generally supposed to have a low rate of STI transmission to the receiver IIRC, especially with condoms in play."
15143,"Ask your doc. 

For the record, the strains associated with cancer generally do not cause warts, and vice versa, so the vaccine you've gotten is unlikely to protect you from the strain she has."
15144,FWIW the vaccines for HPV only protect against four strains and there are many many more. Being vaccinated is not a fail safe. 
15145,"Go and see your doctor about it, tell him what she has and what vaccines you have taken. That would be your best bet.

Personally I would avoid someone with HPV."
15146,"Why not ask her? She's surely the one that can inform you the better.

Your views on it and hers should coincide anyway. Maybe she's of the opinion that you shouldn't care about getting it, and you may not be okay with that."
15147,"I've read quite a bit about it, but still not really sure how to proceed in terms of practicality. Even things such as sharing drinks etc. "

"
15150,"Thanks for this. I was doing fine for a while when I (thought) I knew that it was confined to my genitals. When I started seeing symptoms in my mouth, I just went over the edge, because apparently oral HPV is rare and is associated with higher cancer risk. I have an appointment with a dermatologist soon to look at the wart I have on my genitals as well as some other weird skin things that started happening after I was diagnosed...do you think I'd be saving my time and money if I just went straight to an immunologist? I also read that a dentist can identify oral HPV but I'm not sure if that's true. I think the worst thing is all the misinformation online. "
15151,"I self diagnosed the warts and got it confirmed by four dermatologists. An infectologist and an ear-nose-throat specialists weren't sure about the growths in my throat and the surgeon didn't think they looked like warts but I was frightened just like you and asked for a biopsy. Turns out she was right.

The immunologist never even took a look at my warts or the growths in my throat. I only went to him because it was obvious that my immune system wasn't working the way it should have been, which he confirmed with blood tests and my then recent medical history.  

I don't have experience with dentists diagnosing HPV and given my experiences with ""specialists"" who should know anything and everything about it, I don't even trust them all automatically, let alone someone who specializes in a different field. "
15152,"Alright, I'll probably try and get a biopsy on the mouth stuff then. They can tell you the exact strain of HPV it is by doing one, right? How did you go about finding a surgeon? I'm sorry for asking so many questions; I'm trying to amass all the information I can from people who actually have personal experience with it for my own sanity. I'm really sick of the nausea and random cry sessions that follow any sort of internet scouring. "
15153,"Well, it wasn't HPV so I don't know if they would have been able to tell me the type if it had been. Think twice before getting a biopsy and then think again. You will be on painkillers for two weeks and anything you use your mouth for is going to hurt as hell. And it very well might all be for nothing. The ENT doc arranged the biopsy for me with the surgeon. If any of them tell you it's unnecessary, believe them. "
15154,"So then who do you think would be best to go to for a visual diagnosis? I'm also afraid of treating the symptoms because then they won't be able to tell. I guess it's like, I can get a biopsy and know for sure if it's strain 6, 11, or the high risk cancer ones, or I can get a visual diagnosis and not know for sure if it is the safe kind or the cancer kind. "
15155,See an ENT if you must. Explain that you have been diagnosed with genital warts and you're worried that the growths in your mouth are HPV related. 
15156,"Someone else mentioned this below, but the >26 y/o old thing is a recommendation based on a lot of different things. From the CDC:

""...(they)considered data on vaccine efficacy and safety, disease burden attributable to HPV, cost-effectiveness of vaccination, and programmatic issues to develop recommendations.""

http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6304a1.htm?s_cid=mm6304a1_w

What that means in practice is that after 26, the probability that you already have been exposed to one of the 4 strains that vaccine protects against is high enough that the risk of the vaccine (teeny tiny) and the cost (quite high) mean that the it's not recommended. Remember though that in making these recommendations, they look at everything at a macro level. It doesn't mean that the vaccine will work any differently if you are over 26 or that there will be some kind of adverse reaction. The CDC said it better

""HPV vaccines are not licensed in the United States for use in persons aged >26 years. Among women, the expected population-level impact of HPV vaccination in this age group is lower than that for younger women because of the higher likelihood that women have already had vaccine type infection, because fewer would have incident infection that could be prevented and the risk for development of disease from incident infection is less (199).""



More from this: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6305a1.htm

""Although HPV4 is not licensed by FDA for use among persons aged >26 years, studies among females aged 27–45 years indicate that the adverse events profile is comparable to the profile observed in those aged 9–26 years (11).""

This is an important point as well:

""Although vaccination is still recommended, patients should be advised that vaccination will not have any therapeutic effect on an existing HPV infection, HPV-associated precancer lesion, cancer, or anogenital warts""

I didn't have the words to describe our relationship when the woman who's now my wife and I went to that clinic seeking birth control a decade ago, but the whole way they talked about sex told me they wouldn't judge. I hope PP is as good nationally as it seems to be in Colorado."
15159,"You seem to have done your research so you probably know but why didn't you mention it? That HPV is very common and very easily spread and there is no test for overall HPV presence. The reason people should get the shots before they start being sexually active, is that the more partners they have, the higher the likelihood of them already being infected and there is no way to find out whether that is the case or not. In which case the vaccine might be useless. "
15160,"Thanks for posting your experiences with this since that vaccine is very new and giving it to men is even a more recent recommendation so there is very little information available, let alone actual personal accounts of research leading up to vaccination.

15163,">the whole treatment was quoted as $595 in three different payments.


Holy smokes! I got all shots for free ( and so did every other girl that consented to it in my school). Yey for Canada I suppose? And yey for you! "
15164,"Thanks for this post. I remember the nurse telling me about it at my last visit (for the hepatitis a and b) and i checked the price. It's 3000 sek... So at about 300 euros, it for me too expensive.

The thing is... Had I been born one year later it would have been free and I would definitely have taken it."
15165,"I got the shot, it was $170 a shot, and my benefits did not cover it.
It honestly hurt like a bitch. I get bloodwork done and got my Hep shots and boosters recently, but nothing hurt like the Gardasil shot did."
15166,"BTW, OP:

This is very location specific. PP where I am (and the on-campus University health services) ABSOLUTELY refused to give me the HPV vaccine because I am a 28yoF. Thus too old.
I was a monogamous person with my husband, and we were virgins when we met. Thus, the potential benefits of the vaccine before the poly were EXCEPTIONALLY high. Still, no dice.

I eventually ended up going to Canada, my socialist nation of birth to get the vaccines (which I still had to pay for, as the public health department of Canada also felt I was too old). Luckily I got a few doc's to scam me some gardasil for the cost of 'injections' for two of them. Otherwise it's 275 an injection, (and if you're american, you pay for this visit as well).

Anyways, my 35ish metamour and 40yo SO have been trying to get the vaccine in our state for years and have constantly been faced with opposition. Their (the drs, nurses, government's) idea is that if you've already been exposed, it's a waste of money. However, only YOU know how likely your exposure is!

As a scientist, I've read the primary literature, of which you might want to know about:

If you haven't been exposed to the strain, and follow the vaccination schedule, the protection is close to 99%.
If you have been exposed to 1-3 of the strains, the vaccine WILL still protect for the one (or more) you haven't been exposed to with similar efficacy.
A large study on older females (up to age 45) showed that it was still effective.
"
15167,"I'll sacrifice some imaginary points here. 

i agree with your final note, however, do you really need to be a dick about it when no one is even disagreeing with you? it doesn't make you any better than the people that are on the other side always pushing their views on other people. 

I'm just saying, don't be a dick."
15168,I got the shot when I was 26-27. Was totally worth it. 
15169,"I asked my gynecologist about the shots, and she was saying that they can give the shots to older people, but they have to pay out of pocket (I'm in the U.S.), because it hasn't been tested on older age groups.  She did say that it might become available in a few years, and told me I might as well wait if I hadn't ever presented symptoms and I don't currently have more than one partner."
15170,"I know I'm way late on this thread, but I just wanted to thank you for posting this.

I'm exactly your age and more or less your same position (swinger instead of poly) and I had some trouble getting answers on Gardasil from one doctor I went to. She didn't seem too interested in helping me and she couldn't answer why the age limit, answering just ""That's just the way it is!""

I had to do my own research and found out that the age limit seems to be based on a few things:

1) Insurance won't cover it for older people, because...

2) ...it was tested on adolescents and those in their 20s...

3) ...for the express purpose of reducing the societal impact of HPV.

In other words, they don't ""care"" about individual cases of HPV. The goal is to reduce the incidence of HPV on a societal level by innoculating those most likely to catch and spread it before they've caught it.

Anyway, I came across your post as I was doing some last minute checking to see if there was anythign that might make me change my mind about getting the vaccine. But having read your experience, I found a doctor who will do this for me and I'm off to get the first round tomorrow. :)

Thanks again!"
15171,"Gardasil only protects against 4 strains of HPV. There are I believe around 60 types of HPV. It is one of the most common STI's among men and women. Most people will get at least 1 strain in their lifetime, although they may never know it. My wife had the vaccine when she was a teenager before she was sexually active and she has been diagnosed with HPV (one of the strains not covered by the vaccine) and has had 2 cervical cancer scares.

Also, the vaccine has been known to cause localized paralysis in some people. After the 1st or 2nd shot they begin to show signs of paralysis. 

Just do your research and know it is right for you. And well, always use condoms. "
15172,"It isn't. I had a g/f that had vaginal dryness issues for over a year. She went to several doctors including PP and every time they said that I was cheating on her and gave her something despite the fact that she had the problem for over a year and had more then 3 sti tests done. 

Turns out it was a side effect of the birth control which we found out about at a very amazing and sex-positive woman focused sex shop in a pamphlet they had out."
15173,"First of all, there are over a hundred strains of HPV, not all of them as dangerous as the ones the vaccine protects against.

Secondly, the vaccine does help prevent against *new* infections, so even if it turns out I have one type, it would help protect against the other types.

Thirdly, the phrase ""might be useless"" is pedantically equivalent to saying ""might be effective"", to which I refer to the part about bulletproof vests."
15174,"> and there is no test for overall HPV presence

Wrong.  DNA assays for HPV types have been around for awhile and was recently approved by the FDA for cervical cancer screening.  It's just not cost effective or of diagnostic value in all cases.

http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm394773.htm"
15175,It's not very new--it's been tested in humans for at least ten years at this point. There is a newer version coming out with twice as many statins covered soon. It's recently hit the newsstands which means it's been through testing as well.
15176,"> I guess if it's not too decrepit for the partners it'll do for the vaccine, too.

I like your attitude. I'm 24 and seeing someone 44. I'm vaccinated, but if I were unable to be for whatever reason, I'd want my partner to show that kind of consideration. If you're protected, then it protects those close to you, and that's awesome!"

15183,"Research done.

> Also, the vaccine has been known to cause localized paralysis in some people. After the 1st or 2nd shot they begin to show signs of paralysis.

Wrong.  In the [Postlicensure safety study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19690307) there was per dose a 0.0002% chance correlation for Guillain-Barré syndrome, a 0.00004% chance correlation for transverse myelitis, and a 0.000009% chance for motor neuron disease.  These chances are lower than an average population chance and is almost certainly just background noise.  Correlation does not equal causation."
15184,Your point was addressed in my original post.
15185,">First of all, there are over a hundred strains of HPV, not all of them as dangerous as the ones the vaccine protects against.

Only around 40 of them are sexually transmitted and the ones the vaccine protects against are by far the most common as you yourself mentioned.

As for the rest, I agree. I got vaccinated after I already developed symptoms. But it is still important, when spreading awareness about HPV and Gardasil to include that information.  "
15186,"Yeah, I forgot a word. There is no COMMERCIALLY available test for overall HPV presence. There are plenty of things that can be done in research settings but are not available to the public. "
15187,You're fucking welcome!
15188,care to elaborate why?
15189,"Also not entirely correct.  Quest Diagnostics, the biggest name in lab testing, [offers this exact assay](http://www.questdiagnostics.com/home/patients/tests-a-z/hpv.html) for the general public.

It's just not universal practice for a physician to order such a test because as I previously stated, the results are not always diagnostically relevant.  Or you could have a physician who graduated medical school 30 years ago and doesn't understand this is an option."
15190,LOL
15191,"Because the ""views"" they push are based on pseudoscience, fantasy and bullshit, and the ""views"" those of us in the reality-based community are not views, but facts.

They can scream all they want about Santa Claus being real, and we can call them idiots for believing in it.  We are infinitely better because we are correct, and they are wrong regardless of how politely or otherwise they push their message.

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Tone_argument"
15192,"Oh, no. I meant OVERALL. For both genders. Not cervical. A test that would tell whether someone has been infected with HPV and what type. In their mouth, throat, penis, anus or the skin of the external genitals. There is no such test available in everyday healthcare. "
15193,"you might be right, but isn't it better to show them how to find the information to gain the knowledge? rather than try to shove it down their throats? 

and by the way, i do believe that Santa was a real person. and he delivered toys to children. "
15194,"Again.  Also not entirely correct.  The assay in question works like this.  The medical practitioner swabs an area of the body of either gender.  This could be the cervix, mouth, throat, penis, anus, etc.  The swab is then sent to the lab for DNA extraction and amplification.  Depending on the exact test ordered, it can either confirm the general presence of any number of high risk types (The Hybrid Capture assay detects high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68), or it can specifically confirm Type 16 and/or 18.

The issue is not whether these tests are available.  The issue is how and why a physician would order this.  Some don't because they're old and stodgy.  Some don't because it's of no diagnostic value in a particular case.  Some don't because you or your insurance won't pay for it."
15195,"Antivaxxers are not reasonable.  If you show them the right information, they will claim it is false, or lies created by Big Pharma or some other conspiracy theory.

If they could be reasoned with, they wouldn't be antivaxxers."
15196,"OK. How would you implement this in practice so it is available to the general public? Given that HPV can be embedded in the top layers of the skin and localized, not showing symptoms. With mucous membranes, I guess it would be very expensive and time consuming but possible. Swabbing them inch by inch and sending all the samples for analysis. But with the external genitals? Would you seriously start scraping every inch of them? Come on. As I said, the technology exists but it doesn't mean it can be implemented in everyday healthcare. 

"
15197,"so why do you try to argue with some one that is completely unreasonable? 

i suppose i could ask myself the same thing.  "
15198,"It's not as onerous as you make it out to be.  But I agree these kinds of tests are best spent on high risk populations.  For instance, there's been great talk in the medical community about increasing anal screening of ""men who have sex with men"" through paps and this HPV DNA test.  "
15199,"Who's arguing?  I told anyone who was an antivaxxer to fuck off, not to present their point of view.

You're distracting from the point anyway.  Go away."
15200,"I honestly don't know why PAP smears are not routine for anal screening and possibly even that of the mouth, throat and urethra. But I really can't imagine how could testing externally be less onerous. Care to explain?"
15201,"If you're a virgin, you should probably get the vaccine. Yes, you might have to pay out of your own pocket. But for the chance of not getting penile or oral cancer? I'd take it. "
15202,"The only reason it's recommended for people under 26 is because the clinical trials were conducted in women age 26 and under. My gynecologist told me that even though I'm over 26, she still recommends it because I've had 3 partners - this seems like a low number to me, but it's apparently the threshold number of partners for increased risk of HPV regardless of age. It can't hurt to get the vaccine, especially if you might be sleeping with younger women who are statistically more likely to have HPV."
15203,"There are two HPV vaccines that are common. Guardasil protects against the four most likely to cause cancer. The other protects against two. The reason it is recommended for younger people is because if you've already been exposed to those strains, it's ineffective and you've wasted your money on those vaccines. HPV has hundreds of strains and is about as common as the common cold. If you have not been active yet, it will help you. The reason it's recommended to girls is a ""bang for your buck"" argument - cervical cancer related to HPV is more common than penile or anal or throat cancer related to it. However, if you're willing to spend the cash, you won't harm yourself. It's just that at a population level you'd spend more money vaccinating everybody than you would save on the extra cancer cases that you prevented. Individually, up to you bro. "
15204,"Here's a link to the current SOGC guidelines.  Chapter 8 is the most relevant to this discussion:

15205,"I'm a 28 year old male in Australia and didn't have any issues getting a prescription for Gardasil. Just be aware that I found health insurance wouldn't cover it and it's about $140 per dose (3 total required). 

My doctor ran through the side affects and there didn't seem to be anything more than the possibility of a headache or temporary pain at the injection site."
15206,"If I missed my chance to get this vaccine because I didn't hear about it at the right age (my mother [immigrant] was always in the room, the doctor obviously understood it was inappropriate to talk about this topic in front of her and about a disabled child to boot). 

How much would it cost. Around $120? or closer to $2000 plus the cost of the visit? I'm much older than OP. "
15207,"Absolutely ask your Dr about getting it. You're a prime candidate, there are extremely low possible side effects, and the benefits are huge. I was also almost 30 before I had sexual contact, and I got the Guardasil series (even though technically I was a little old). It greatly reduces your risk of genetal warts, throat/neck/anal/cervical cancer, and greatly reduces the liklihood you will be a HPV carrier for future partners. 

If your insurance won't cover it, see if Planned Parenthood has a discount offer or payment plan. Even without discounts, it's way cheaper to pay $300 (or even $500) now than to have to deal with warts or cancer later."
15208,"I'm 99% sure you can't get it if you're over 26, but check with a doctor first. Can't hurt getting it, that's for sure. "
15209,"I contemplated getting it when I was like 24, then I saw all the possible consequences of it and decided against it."
15210,"Good luck convincing the doctors to prescribe it.

>The HPV vaccine's safety and effectiveness have not yet been studied in adults older than age 26. Until that information is available, the HPV vaccine is not recommended for adults older than age 26.

>Why is HPV vaccination only recommended for women through age 26?

>HPV vaccination is not currently recommended for women over age 26 years. Clinical trials showed that, overall, HPV vaccination offered women limited or no protection against HPV-related diseases. For women over age 26 years, the best way to prevent cervical cancer is to get routine cervical cancer screening, as recommended.

http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-vaccine-young-women.htm"
15211,Just thought I'd mention that the 3 partners logic is not good logic - the vaccine does NOTHING if you've been exposed to those particular strains.  All it does is prevent you from contracting those particular strains in the future.
15212,"Three partners seems low, except that HPV is crazy common.  Tons of people carry it without knowing since many of the strains (including several that the vaccine covers) rarely cause any symptoms.  Three partners isn't a guarantee that you've got it, but it is significantly less cost effective to give the vaccine to people with more than that because for many of them it will be pointless."
15213,It depends on the country as to if it is covered for men or not. 
15214,"Certain insurance policies won't cover it for men, or for women over 26, etc.  You certainly can get it if you pay for it yourself, however."
15215,"Uhm what sources stating which consequences exactly? Gardasil has proven to be extremely safe and it has been given to millions of individuals.

OP should most def get the vaccine. Don't know if Gardasil 9 is out in the US yet, in that case perhaps there's a price drop on the old Gardasil version (that still protects against the strains that cause 70% of cervical cancer cases, and more specifically against HPV 16, which is arguable the most problematic strain when it comes to male cancer risk). "
15216,"I haven't heard of any cases of doctors refusing to vaccinate, especially after people said they didn't care if they had to pay out of pocket. "
15217,"If your doctor won't prescribe it, change doctors and find one who's more open minded. It can be tricky in conservative areas, unfortunately :("
15218,"That's absolutely true, but I think her point was that, statistically, your chances of being exposed to a large number of strains increases after the third partner. Medical statistics aren't always logical, they just depend on the trials that were done and the parameters that were looked at."
15219,"I would be shocked if any insurance covers it, given his demographic. "
15220,It happened to me a few years ago when I was a couple of months over the previous age limit.
15221,"That's why it's our job to make sense of what the trials actually are telling us - I think it's great you got the vaccine, I'm just saying the theoretical benefit is much higher before you even had the first partner, since the vaccine only prevents, it doesn't eliminate a virus that's already there :)"
15222,"Sexual virgin? That's the exact demographic the vaccine works for.      
      
FWIW, I've seen insurance cover it for males that were over 25."
15223,You told them you were a virgin and willing to pay out of pocket? 
15224,"Where have you seen it covered for males over that age? I'm well aware that it's great for virgins, the more secure contact you've had, the less point that there is in getting it. In Canada only girls are covered, and I was thinking most insurance plans would be equally stingy. I wasn't saying the vaccine wouldn't work for him, I was saying that I'd be very surprised if he could get it for free. "
15225,"No I didn't therefore my comment is completely irrelevant.

I asked for a vaccine and they said no.  It wasn't a discussion, it wasn't a debate they unequivocally said no, and then they gave me dirty looks when I asked for an STD test cause I am married (there are medically necessary reasons to ask for this test outside of personal safety in plural relationships).

What I am saying is good luck convincing the doctor you are not lying when you say whatever you are going to say.

So all in all it was a pleasant experience."
15226,"In the USA.        
        
I don't know Canada's rationale, but in the US, young men are vaccinated. Herd effect. "
15227,"If they are giving you dirty looks when you ask for medical care, I'd look for a new doctor, personally. "
15228,"The rationale is an economic one because the primary benefit is preventing cervical cancer, while the penile and anal cancers are less often caused by HPV. So much less likely that it's cheaper to treat those cancers when they arrive than actively prevent them by vaccinating everybody. What insurances cover the men in the states? I'd find it hard to believe that the lower end insurance plans cover it. Also, herd immunity refers to eliminating a virus in a population so that even those who are unvaccinated are safe. These vaccines haven't come close to that, so herd immunity is not a thing with regards to HPV until there is much better compliance with the vaccine. "

15232,"As someone who went to a doctor and already been diagnosed. I really don't know what else a Dermatologist could tell me. I'm not too worried about the cancer part of it anyways. I am concerned with getting rid of the warts and keeping outbreaks to a minimum while doing my best to ""clear"" the virus (Yes I know it can't be ""cured"", etc etc)"
15233,There are literally hundreds of strains of hpv. I think maybe two of them cause warts. Are you sure she had the warty kind? 
15234,"Yeah, you have at least one strain.

15235,"So, is this information I need to be sharing with any future female partners?

Hey, thanks for sharing internet person, from my quick review of your comments, it looks like you you know what your talking about."
15236,"There are not test for HPV, there is a user like 5 days ago saying that a chinese company is doing some test if you send them some blood samples, that sounds so fake.

I think it's not worth to say that you have any strain on your body, if you see a wart, please go to a dermatologist and follow his/her advice."
15237,So a dermatologist would be the most knowledgeable when it comes to transmission?
15238,Transmission?
15239,"Meaning, are dermatologists the subject-matter experts, when it come to HPV knowledge??"
15240,"I'm not sure, but they are the experts for warts removals."
15241,"Why not? 

It's safe, cheap or free, and it's always good to be vaccinated in case you *do* have sex."
15242,A sad reality is that not all sex is consensual.
15243,"There's no reason not to. It's mandatory to attend most colleges in the US, and while you may not be sexually active now, there's a chance that might change in the future. I don't know you, but there are plenty of aces (especially on the demi- scale) that will engage in sex for the sake of their significant other, and if you're in that position, you don't want to regret not getting your vaccines now just because you aren't sexually active at this exact moment."
15244,"I got it, but that's because it's required if you're a university student. I thought getting the shot was a bit silly since I am sex-repulsed, but I completely understand making it a requirement and fighting it would be even more silly."
15245,"I got the vaccine and would encourage the general population, including the asexual population, to get it as well. Sure, I'm low-risk and may never have sex at all, but this is just one of *many* vaccines I'll gladly get to protect against an unlikely, but possible, ailment.

Fun fact: Someone once said I was as bad as an anti-vaxxer because I didn't get a pap smear, which I found pretty funny because I have had the very vaccine that is relevant to what pap smears detect."
15246,"It's a treatment, with almost no side effects, that makes you largely immune to a bad disease.
 
What's the down side?"
15247,"Almost 22, never gotten the vaccine myself because I don't go to doctors for years on end. (don't like them, don't want anything to do with them) I believe the last time I went to the doctor for a mandated high school physical, the shot was relatively new... and I declined at that point just because I didn't want a shot.

If I go back to the doctor before the age you age out of the vaccine, maybe. But I doubt I will be back within the next 5 years or so.

Not opposed to the vaccine by any means, everyone should get it. "
15248,"I got it.  I'm a virgin at 32, but heck, anything could happen and why not be protected against HPV?"
15249,"I'm 21 and don't really plan on having sex, ever, but I got it because why not?"
15250,I got it when I was 16. There is no reason not to get it.
15251,I didn't get it
15252,"Well, you never know what's going to happen in your future, and I'm pretty sure there are some cases of HPV that have nothing to do with sex - after all, it can cause warts on your feet or hands or whatever. Better safe than sorry. This is coming from someone who is very, very, VERY asexual, so, yeah, there ya' go."
15253,"Are there other ways to contract HPV other than sexual contact? If so, it would be a good idea to take the vaccine."
15254,It's a good idea - better safe than sorry and all that. 
15255,"Sorry for the late response just came across this sub and kind of surfing through it. iIRC males are mostly carriers and women are the most risk, doctors don't know who you are and what may happen in the future. If those shots can help prevent cervical cancer amoung other girls down the line for the girls while having little effect on you defintitely do it."
15256,"Wow it's cheap now? I never got it because it came out when I was 21 and it was like $200+. I know you could get it later then that, but I just never did and now I'm 27."
15257,Right.  That's one thing.
15258,"I had no idea that it was mandatory at most US schools.  At mine,  if you did not have the vaccine, you sign a form saying you understand the risks."
15259,huh.. It isn't a requirement for my university.  If you don't have it yet you must sign a form saying you understand the risks.  
15260,"You can still get cancer, the vaccine doesn't protect against all strains."
15261,:( that fact wasn't fun at all
15262,"Right.  Just.. fuck it, why not?"
15263,I don't know.  Maybe if someone has bad hygiene and touches their junk?
15264,"Yeah, I wasn't buying this for a hot minute so I looked it up. It's not. See:

http://www.immunize.org/laws/hpv.asp

And that's for secondary school...not university level. HPV is an STD and although college campuses would love not to have high STD rates, it's going to be tough to make this type of vaccine an absolute mandate to enter university.

"
15265,"True, but someone who has never been sexually active, is under the age of 30, has no symptoms indicative of cervical cancer and no family history of cervical cancer is *spectacularly unlikely* to have developed cervical cancer. So my doctor and I made a decision not to do a pap smear for the time being."
15266,You're fine.
15267,You can get both.  Just space them out by a few days. Just make sure that you're well when you go get these vaccines.  Cold symptoms a few days after the vaccines is normal.
15268,They don't need to be spaced out at all. OP could get them at the exact time if he wanted.
15269,I didn't say they have to be. I know they can be done at one time. Just a suggestion because the HPV shot hurts like hell.
15270,but then you have to go back to the clinic twice :/ Might as well just get both in the same arm at once 
15271,"TL;DR - Don't worry about it

First of all, that's very considerate of you to think of this while you're dealing with a stressful medical situation of your own.  That said, there's very little point in telling your past partners.  The vast majority of HPV infections never cause symptoms and clear without causing any damage, so the person you got it from (and anybody who might have caught it from you) likely never even noticed.

Regarding point #6, anybody can get a blood test for HPV, but that can't tell you if the infection led to any sort of cancer, which is the point of a pap smear.  The good news is that it's much more rare for straight men to have complications from HPV."
15272,"> Regarding point #6, anybody can get a blood test for HPV

There is no such test. At least not one reliable enough to be approved by any western country. "
15273,"Firsr of all, you don't NEED to get. You can if you want to though. The vaccine reaches its full effect after the third shot, that is six months after the first one. Make sure it's the new version, the nanovalent."
15274,"A few years ago they ran out and couldn't provide it to everyone who wanted it. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it, but they refused to give it to anyone who wasn't in the highest risk group. Maybe that line of thinking has just transferred over to the insurance coverage as well."
15275,"I'm in the same situation, but rather than my insurance provider, it's my government. Australia's (universal) Medicare only covers it for women. Very annoying."
15276,"The reason HPV vaccines are generally only given to women is because it greatly increases the risk of cervical cancer. The cancerous effects on men aren't nearly so prevalent.

http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/hpv-virus-men

Since HPV is spread through sexual contact if every woman has had the vaccine then it's likely that you won't get it anyway. Although I'm not sure how the vaccination programmes work in your country. In Britain the majority of teenage girls are given the vaccine."
15277,"Wow, I thought most insurance companies provided coverage for the HPV vaccine up to age 26. That's pretty bogus."
15278,"> I want to be protected, so I’ll pay the $230 out of pocket for the shot. I just thought that with all the money I pay for insurance, they could afford to give me some of the preventive care they promised.

Insurance companies are only going to pay for preventative care that will save them money. Your chances of getting a serious illness from HPV are low enough that treating those illnesses will be cheaper than giving men the vaccine. Number of lives saved never appears on their balance books.

"
15279,That sucks man. I'm lucky that my insurance covered it.
15280,"I'm going off wikipedia here, so if anyone has any better info, please correct me.

Depending on your age, one reason your insurance won't cover it might be that the FDA hasn't approved it - they've only OK gardasil for males aged 9 to 26.

So if you're 27 or older, you'd probably be shit out of luck no matter which insurance company you have - most likely *none* of them would pay for a vaccine that hasn't been OK'ed by the FDA."
15281,My insurance covers a lot of stuff for women but not men. It's shit.

As far as I'm aware, (according to my doctor friend) the vaccine isn't dangerous or ineffective for older people; rather, it's less cost-effective.

15331,This is clearly a job for professional therapy in my opinion.
15332,"I think maybe you both need to visit a doctor and get educated on HPV.

HPV is incredibly common.  About 80% of the population carries it.  In most cases, it does nothing.

If she was sexually active before meeting you, it is absolutely possible that she contracted it from a prior partner.

Also, the primary health endpoint in women with HPV is cervical cancer, not uterine cancer.  Maybe what you meant to say is she had a pap test and the results came back as dysplasia or some other pre-cancerous term.  If that's the case, again, it's incredibly common.  

In my opinion, her response is analogous to never eating again after getting food poisoning.  A complete and detrimental overreaction to a common infection that most likely won't do anything significant."
15333,">...in over a year.  Will this ever get better?

Probably not unless you guys see a counselor.  She appears to be blaming you for the situation (silently) despite you being completely upfront with her."
15334,"This is already broken. 

No sex in a year. The top contenders (in terms of an explanation) are the following: 

1. Her sex drive crashed: Nope, she's recoiling from your touch so this isn't a case of no interest, it's a case of disgust. 
2. Specific need isn't being met: Nope, you've pretty much tried everything from the sounds of it and there's nothing here to suggest a hidden kink or some unspoken desire. 
3. Birth control: nope. you'd have noticed a stranger timeline for the drop off
4. Communication: a whole year is pretty much enough to rule that one out. 

That only leaves the worst answer here which is this one: trauma. Not the kind of trauma that is, for lack of a better term, ""the good kind"". She isn't being haunted by her past, she's being haunted by you. And its as unfair as all get out. 

You feel guilty. You shouldn't. You did EVERYTHING RIGHT. And you're both full of shit if you think you can safely say that you gave her HPV. First of all, HPV is pretty much at the top of the list for common STDs. It is also symptom-less in most cases. Unless I am mistaken on the time line, she could have had it long before she met you. Maybe she did get it from you, but you were basically good guy Greg on this one. You said and did everything a responsible partner should do. She heard you out, took the risk, and she got burned and for that I am very sorry. But a mature, sexually active adult gets to make her own decisions and live with the consequences and blaming you is offensive and wrong. 

She isn't getting over it. She doesn't even seem like she WANTS to get over it. If she was coming to you and saying, ""Honey, I know we have this problem but I wan to take baby steps and work through it"" that'd be one thing. She isn't even willing to admit how angry she is with you. And it is not your fault. It is her responsibility to manage her own risk/reward behavior and you did EVERYTHING right. And now, you need to do the next right thing and that is to leave her. 

She needs to start over with someone she is not holding hostage by way of guilt and sex. She needs to take control over her life and her sex drive and make decisions. You sitting here and letting her wallow and punish is radically unhealthy for both of you. I can't imagine how bad you feel but you need to make a distinction between real guilt and the kind of unavoidable guilt that comes long with doing the right thing. You couldn't have been a better guy. You can feel bad that it happened, but you should feel nothing but pride for how you've reacted. You've given her time, you've been patient, and now you need to do the thing that she won't do for herself. She loves you, but she doesn't see your penis as anything other than toxic and she's too much of a pussy to admit it. 

You are prolonging the inevitable. I think you're doing it both for her and your own guilt. What the next step entails is the guilt of knowing that she isn't dealing with the issue in front of her nose and that she's wasting both of your time. I assume you both want a life partner, a family, a close intimate sexual relationship in the long term. The longer you two pretend that this is a functional, long-term situation the longer you postpone getting what you really want and deserve. 

Just to clarify, you have this line that just kills me: 

>She's totally cold to the idea of sex, and, understandably, the entire experience is framed negatively by HPV

**No**. That is not understandable to me. That is not okay. That is not excusable behavior because something bad happened to her. You didn't ask to get HPV. You probably weren't given the option to avoid the risk before you contracted it. She had the best information and risk/reward statistics possible and she cards fell badly. I am sorry for her about that, it really sucks. It might have significant health consequences and that *really* sucks. But none of that excuses treating the good guy, the guy that tried to give you the best shot at avoiding it possible, like he's an afterthought. That's not an excuse to freeze out your partner and your lover. You can ask for time, you can ask for support, but you cannot ask someone to let their guilt and an occasional blowjob tide them over while you decide whether sex with them is an option for you ever again. That's cruel and it demonstrates a lack of maturity and a lack of self-awareness. I know you want to paint her that the one who was done wrong and she was...by fate. The universe did her wrong, you did nothing but the right thing. And if she is unwilling and unable to make that distinction, then she needs to let you move on to someone who looks at your better tendencies and sees a sweet, health-conscious guy and revels in a sex life with you. You deserve at least that. Her behavior may be understandable, but it is still unacceptable. 

Sorry for the bad news, kid. Best of luck. "
15335,"HPV is pretty minor as far as STDs go. Something like 80% of the population has it and the CDC advises that you should assume you have it if you've had sex with more than one person. It's asymptomatic in most people.

That said, there's a real problem here if it's been a year and a half and it's still too fresh for her to even talk with you about. You should seek couples counseling."
15336,This isn't something you can fix for her. She probably can't even fix it herself. She really needs professional help to cope with this internalized trauma and to learn to dissociate sex from her fear.
15337,"Life is short.  Really short.  You could get hit by a bus or get into a car accident tomorrow. You should do whatever you need to do to maximize your happiness during this life, and it sounds to me like breaking it off with this girl would help you achieve that. 

Sure no sex sucks, but it's more than that dude, it's the feeling of being loved, of being wanted, that you really want, and what you deserve."
15338,"It won't get better, especially if you're not discussing it openly with her.

You've done all these grand gestures, and yet she still doesn't feel physically attracted to you any more. I imagine that she feels almost betrayed; although she consented after you told her, she still contracted HPV, so is probably chastising herself for ""ruining"" herself for any future partners. The problem with lack of sex in a relationship, is that the longer it goes on, the easier it gets to not have sex. It just becomes the accepted norm. You need to challenge the norm, and the only way you're going to be able to do that (in my opinion) is to openly discuss how she feels about it. Maybe she's feeling incredibly insecure, as if you leave her at some point in the future, who would want her then?

Talk to her about how you're worried about her, and ask her how she feels about the lack of sex, and where she thinks it originates from. It's going to end in a dark place for both of you unfortunately, but if you come out of it together, then you'll be all the stronger for it. Good luck."
15339,"My room mate has hpv and developed precancerous cells, she told me it hurts to have sex because her cervix is hella sensitive.

She is probably disgusted with herself for not wanting to have sex with you, shes conflicted because it hurts/she could be hella scared. When getting a LEEP done the possiblity of being infertile and your cervix flipping out is raised a lot because your taking a LAZER TO YOUR CERVIX o__o"

A lot of females pap tests will come back abnormal and doctors will suspect HPV.  Your post isn't too clear, but it seems the doctors have done nothing with the pre-cancerous cells.  And without further testing and procedures done, she really could just be upset about nothing.  If she hasn't done a LEEP yet (or whatever the doctor recommends), she needs to have her cells tested.  Also, there are different forms of HPV and she could have one of the types that is not an STD.

15343,"It might get better, it's totally based on mental well-being at this point.

Was she aware of the risk that the vaccine only guards against the most common HPV viruses and there was a somewhat reasonable chance she would contract the less common viruses? Because the risk was still high, just not AS high. You did your part, you were honest, you gave her a choice, and she took the risk.

Men and women carry the virus for up to three years is what I was told by my OBGYN.

Full disclosure...I had HPV. Even though I was in two separate, long-term and monogomous relationships at the time I contracted it (there was no overlap, I just couldn't pinpoint within a 6 month period I got it. I made both men aware that I likely got it from one of them, and so they have it, but I did not blame whoever it was because there were no symptoms for either of them, they needed to be aware though. In any event, I got cancer from it. Started out as precancerous tumors and then spread a little but I had an aggressive campaign to fight them (and good health insurance).

I got a procedure (ranging from cutting out, freezing out, zapping them with radiation...whatever, a full range of progressively aggressive procedures) every other month, sometimes every month! It was awful. I got a lot of my lady bits scraped out of me, my next step honestly, was to have a hysterectomy....which I am still thinking about but I have been cancer free for more than a year now.

During that time, the year all that went on, I did not have much sex. It's not that it hurt (sometimes it did) but that I just felt icky. Thinking about sex made me feel sick to my stomach, it made me think of all the scraping and cutting and cold metal in my vagina... It took a lot of time, at LEAST a year to get a libido back. And I did not blame or have any ill will towards my boyfriend... So if your girlfriend harbors any resentment towards you, that will only add to the time it takes to get over that sideline of ickyness. It's still an STD too, that idea alone can make someone not feel so sexy.

Encourage her to be aggressive with treatment and then when she is in the clear for a while, then she hopefully will be able to get over the traumatic procedures.

EDIT: also, in addition to painful and numerous procedures, birth control destroyed my libido. When I became cancer-free, I also stopped taking the birth control pills and switched to a hormone-free IUD and I discovered a sex drive I never even knew about. So there's that."
15344,"this is weird to me.  I have HPV, have had it for about 5 years now.  I also got Guardasil.. I have had laser surgery (2 yrs ago) on the cancerous cells and get check ups every 6 months.  everything is fine, and this is SO COMMON it's ridiculous.  my boyfriend or me RARELY even talk or think about it unless it's checkup time.. if you take care of your body this is not a big deal. "
15345,"I was in a sexless relationship for 3 years and just recently left it. (4 years  all together, 3 years without)
I couldn't be happier to be out of that relationship because I felt unloved, unattractive and unwanted.

And, funny enough, now she's with some other guy, apparently banging his brains out (Was probably cheating on me, but whatever).

So yeah..."
15346,"Couples counseling now. If she refuses, break up with her."
15347,"they need to write a book for dudes like you.  The book is called ""So you have a female roomie"""
15348,"Hey, so the same thing happened to me. I got a call from my gyno saying I needed to come in ASAP, he sounded so scared. I about pooped my pants. Anyways, after they did the colposcopy, I just talked to him. And we honestly weren't 100 percent sure if he gave it to me or maybe I had gotten it from someone else. However, I love the shit out of my SO and I just got over it. I'm not saying your gf doesn't love you, but I don't know how she can't be over it by now. The fact that you were honest about this from the beginning and have stayed with her through her flipping out, and basically being disgusted by you....I don't know. I agree she needs to do therapy with you. :/"
15349,This problem is an iceberg...Where else in the relationship does her extreme passive behavior show up. Look closely cause it has to be there.
15350,"Have you tried talking to her about the anxiety and perhaps get relationship counseling with her together? Sometimes people place a taboo on professional therapy. Think of it this way, when you get sick physically, you go see a doctor. Same thing with emotional sickness. When you get depressed or have unreasonable fears, it is appropriate to find a therapist to help.

Getting cancerous cell in the uterus is pretty scary thing. Maybe she is worried about having sex might active them or something. Could be lack of education/understanding about the problem. If she is giving you oral then that means she still wants to please you and loves you.

So, please go seek professional help, it will help a lot to just talk it out instead of pushing her and giving her ultimatums. "
15351,See a professional.  
15352,"I think everyone here pretty much said what I was going to.  All I have to say is good luck buddy, hope it works out.  And I guess I'll repeat that you have to keep in mind what's going to make you happy in the long run."
15353,Its over.
15354,"JSYK, the HPV 'vaccine' only protects against four strains of HPV. There are over 100 strains in existence. The four strains covered by the vaccine are only a few that can lead to cervical cancer...so she wasn't really protected on either of those fronts to begin with, and if that's what's bugging her, you both should have done some more research."
15355,"> Will this ever get better?

Probably not, is this how you want to spend the rest of your life ?"
15356,Hypothesis: maybe she's unable to have children now and hasn't told you. This could be why she feels so traumatized
15357,"
Gone through a similar situation myself, I ca. Say that the lack of sex has little to do with you, personally. STDs can cause link sex to being negative and repulsive. Ever try to get hard while watching someone eat their own throwup? Similar effect. She needs therapy, particularly from a sex therapist, who can guide her to loving her sexual side that she is currently resenting. You can't love another until you love yourself. You can love yourself until you accept yourself. She needs to understand she's the same person as ever. Therapy is key"
15358,"HPV is so tricky. She could've actually had it before coming in contact with you and not known about it. Not all strains have symptoms and that could've happened. My manager developed cervical cancer before she finished the series of shots.

Your gf doesn't seem to be informed on HPV and she is getting mad at you for something she knew you had. You warned her and she was ok with it. She could also be mad at herself and not want the constant reminder of it. The thing is she should really read up on HPV. HPV can be contracted between people that haven't had sex at all, or even despite using condoms. All you need is skin to skin contact. It's sneaky, but for the most part a very minor thing. Hell the CDC was even saying just having frequent sex can lead to development of precancerous cells and HPV.

Get therapy. I'm suspecting she didn't break up with you because she feels like she's damaged goods and will never be able to have another partner after you. Now she feels trapped with you and may resent you for that.

Have her educate herself and maybe even look for a therapist that specializes in therapy with STDs. [HPV transmission](http://www.hpvtransmission.org/) [HPV transmission 2](http://www.buzzle.com/articles/hpv-transmission-facts.html)"
15359,"after ten years of marriage & the now ongoing divorce I can assure you that NO, it does NOT get better. Move on your wasting your time; the next one will be the best EVER! "
15360,"I am going through close to this, im 24 years old and  i got the gardisil shot about 7 years ago, so it is  more than in my system . My boyfriend and i have been dating for about 4 years and we moved in and i got hpv from him. Ive never been with anyone else so we knew it was him.

 I am in school for nursing so i have been able to have resoruces that have educated me about it. There are so many different strands of HPV and gardisil protects against the 5-6 cancerous strains of hpv. 80 percent of people that are sexually active have had some strain of hpv at one point in their life. 90% of people start making antibodies against it and within 2 years and they  dont have any other worry about for the rest of their life. Yes it is scary yes you feel horrible with your self but unfortunately you cant go back in time. Hpv can lay dorment for years without showing symptoms so she could have gotten it before, and unfortunatly there is no way for a man to be checked to tell of he hss it, 

She needs to be going every 6 months to get a pap smear so they can tell if it has diminished.  Once it is gone you wont have to worry about it coming back. Im not saying you get rid of hpv, but your body starts making antibodies against the virus and you dont have to worry about it making any other cancerous cells in the cervix. That has been my main fear about getting rid of it and being sexual with my boyfriend and contracting hpv again. Dont need to worry about that either, you both have the same hpv strain, so if she has been making antibodies and her pap smears have been coming back clean and not showing hpv it means that she cannot get hpv from you or have another outbreak again. Its hard to over come that bump, but what has helped me is to educate yourself.  Dont go on google and believe everything you read, go together talk to the dpctor and voice your concerns. Im typing for my phone so i appoligize for spelling errors or formatting odd."
15361,"There are hundreds of strains of HPV - the Gardasil only guards against a few!
Did you know what kind you had? I mean, regardless, she's overreacting to this. Once she gets LEEP or cryo, her immune system should kick the virus, and her paps will be normal again. That's what happened to me!
Tell her to get on 2XC and talk to the 100s of women who've been through this. Certainly, she doesn't need to end your sex life (which she's already done) because she got a virus that 80% of people who are sexually active will get at some point.
Geez. What happens when she breaks a nail??
"
15362,"Has it occurred to either of you that she may have contracted HPV before you met her but was asymptomatic? 

It's incredibly common among sexually active college aged men and women. "
15363,"Dude, HPV is NOT that big a deal. I had it, precancerous cells and all. Cleared up. Boom. Still having sex. You should not be feeling guilty or responsible. She has issues."
15364,"A BJ with her can spread it to her mouth/throat. Don't do it. It's her health, and life you're playing with."
15365,"Short answer: No.

I didn't need the background.  After a year, you are both used to the idea and reality of not sleeping together.  Your relationship has moved on to being roommates.  Not to say that some therapy or couples counseling couldn't help, give it a shot if you care.  I'd ask her, sincerely, if she really wants to be with you or not.  "
15366,"You need to get three different HPV vaccines when you get them.  They are done at intervals - a few months after one another.  I think 6 months after the third and final vaccine, is she somewhat protected.

I say somewhat because the HPV vaccine doesn't prevent all strains of HPV.  You can still get HPV and you can still transfer HPV even after you've had the vaccine. Also, HPV can be transferred orally.

As others said, try couples counseling.  However it will be hard to save something like this due to all of the trauma. 

best of luck. "
15367,"nope, new girl.."
15368,"Ouch. It seems her opinion of you is already tainted with the concept of disease. Its hard to become attracted to someone who you know is in possession of a deadly virus. I'm afraid there is not much you can do personally. If she is unable to overcome this (for lack of a better term) disgust towards you, its probably best you go the hard route and move on with your life."
15369,Some estimates say that up to 80% of sexually active people carry some form of hpv. 
15370,Nope. 
15371,"HPV isn't the end of the world, it's just a virus and most young women clear it from their system over time. Even if she doesn't - just needs pap smears, like most."
15372,Of course it won't get better! You're absolutely just prolonging the inevitable. End it!
15373,"As a women, who had a relationship that was sexless for more then a year, I can sympathize with your situation (mine didn't involve a virus). My ex did drugs and cheated on me. Everyday I sat here and hated him for what he did to me, and my family. I resented him for everything, and I couldn't bring myself to even look at him some days. It seems to me she resents you for the virus you gave her, or for other reasons you've not listed in your post. You can't force the spark back into your relationship if it's gone. My ex could have bought me a bar of solid gold and it wouldn't have made a difference. I had lost respect, and trust for him. 

But it intrigues me that she knowingly took the risk of having unprotected sex with you, and is now shocked she has the same virus. HPV vaccinations aren't full proof, and the doctors should have said that to you guys. I'm sorry you guys weren't informed properly. 

Whatever happens I hope you make the right choices."

**No.**

**Yes.**
"
15375,One word answer: BAIL
15376,"Just one question - is she on birth control?  HPV aside, the situation you are describing happened to me, and it was from the birth control.  Stopped taking the birth control, mad sex. "
15377,nope
15378,LOL
15379,"I'm finding this extremely hard to believe since not only did you say uterus instead of cervix, the type of HPV that can cause cervical cancer is not detectable in men, and therefore there would be no way you could know you ""came away with a case of it."" "
15380,You gave me HPV.  Maybe HIV is next?
15381,"what the fuck is wrong with you people? You are mid 20s and haven't had sex with your gf in a YEAR? After a month I would be all like ""wow fuck this"""
15382,"I was thinking the same thing.  The OP isn't too clear on what has happened concerning the test results, and I'm suspect to believe that the GF has misunderstood her results.  "
15383,"yes, i meant cervical pre-cancerous, not uterus. my bad. i'm pretty well read on the disease. "
15384,"whew. well thanks for the good news/bad news. i think the part that most resonates here for me is that she's not actively trying to fix our sex life. i hadn't really considered that since i was sort of blinded by my own guilt about what's happened. 

i sort of figured this was the case. i guess this whole thread was just me asking a question that i knew the answer to but didn't like the answer."
15385,This is the best reply I've ever seen to anything ever. 100%
15386,"Man woman or beast, I do not care - I just want you to be mine. What a perfect response."
15387,"This is a completely unfair post. The fact that the girlfriend still gave blowjobs signals to me that this is not a conscious alienating act; it's one of discomfort with her own body. She doesn't want to have the kind of sex that gave her HPV and potential cancer. When you feel that your body, something sacred, has been corrupted by a certain act you may have difficulty separating the act itself from the consequences.

This is not her blaming or guilting her partner! More likely than not, this is a person dealing with a lot of internalized issues about sex and their own flawed body. How hard must it be to have sex and think about somebody interacting with parts of your body touched by cancer? I cannot even imagine trying to have sex while being aware the entire time that the equipment I'm working with is touched with disease.

I agree that she needs counseling. She needs to reclaim her body from the act that brought her HPV and learn to feel comfortable and happy again. Whether or not her choice to reject sex is ""inexcusable"" cannot be decided by somebody who has not went through the experience of having their body tainted like this.

OP, talk with her. Tell her that you miss being close to her and that you want to find a way through this. If she goes to speak to a professional I feel it will help her in more ways than just making sex approachable again. As you said, it was a traumatic experience, and it doesn't seem like she has yet taken control of that. Tell her you'll work through things with her, and that you support her entirely.

I really don't think she's blaming you. For some people, it's just hard to get past these things and again see the joy in an act which brought so much stress and concern."
15388,">It might have significant health consequences

Yea.. like... cancer.

>That is not excusable behavior because something bad happened to her

What are you talking about? Who are you to tell how this girl should react about her own issues?

It is an excuse good enough for her. Sorry if you would react in a different way, it's just too easy to judge when it's not you."
15389,"Wow, 1.2.3.4.5... science has eliminated Love from the equation!"
15390,"Excellent comment dude, keep it up!"
15391,"Yeah I thought this was kind of odd that such a common STD would incite such a negative response. 

Couples counseling, or sex ed?"
15392,"Yes, HPV is a pretty minor STD!  Yes she may have developed pre-cancer cells but she is not doomed!  She just has to get a LEEP procedure done and get regular screenings (which she should anyway).  

If your gf does resent you, I'm sorry dude-bro, but you have to move on.  This is a battle she has to fight and win for herself.  You should see your way out."
15393,My thoughts exactly. She sounds just straight up depressed to me.
15394,">it's the feeling of being loved, of being wanted, that you really want, and what you deserve.

Verily this.  It's time to spark some change. Start by talking openly, suggest some counseling.  If nothing changes, you have to think about moving on."
15395,"we have discussed it, though it tends to be a charged issued that ends in tears. she's said things to the effect of, ""It's too fresh, I'm still dealing with this, maybe later we can have sex, etc...""

And it has totally become the norm, not having sex. It just sucks because everything else works so well with us. I've come to that place where I sort of understand guys who love being with their wife but sleep with other women. I haven't done that, nor do i condone it, but I now see how people come to rationalize that behavior.

and yes, you're totally right that this will end in a ""dark place for both of"" us. just sucks though."
15396,she sees a gyno every 6 months. she's had part of her lady parts removed and biopsy done. 
15397,"sounds like you've been through a lot. unfortunately, my gf's not on birth control, and she seems to harbor some resentment toward me. i think she's gone from feeling ""icky"" to just feeling nothing. glad to hear you're cancer-free."
15398,">I also stopped taking the birth control pills and switched to a hormone-free IUD and I discovered a sex drive I never even knew about.

^ This.

Though some women run into complications with them, an IUD is an option not considered enough by women.  Experience with my partner (and hearing the experiences of other women) lead me to believe hormonal birth control is something best avoided if at all possible."
15399,">they need to write a book for dudes like you. The book is called **""So, you're married""**

There, fixed. :)


"
15400,i'm going to bring up couples counseling when i get home today. i know she's seen a therapist before so i don't think it's a taboo subject. i just hope she's open to the idea in this context.
15401,"thanks for the info. yes, she gets the pap smear every 6 months so she's on top of that. i think the question of re-infection was a real concern so i'll bring that up in my next ""in defense of sex"" conversation."
15402,"But you do know that a LEEP or cryo can leave a woman with infertility problems? :( She now has a virus that will infect any guy she will ever sleep with and could possibly have a problem having kids and although HPV can disappear for a while it can always come back 5, 10, 15 years down the road. "
15403,it has certainly occurred to me. i don't think we could prove anything one way or the other. 
15404,she's not on birth control. 
15405,"here we go. yes, i made all this up for the karma for my throwaway account. i meant cervix, not uterus. a girl in previous relationship gave me genital warts. last time i checked hpv causes those. what more do you want?"
15406,What the fuck is wrong with you? There's more to a relationship then sex. But you would know that if you ever had a meaningful relationship. 
15407,"i had this at my VERY FIRST pap smear and freaked out because everything online is like ""oh that's pre cancerous"" when in fact (especially in early-mid 20 yr olds) your body will clear it up within a year or so.  also, how did you know you even had HPV?? i was pissed at my ex cuz i thought he lied about getting a full std test at his school, but there is no male test for HPV (the only way you'd know is if you had the strain that causes warts which is prevented by the vaccine)... I too had the vaccine way before i ever had sex and still got it... does she get regular pap tests??  because my test the next year was totally normal after the initially abnormal one.
edit: also the reason you only need paps every few years is because it literally can take a decade for precancerous cells to become cervical cancer and usually they are totally eradicated... if it's been over a year she probably doesn't even have HPV anymore..."

15410,"I don't think he's invalidating her decisions, obviously anyone's decisions are valid in their own world. What he's saying is that her decisions are not at all in line with what is going to make our man up there happy. Therefore he does not need to stay in the relationship purely out of guilt with no actual return to himself.

It sounds selfish if you frame it the way you did, but relationships are give and take. And there is absolutely no giving from her here."
15411,[deleted]
15412,"Well I suggested couples counselling because there's more to it than just the STD issue. I would still recommend therapy even if the STD in question were something like herpes. He was up front about it, she took a calculated risk, and now she's spent a year and a half blowing off sex entirely? That's not healthy."
15413,"LEEP isn't even always necessary. I know a number of people who had squamous cells and the docs used the ""wait and see"" approach instead of lobbing off a chunk of cervix. It just depends on the grade the cells have gotten to. "
15414,Since you've already tried initiating these kinds of conversations I agree with the OP that recommend couples counseling - and possibly additional therapy for her. 18 months is a long time for her to still be so upset by what happened.
15415,"When you say lady parts what exactly do you mean? Are you talking about just the portion that contained the cells or something bigger?

This has the possibility of getting better, but she's going to need a lot of therapy. Her reaction to you could be the symptom of many different things going on in her head. She may be feeling ashamed, or dirty, or less womanly, or any combination of these and other things. This is the kind of thing that really fucks with your head, on top of just dealing with the health ramifications.

You have to decide if you're willing to stick with her *if she agrees to get help.* If she doesn't agree, or doesn't try when she does get the help I'm afraid there's not much more you can do to salvage this."
15416,"that is a reality some married men choose to put up with.   If we follow the conventional wisdom that sex will decrease after marriage, the OP will actually be in the realm of negative sex, which is a scary scary place to go."
15417,"Great. Btw, I read your reply to AyeAyeCaptain about how your gf had part of her lady parts removed but not sure what... this might be a big issue... and you need to communicate with her first before making any assumptions.

The top rated comments made some valid points but they are making a lot of assumptions - 1. she doesn't want to get help and 2. she blames you. They are only assumptions and may not be true. First of all, if she blames you, then why would she still give you oral? Why would she still want to please you sexually?! Secondly, why is people assuming she doesn't want to get help? It sounds more like she is AFRIAD to get help.

I read that many people with PTSD do not want to relive those horrible experiences. I think having one's private part examined and then parts of it removed would probably be freaking stressful. The reason why she is not having sex with you is probably she is afraid of reliving that experience and/or she is ashamed of herself because she is missing part of her sexual parts. I think a lot of what's going on has to do with fear, not anger.

"
15418,"She might also be having some depression or anxiety because of it, my doctor perscribed me lexapro and it has helped me think more clearly about the situation. and understand pointing fingers isnt going to help the situation, just let her know she needs to get her immune system up to fight the virus, you might be able to do a bonding health thing where you guys make a pack to eat healthier and exercise to bring you closer together. That is what helped my boyfriend and i immensly, we went hiking and i was slower and told him to go on ahead and i woukd just catch us, but he said he would be there for me no matter what. Im sure you said it to her many times before during this but sometimes putting those words in a different situation really make them click more."
15419,"No kids - sounds good to me.
And yes, I do know HPV goes dormant and can return - but it can also never return. 
I live with it!"
15420,"The kind of HPV that causes warts is different than the kind that can cause cancer. If this were true, your doctors would have told you things like that. "
15421,meaningful relationships involve sex. 
15422,There are a good 20% that are on here looking for the answer they want to hear and arguing vehemently with anyone who suggests different.
15423,"I haven't read the book but I must admit you mentioned something that has been on my mind since reading this thread...

OP, are you *sure* you gave her HPV? I mean I'm really sorry to actually name it but here are some interesting facts:

1. No sex for over a year
2. Occasional blowjob
3. She recoils at your efforts

it sounds to me like on the one hand she doesn't want *sex* with you and other other she doesn't want sex with *you*. A lot of my friends have had treatment for HPV and painful and traumatic as it is, within 3 months they were enjoying a healthy libido and good sex life again.

It sounds like your girlfriend is emotionally immature about sex, as the comments above indicate, but also that maybe it's more complicated than just HPV. Maybe the HPV was a result of sex with someone else; and yes, this could have been sexual assault that you don't know about, but also she could be seeing someone else.

Anyway, bottom line is you're not happy and sex is important to you in this relationship and you want it to be a part of your lives again. She needs to know that. The reasons behind her choices are her own but at the same time you are in this relationship too."
15424,"Exactly. Plus I would say it's still a fair bit selfish on her part. Since it's been an entire year and not only is she recoiling from his touch (I don't understand why you would stay in a relationship at that point, but that's just me), she isn't even willing to talk about it."
15425,HPV is a big deal for women.
15426,"Um. There are more than 4 strains of HPV that cause cancer. Yes, there are many strains of HPV, and yes, it is a very common virus and I agree that it is not a big deal in the majority of cases, but your information is wrong. We do not have a vaccine for every cancer causing strain. If the gynecologist told her she had pre-cancerous cells, I'm pretty sure she's not confusing a harmless strain of HPV with a cancer-causing one."
15427,This is true! Sometimes the cells go away on their own.
15428,"It also depends on the age of the person. Younger people are very likely to recover on their own without intervention. This is why many regions do not even recommend pap smears before age 18 or before age 21 - even if a person contracts HPV and develops pre-cancerous cells at an age younger than that, they're essentially guaranteed to clear them before they become a problem."
15429,"honestly i'm not sure what was removed. she's not really in a good mood when she gets back from the gyno and i'll admit i try to bring that up. 

""If she agrees to get help"" --are you talking about medical help for hpv or mental/emotional health therapy? or both? She's on top of the medical gyno part. "
15430,[deleted]
15431,"I know. One that doesn't have to hold true. A lack of sex in a marriage has a reason. For me it was PPD, that went away with therapy and (later) meds. "
15432,"i think you're politely insinuating that i'm somewhat oblivious to her plight and/or i'm not properly communicating with her. my understanding is that a small portion of her cervix was removed, though i have no spoken to her about this recently. 

I'm not assuming she doesn't want to get help (and by help i mean taking steps to improve our sex life), but i do know that she hasn't brought it up to me. I've tried to just talk about the fact that we don't have sex and she'll either start crying or promise we will in an imaginary future.  

""The reason why she is not having sex with you is probably she is afraid of reliving that experience and/or she is ashamed of herself because she is missing part of her sexual parts. I think a lot of what's going on has to do with fear, not anger.""

yes, i totally agree that this is a huge part of it. i hope with counseling we can move beyond this. i dont think she hates me, and i think fear is definitely in the equation."
15433,"Right, and it's great that you're doing so well! But it doesn't seem like his GF is and it's not very productive to dismiss her feelings because you're handling it better than her. It's not like we're talking about a simple cold here or something, she had to have surgery to remove pre-cancerous cells which is a mindfuck in and of itself. She might be afraid that it will come back if she continues to have sexual contact with her bf. And maybe she does want kids, so the LEEP procedure is really scary looking at it from that angle."
15434,i never said she had cancer. she's got precancerous cells. 
15435,"HPV *can be* a big deal for women. With yearly pap smears, any pre-cancerous cells can be caught and treated early enough that they are very, very unlikely to cause any problems - and most people's bodies will overcome the virus and no longer show any signs of it within 1-2 years, especially if they're young. Pap smears are about the most effective form of cancer prevention out there. In the end, HPV is only a big deal for women if they don't get yearly checkups and/or if they don't have health insurance to cover their care.

~ a person who formerly showed pre-cancerous cells, had them removed, and is now showing HPV-free pap smears 2 years later."
15436,"Out of curiosity, is it possible to have precancerous cells that aren't caused by HPV? Can the doctor say with certainty that's what caused it?"
15437,Mental/emotional. She's gone through some tough shit and it looks like she really needs help dealing with it.
15438,Counseling. She needs it and you two as a couple also need it if this is going to be fixed.
15439,"She had a cervical biopsy done, and it's not fun. The Dr go in and snip a few skin sample. It is painful and you can't have sex for at least a week. I was extremely careful but still had an infection and that made the recovery even longer.

I was extremely distraught when my pap came back abnormal, and the possiblility of having cancer is scary. The thing that made everything much more bearable was the fact that my bf was extremely supportive. He went with me to all the visits, asked questions about possible future complications. It made me feel safe. Even so I was still very hesitant when he tried to anything. Psychologicaly I think it made sex
 painful or just uncomfortable. It took a good while until I could fully enjoy sex again, but I knew that I had to get over it and I felt safe with my bf. 

I know how your gf feels but it is something she need to overcome. At this point therapy is probably the best idea since she have been dwelling over it for far too long. The more you think about it the bigger the problem get. I think you feel guilty for making her this way and just let her get away from confronting her fear.  I think this is solvable if she truly want to feel normal again."
15440,I should not have laughed at that.
15441,"Okay? I didn't say she has cancer either. My point is, if you - a male - know you have HPV, it isn't the kind of HPV that could have caused those precancerous cells. And if your story were true, your doctors would have told you that. "
15442,"I'm not sure what other causes there are for cervical cancer, but I know that at least at my gynecologist, it is standard to test for HPV when abnormal cells are found in the uterus during a standard yearly checkup (if the pap smear turns up normal, they do not check. HPV is not included in a standard STD panel). They can test for specific cancer-causing strains, only, and if you turn up positive, they refer you to another doctor to get a colposcopy - this same doctor can remove cancerous growths before they get out of hand, if it comes to that. Pre-cancerous cells do not mean life or death, they are just a warning to keep close tabs on your health so that it doesn't turn into cancer, eventually. "
15443,"my doctor =/= her gyno. plus, if the strains that cause cervical cancer are asymptomatic in men, why couldn't i have that as well? i may have had more than one strain. and why would i make this up? "
15444,">my doctor =/= her gyno

Which is why I said doctor*s*. A gyno is a type of doctor too. 

>plus, if the strains that cause cervical cancer are asymptomatic in men, why couldn't i have that as well?

Well you do now, if you didn't before you had sex with her. 

>and why would i make this up? 

Because you were bored and were just incorrectly educated about HPV in middle school health class yeaterday? Hell if I know. "
15445,"Get the vaccine anyway.  At 16, the idea of retaining your virginity until marriage seems do-able, but in reality, is pretty much a pipe dream.   It's much more likely that you'll have at least one intimate relationship before you meet your future wife, so to protect everyone involved, you'll need to be vaccinated.  If you aren't and unintentionally infect your wife, HPV could kill her (cervical cancer is the special little treat it gives women) and could cause birth defects in your children. 

If your parents won't approve the HPV vaccine (what kind of freaking nuts are they, anyway?), get to Planned Parenthood.  You'll receive a series of 3 inoculations.   The second one is given two months after the first and the third one is six months after the first. 

Bless you for taking your health and the health of your future children seriously. "
15446,"Are you at least 16 years of age? Most clinics, including Planned Parenthood, will provide you with the vaccination without your parent's consent."
15447,"Since certain strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer and/or infertility, it is very important that you get the vaccine. I would argue with them that you are concerned about your future health, and it is no way guaranteed that your future husband will be a virgin. Not only that, but HPV *can* be spread through more than just sexual contact. If that doesn't work, I would use the ""neglect"" argument, saying to them that they're neglecting you by ignoring the needs of your future self."
15448,"HPV is contracted through skin to skin contact of the genital areas and there's no absolute guarantee that this will be avoided. In the absolute worst case scenario, which I hope never happens to you, you could contract it through sexual assault. Point this out to your parents. It's better to be safe than sorry.

As others have said, there's a chance that the person you marry will have HPV and therefore you should still have the vaccine to stop yourself from getting it from them. Plus, if you remarry for any reason, you don't want to carry HPV from your first wife to your second.

Also, a lot of people only link HPV to cervical cancer, as the link between them is widely talked about. Tell your parents that HPV can cause warts, verrucas, anal cancer, penile cancer, cancers in the head and neck and also issues with the vocal cords. Ensure that they are aware it poses a risk to you as a male."
15449,How much does this planned parenthood cost? 
15450,I will be 16 soon but can you explain what your talking about. I am not sure about all that. 
15451,"OP is male. Not that he shouldn't get it, I'm just saying."
15452,"Fees are based on a sliding scale depending on the patient's income.   So, if you have no money, the vaccine will be given to you for free.  

Why do you say, ""this planned parenthood""?   Are you not familiar with the health centers that are located across the country?    Here's where to find one near you:   

https://www.plannedparenthood.org/

"
15453,"From the Planned Parenthood website:

""How Much Does the HPV Vaccine Cost?
Each dose can cost up to about $170, so all three shots may cost about $500. Many health insurance companies may pay for the HPV vaccines. There are also programs that allow some people without insurance to get a vaccine for low or no cost. Talk with your health care provider to get more information about these programs.""

https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/stds-hiv-safer-sex/hpv/hpv-vaccine#sthash.5i4d1raE.dpuf"
15454,Your parents are morons. You have no idea if you will remain a virgin until marriage. And you have no idea whether or not your sexual partner(s) might be carrying HPV. Get vaccinated and don't tell your parents. 
15455,"Means at 16 you do not need parent permission. 
You can ask your pediatrician to give it to you, and you can ask to talk to your doctor alone. 

On the waiting until marriage thing too. 
You can wait, and even marry a virgin. 
However, one day, you can divorce, she can pass, etc .. There are chances you may remarry or have sex with multiple people later in life.
So. It's never a bad idea to get it. You can't get it when you are 45 as an example.

Health department might be able to help too. Or try calling your pediatrician's office. They can't report it. It goes against privacy policies. "
15456,"In many places, 16 is the age of consent for sexual activity and for receiving medical services relating thereto. "
15457,"I remember something on this subreddit from a while back about the UN forming a commission to deal with women being killed by violence worldwide.

No such commission exists for men in any fashion.

Men are killed at 6x the rates of women.

So 1 women is greater than 6 men (if 1 woman = 6 men there would be a commission for both).

I suspect you'll need to get in the double digits (1:20 or so) before it's worthy of equal concern.  "

Certain parts of this post are starting to feel really repetitive.Maybe try to mix it up once in a while. Also why the need for all these accounts?"
15459,"I think this sort of ""expendable males"" view is part of evolution of most mammals. 

Imagine a small animal population that is struggling to survive. The goal of  is to pass genes from the group along to next generation. Now when reproduction requires long periods of pregnancy (human 9 months per birth is a long time), with a long period until the offspring reaches self sufficiency (lets say at least 10 years for humans) it is evident that this requires significant investment. The bigger the investment, the more the offspring must be protected until it itself reproduces, because you wont get many chances.

For mammals that only usually give birth to one offspring per long pregnancy, assuming food is not a problem, females are the 2nd most important thing that must be protected. One male can easily impregnate several females, and produce several offspring. Assuming the small population nevertheless has sufficient size so that inbreeding is not a hindrance, such a population would repopulate quickly.  However one female can only produce 1 offspring in a relatively long period, regardless of the number of males in the population, so in a high male:female population recovery should be much slower.

I think this is also why males specimens of mammals are usually stronger then females. As females are more ""protected"" and males are more exposed to dangers, males must be physically stronger to survive. 

Now in humans, it is obvious that civilized life has done away with the necessity for such evolutionary mechanisms. Monogamy, prosperity and relative safety enable us to live as a society based on reason. However, humans are still born with appendixes, although it is obvious that we don't really need them.

TL;DR In some point of evolution it was beneficial to favor females and regard males as more ""expendable"". This evolutionary instruction still resides in our subconscious and was, as man ascended to civilized life, incorporated into social norms.

*I read some research years ago on this topic. If my mind serves me correctly it was calculated that it would only take a few hundred unrelated humans to create a sustainable population, and a low male:female ratio was beneficial. Perhaps someone could google it, im sure it s outhere.

15465,"Link to your ""study"" please, or at least the yahoo! questions page.

In the spirit of completely anecdotal evidence, I conducted the same ""study"" on all the people at work today. All but one of them said they would save the 3 men, because there are more of them. The last one, a woman, rationalized that due to her limited strength and poor swimming ability she would most likely not be able to save the 3 men without drowning herself. Therefore, she would save the 1 woman because it had a higher chance of success and less chance of her drowning too."

It's also important to consider that everybody will have a different reason for answering the way they do, and I've a sneaking suspicion that most of them deal with, ""Well, they're men, so they can probably save themselves,"" rather than, ""The woman is more important.""

We shouldn't get so wrapped up in our victimhood that we attribute everything to male disposability.  I think a lot of the time, it's usually this pervasive idea that women need to be protected from the big bad world around them, or that they need help because they can't do things for themselves.  I believe that many of the problems we see (gender-bias in the reporting of DV and sexual assault numbers, just for a couple examples) would automatically correct themselves if we could fight agains the current feminist dogma and spread the idea of women as agents, rather than women as victims."

15483,"People are really passionate about this subject, so here's the short of it before you get raked over the coals:

Circumcision in and of itself isn't evil.  However, it is a violation of a man's bodily autonomy, and should be reserved for medical necessity, or men who are able to consent to the procedure of their own free will.

There's a lot of data on both sides saying that circumcision is helpful/harmful, and while I think it should be common sense that chopping a part of somebody's dick off is going to be harmful in some way, ultimately the argument boils down to the loss of bodily autonomy.  Having the choice taken away from you isn't cool, no matter what sex you are."
15484,"It has no proven health benefits, it removes something like tens of thousands of nerve endings and was essentially started in North America as a way to control men's sexuality (see John Harvey Kellogg) and removes men's bodily autonomy to decide whether or not they want their dick mutilated in some barbaric bronze age ritual, not to mention the fact that any mutilation of women's genitals is literally illegal in most places where male genital mutilation is common. Any other questions?"

15498,Rebecca Watson is great.

15508,"The question really is ""Do feminists like Rebecca Watson even care IF discrimination against men actually exist?""

You're answer is: No, Just as long as it furthers their own needs. She is in her own right a sexist by showing that her own gender needs concessions because they are female and should 'not have to work as hard as a man to achieve anything', 'are not as violent as men.' or just plain 'because a man drove them to do it'.

15509,"Feminism is based on one inarguable holy tenet: women are always the most oppressed group in every situation. 

To imply that men could have issues (and even, GASP, that women can be oppressors in some situations) is a direct contradiction of the core belief that forms her particular brand of faith.  


MRAs hate women, according to feminists, in the same way that non christians hate Jesus according to radical christians.

Someone posted the rant on the SGU-forums and the entire discussion centered around TJ calling the women cunts and how sexist he was. It was just a side note that they were cunts and misandrous cunts at that. 

I really started to notice how many of the men there bent over backwards to explain bad behavior, like when Watson said ALL the members of the SGU forum were scum. They went out of their way to explain and explain Watson's actions away.

Another person started a thread on whether or not the SGU forum should be estranged from Watson and clearly state the forum was not owned or affiliated with Watson or the program. The main mod even lifted a previous ban on criticizing 'the rogues'.

What do you mean by the last sentence? "
15581,"If literally the only thing you cared about was avoiding HPV, you would be better off getting one shot than zero.  You would be better off getting two shots than one.  You would be better off getting four shots than three.
"
15582,Oh of course lol sorry the wording confused me I guess. I was really only worried that I needed those other shots or I'd get HPV. Well anyways thanks for explaining it to me. 
15583,"In case you didn't know, most sexually active American men & women get HPV in their lifetime (check out the CDC fact sheet if you haven't already). Literally the majority of adults will get this disease. Anyone having casual sex/ONS should automatically assume that their partner has HPV in the first place. 

Also, the virus typically **clears itself naturally within two years**. Most people never know they had it. It really isn't a big deal. Other than the emotional trauma, did having the bumps caused you any major pain, discomfort, etc? Usually they don't. And they'll be removed & you'll likely never have another outbreak. It's not herpes. There's a lot of shame about it because it's related to sex, but the actual disease doesn't match the hysteria about having it.  

For now, use condoms and let your partners know (without making a huge deal about it) that you had an outbreak x amount of time ago. Before things get hot-and-heavy if you don't want it to be awkward. Hopefully, they've already gotten the vaccine. Otherwise, they can get it before having sex with you. After 2 years (4 if you want to be extra careful), if you'd had no more outbreaks, I'd personally assume that I no longer had HPV. 

Oh, and fyi, vaccines don't do anything if you already have the virus. It'll protect you from the cancer-causing strain (maybe you have a different one, which is likely that you got a low-risk strain if your doc is recommending getting the vaccine), and you should get vaccines, like everyone else who hasnt. But it won't do anything for your current outbreak. It's preventive, not a cure. "
15584,"Some people fight off the virus after two years or so. Others don't. There's no test for men, so even if you stop having symptoms you can't be completely sure you don't still have it. So yes, you'll have to behave as though you have it forever, even though you may not. 

For some partners it will be a deal breaker. For others it may not be. Many women now have had the vaccine, which doesn't protect against every strain but does protect against the more common ones."
15585,"If I found out that the person I wanted to have sex with had an std, the first thing that would make me feel better is if I knew that they were knowledgable about said std and cared enough that they would not spread it to me. I would want to hear, ""hey, before we have sex, I want you to know that I have hpv. Hpv stands for blah. It's an std that (loose not too graphic symptoms). We can still be intimate if blah (I actually don't know much about hpv... I'm assuming a condom protects against it? Or is it like herpes where the chance of exposure is limited if there is no outbreak? .... Er, so I'd want that explanation Hahahha)  I'd want to know the risks and such. But it would mean so much more knowing that you care enough about me to know how to protect me. 

And then knowing I'd be safe, We'd bang like rabbits. "
15586,"Not speaking from personal experience here, but I do know that breaking it to a partner can be scary. One of my close friends has HPV and she was terrified to tell the man who, in all likelihood, will become her husband. So, she decided NOT to tell him. I was strongly against this because it can be easily transmitted. She waited 6 months of having unprotected sex before she finally broke it to him. He was devastated. After much fighting they agreed to stay together. He loves her no matter what. You, too, can find someone who will love you no matter the HPV, but be honest upfront. Many woman do already have the shot, and most people carry some form of the virus (I don't recall the percentage). Be mindful of breakouts, be considerate to your partners, and know that your life isn't over. Go to the gym, go on dates, do what you would normally do, just air on the side of caution.       "

I just had the follow up and awaiting the results. My SO(same one) just told me he found bumps above his genitals, and was told by a doctor it was hpv. 

He was terrified to tell me. When he sat me down I thought he was going to tell me someone died. I could see he was so distraught over it. I know how common it is, and I know it didn't matter what we did, if one of us had it, condoms wouldn't save us. I plan on spending my life with him, and as long as it's not the kind that causes cancer, so what. It's not herpes, so I can live with it. "

Not exactly looking forward to reentering the dating scene with this under my belt though... (no pun intended)

Thanks for the support."
15594,:) I'm very glad I could help. 
15595,HPV is very common. Yeah talking about it might be uncomfortable but I'm sure it won't decimate your chances.
15596,"I'm getting vaccinated as a preventative measure, and I'll only be able to get two doses before I leave. Not sure if I'll be able to get a third in country, but it's my understanding that the first two greatly reduce your risk even if you don't receive the third. I was also told I could get the third dose when ever, if I choose to get it."
15597,Talk to the nurses through the application portal and the PCMOs when you first arrive in country. They wouldn't start the series for me but they may be obligated to finish them.
15598,"Ask your pre-service nurse in the map, they may be able help answer your questions a bit better.
"
15599,"I'm not an OB/GYN but I work at a reproductive health organization, and I know that HPV is extremely contagious from skin to skin contact of the genital areas (it can be spread during foreplay and even when condoms are used because condoms don't cover everything). I'm not sure of the stats on HPV, but I know that 1 in 6 Americans has genital herpes (HSV-II), but 80% of those people never show symptoms, so most people they don't know they have it. Peace Corps should be able to offer you Gardasil and any medication that you need during service. I would definitely start the vaccine series and do whatever paperwork that PC requires for you to continue Gardasil during training. You do not want to be in a rural area and all of sudden exhibit HPV symptoms. Also, you don't want to unknowingly transfer it to someone else (either another volunteer or a local person). Care for yourself and others! And I'm speaking as someone who contracted herpes in Liberia. Thankfully, and as they should, Peace Corps will provide me with free medication when I start this May."
15600,Gardisil was not an option in my country of service. I had it like 7-8 years prior so it wasn't recently introduced.
15601,I sent my nurse a message but since it's the weekend probably won't get a reply until later in the week. Hope they can finish it or that it's ok to miss the third dose
15602,"The doctors said that sometimes the symptoms can not show up at all or if they do they can either go away, stay the same or get worse. Seems like it's a anything can happen deal :/

They did say treatment is fairly effective and easy (cryotherapy, surgery, laser, topical ointments, etc.) nothing extensive which is good news but hopefully I didn't get it/don't have any symptoms.

Thanks for explaining all of that and hope your treatment goes well! Also how do they treat HSV? There's no cure right, just managing symptoms? "
15603,"My heart and thoughts go out to you and yours. I lost my brother to cancer recently. It's the absolute worst.

This is all good advice. If there are steps you can take to help prevent cancer, even if in a small way, take it. No one deserves it, and no ones deserves to see a loved one go through it. It's one of the worst beasts out there, and something hopefully science can defeat."
15604,Fuck cancer
15605,"Try a different doc. Myself and others are older and not necessarily the best candidates for it, but haven't been charged by our insurance for it either.       
     
edit: And ""dental work""? WTF doctor would say that? Dentists all use nitrile gloves these days, that's the last place I worry about getting HPV. Is there something I'm missing?"
15606,"Find a doctor who will listen to your circumstances. I'm WAY outside the age range but, given my circumstances, I could benefit from the vaccine. My gyn gave me a prescription and even though I've had one hell of a time getting the pharmacies to follow through, I got my first of three courses. Planned Parenthood likely won't do it for you. Insurance won't cover it but it should only cost around $300 per vaccination for the first Gardasil, the Gardasil9 vaccine is just coming under pricing in October and will be more expensive. 

I'm willing to spend a couple of thousand to reduce my chances of cancer though, so I don't care about the cost.

"
15607,Why is there a problem with anyone willing to pay for it? Am I missing something where the vaccine has a chance to spontaneously combust anyone over the age of 26?
15608,"There is no *medical* reason for not giving it at any age.  This is what happens when the CDC, FDA, and manufacturers make a recommendation, based on public health cost/benefit models, and then bureaucrats turn that into a hard rule because that's the safest way to cover their asses. They aren't scientists, they aren't in a position to know what the original recommendation was based on, and CYA is the governing principle in any bureaucrat's life.

Most doctors do not have time to keep up with the research, so they operate in essentially the same ""take no risks"" mode.  You can't get sued for following the guidelines.

And thus a VERY soft, fuzzy public cost/benefit calculation gets turned into a virtual law, even when the *personal* cost/benefit calculation is very different from the public one."
15609,Why are you so eager to get it? By manufacturers recomendations you are simply too old. Just live your life like the other billions of people who never got it.
15610,"I suppose if a provider does not feel a treatment is indicated, then it would be improper to administer it regardless of what the patient wants."
15611,Manufacturer's recommendations assume he's already had sex with a bunch of people and exposed himself by 28. He hasn't. 
15612,"That's just it, how do they know? There's no test for males to check exposure. As far as any doctor knows, a 75 year old man could benefit from getting the vaccine. "
15613,"At age 31, it's likely that you've already been exposed to HPV, so there's no need for the vaccine. It also most likely hasn't been studied in men over 26 for this reason."
15614,"Hey lakerland. Congrats on ur teams recent win. MD here. On the off chance ur still curious I would suggest getting the vaccination if u are able to afford it. 

There are multiple strains of hpv and u can help decrease the rate of cervical cancer in the women population u sleep with while protecting urself from the virus. The only problem is ur insurance may not want to cover it because theyre businesses and making money > general public health. Also studies are time consuming expensive and it'll pbly be a while before newer studies on older populations are out "
15615,But can I still get the warts and do I run the risk of possible cancer please? 
15616,"Haha thanks..... It was biter sweet but I'm happy Kobe went out in typical fashion. 
I'm 31 so would the vaccine still have an effect on me and protecting future partners please? 
Also the more imminent question is the current girl I'm very casually seeing had (her doc gave her the all clear) warts due to HPV. When having sex with her other than a condom should I refrain from fingering and oral on her please? "
15617,"Yes, you can get warts still. The vaccine generally protects only against the strains that cause cervical cancer. HPV-related cancers are rarer in men. "
15618,"Well. I don't know. And I don't think anybody does. But in my opinion I think it should protect u from the extremely rare penile cancer as well as the women in ur life from the extremely slow developing cervical cancer. So if u can afford it I would say might as well get the vaccine, but it's not the biggest of deals (like smoking cessation). 

Lol u should enjoy life and be happy. Just remember babies are expensive. "
15619,"Haha sounds like you're speaking from experience re the babies. 
I'm mostly worried about genital and facial warts at this point since a condom will def be worn. "
15620,"Oh. Well the treatment for warts is easy, u just freeze them off. What ur getting the vaccine for is to prevent u from getting penis cancer which is really rare and girls from getting cervical cancer which grows really slow. If ur in America or another developed region is not that big of a deal because u can deal with everything later. But why would u do that when u can spend a hundred bucks up front. "

15623,"I read a book (And the Band Played On) which was about the outbreak of AIDS.

A lot of gays lived in the fast lane and because being gay was more accepted, they went crazy because they missed out on the sexual liberation of the 60s. Sure, there were a lot of STDs but they could take medication for those and they'd be fine (one way to find out if someone had AIDS was to detect anti bodies for Hep-B iirc).

Then when AIDS struck, they didn't realise what it was and only a few doctors realised/thought it was to do with gay sex which a lot of the medical community didn't want anything to do with.

The AIDS outbreak started in the late 1970s and it wasn't until the mid 80s that Reagan said something about it and the medical community as a whole realised how serious it was, but some estimates said that guys had hundreds of sexual partners so it had already spread and was took ages for symptoms to show.

It's a fascinating book to read but really depressing (surprise)."

You aren't being injected with a synthetic form of HIV, the clinical trial is using a very small part of the HIV genome spliced into either unrelated DNA or an unrelated virus that usually causes a cold, called adenovirus. Neither of these could possible give you HIV or AIDS.

Some gay rights groups suggested that men stop sleeping with so many partners, close down the bath houses and use protection but it was seen as an infringement on their rights.

EDIT: Wait, was that a later diagnosis, as in people looked at his medical records a few years after or something?"
15654,"It's all good, I wasn't annoyed by your comment, I figured it was sarcasm."
15655,"I'm a male.  I received the vaccine at 18.  Not that that contributes much to the discussion, but ..."
15656,"Rayford actually had tissue samples preserved. He died of Kaposi's sarcoma, which is an extremely rare (and disgusting -- you get sores all over your body) disease that is associated with AIDS. Some doctor made the connection because the disease was so memorably rare and they tested his blood in the mid-1980s. 

It's not surprising that OP in the other thread would have encountered and slept with lots of people with AIDS, but given that he's talking about the early 90s, it wasn't really the first wave of the virus and he was being unusually irresponsible."
15657,"Let's be honest with ourselves, there was one thing which changed the public perception of AIDS in the United States. That was November 7, 1991, when Magic Johnson announced that he had HIV."
15658,"Go there, and be as usual.

You did awesome. And you sound awesome. So... keep it up!"
15659,"You did the right thing.  Your sister is just angry that your niece is having sex, and she is blaming you rather than biology."
15660,"""You're right, I shouldn't have had to say anything because her mother should have taught her this years ago. What kind of 19 year old hasn't been taught about condoms?!"""
15661,"I think you did great!  I have 3 brothers and as siblings we've all agreed and committed to being that ""other"" adult that our kids can talk to.  Kids often don't want to go to their parents with sexual things (even though we were and are all comfortable talking to my parents about it), and since we all trust each other and are family, we WANT our kids to feel comfortable going to their aunts and uncles.

I think you can only apologize to your sister that she feels upset, but say that your niece is an adult and can choose who she wants to talk to.  Next time, don't share your conversations, though.  You want her to trust she can come to you again."
15662,"80% of sexually active people get infected with HPV at some point. Usually the body fights it off on its own without complications, but some strands can result in cervical cancer or genital warts. However, it's difficult to test for and often times not symptomatic. A person can have it and not know. Hell, it's possible that you gave it to her (EDIT: sorry missed the part where you said it was from before you met). That being said, once she found out, your girlfriend should have talked to you about it. Find out why she didn't."
15663,It depends.. If its the cold sore type I've had it all my life and actually never thought of it as an sti.   It was just a sore that would pop up every few years when I got really sick or got sun poisioning (always on my lip).   My parents had let me know it was contagious so I'd always be extra careful not to share a cup/kiss/or more when it was there but I've gone 8 or 9 years without one popping up... So yes I could absolutely see how she wouldn't think of it.
15664,"Naw, it is bad type, she had to get a large area surgical removed, noticing a new area is what sparked the conversation    "
15665,"You're thinking of HSV, OP's GF has HPV. "
15666,"You're referring to herpes not HPV.  
OP, HPV goes away on it's own after a couple years, she may not even have it anymore. If what you're concerned about is her neglect in concealing this information, I think it is something that needs to be addressed. Ask her why she hid it from you, point blank. ""I forgot"" is unacceptable. "
15667,Is it low-risk HPV (warts) or high-risk HPV (abnormal cervical cells detected on a pap?). 
15668,"Oh!! Thanks, my bad."
15669,"Personally, I think it's a good idea. 

The chances of side effects are low and you never know if you may one day decide to engage in sexual activity. Since the strains of HPV the vaccine protects against are some of the nastier ones, I really think it's a case of better safe than sorry.

If I qualified in any way for the vaccine, I would get it. I'm too old (and have been over the age cut off since it came out), so it's not covered for me by insurance. If it wasn't so expensive/I wasn't so broke, I would pay for it out of pocket."
15670,"You should definitely get it. They usually will not give it to males over age 21 and females over age 26. It can't hurt to have it, but you may regret not getting it if you change your mind about sex in the future."
15671,[deleted]
15672,"Get it. You're so young that you don't know that at 30, your raging hormones aren't going to want sex for kids. "
15673,"I think it's good to have it. You never know what the future holds, and it's a pretty safe vaccine."
15674,"I think it's good to have it. You never know what the future holds, and it's a pretty safe vaccine."
15675,I did think about the rape possibility.  That itself would probably make it worth it.
15676,"Do you have sex with males?  If you lie to obtain insurance benefits you aren't entitled to, that's insurance fraud and a crime. By the way the nurse is full of crap and shouldn't be giving ""advice"". I would tell that doctor about what she told you."
15677,"This is why you don't take insurance advice from a nurse.

First off: are you certain (in that you have spoken to your insurance company) that they won't cover it in your situation? Secondly, if so, have you asked if you can pay out of pocket for it. Because while it's possible your insurance has restrictions on who can receive it, it's a valid option for everyone. Thirdly, have you spoken to your actual doctor about your options? 

If you get the vaccine and pay out of pocket, I can't see why any reporting would be made to your insurance company. 
"
15678,"You cannot be denied health insurance for [i]being[/i] gay, as a pre-existing condition. The ACA got rid of stipulations like that. 

Pretending to be gay would be fraud. 

Doctors are weird about the HPV vaccine. I couldn't get it either, because I'm too old. It's not medically viable for me. Who knows what the nurse is going on about, talk to an actual doctor about it, explain your circumstances, and take serious medical advice about whether or not it would be appropriate for you. "
15679,"Your insurance only covers a certain procedure for men who have sex with men.  Do you qualify for the coverage?

They can't drop you because you have sex with men, but they can drop if you if lie to receive healthcare."
15680,"Yeah, I do. "
15681,"If you are in fact gay, you might post this question (as in, can I be dropped from my grandfathered plan for being gay) on /r/Insurance or /r/HealthInsurance "
15682,"Okay, thanks. I'll give that a shot as well. "
15683,You seem to be looking only for advice that reassures you in not disclosing to partners about a past case of HPV. Just my initial thoughts.
15684,"Just came across this. A researcher at the Center for Disease Control talks about HPV and suggests no need to disclose past HPV infections which have cleared up: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61FqcJNEnYQ

This seems to be the general medical consensus, but now I'm questioning it on a moral ground. I don't know. 

"
15685,You should tell your partners any medical information relating to your junk always.
15686,"I don't think that the vaccine would be a waste of money because (correct me if I'm wrong) the vaccine reduces the risk of specific types of HPV that causes cancer. Other types of HPV are not affected by the vaccine, and if the type you is not the one that causes cancer, you could only benefit from it.

I don't have time now to find a source, so if I'm saying something wrong, please correct me, but I'd definitely look for a second opinion about it."
15687,"I think it's important to tell. If I were hooking up with a guy and he didn't tell me he had HPV in the past and then I somehow found out, I'd likely never speak to him again. "
15688,"If it was a simple STI that didn't lay dormant in your body, then I'd feel like I didn't have to tell after it was treated and resolved. However, for something that *does* stay in your body, regardless of risk of transmission, it's the responsible and adult thing to do to tell your partner. Everyone you sleep with deserves the ability to make an informed decision about whether or not to sleep with you. Sure, you might miss out on a few partners deciding they aren't interested anymore, but they deserve to have the choice. 

If it helps any, I'm a perpetual strep carrier, and I sometimes don't get symptoms even when the test comes up positive. I've had as many as eight infections in a year when I was younger. This past year I've only had one test show positive, but because it's still in my system, I don't share drinks or kiss people unless they are informed and just don't care. Yeah, it's not an STI, but it's still a *potentially contagious* medical condition, one that can cause permanent damage. 

I've slept with someone who had an HPV infection when he was younger. I was able to make an informed choice (protection, yes/no certain acts, follow up test for myself) and I respected that. Had he not told me and I found out later, I'd have cut off contact with him and informed other girls that I knew he had slept with previously myself.

Edit to add: yeah, 80% of sexually active women may have HPV, but there's a hunch of different strains of it. They don't all have the same kind. "
15689,"There seems to be a lot of misinformation in the replies you've gotten so far, so to clarify:
You don't carry HPV for the rest of your life. 90% of infections are cleared by the body within 18 months. 80% of adult women have been infected at some point in their lives, but that does not mean they are infected at this moment. The Gardasil vaccine protects against the four most common strains of HPV. 2 ""high risk"" (cancer causing) strains and 2 ""low risk"" (wart causing) strains. You may still be infected with any of the other strains and pass them on to partners. Getting vaccinated is not unreasonable at this point, but many doctors don't recommend it for people who have had a known infection because it doesn't make sense from an epidemiological standpoint.

As to your original question, if you've been without symptoms for two years you've probably cleared the infection. There is no way to know that for sure, though. I personally would not be offended if a partner didn't disclose if he were in your exact situation, but I am far more knowledgeable about HPV than the average person. I do personally choose to disclose my infection and it has influenced the behavior of a casual partner. I have a much more recent infection, however, and with a high risk strain. If you ever begin to show symptoms again, though, it would be unethical to not disclose your infection."
15690,Actually this vaccine is known to reduce the risk of throat cancer in men 
15691,"Yeah. I think you're probably right. I suppose I'm inherently biased being in my position. I just wish it was more clear though. Like a yes or no answer. If I had another disease like herpes or something, no question I would disclose and I would want that disclosed to me. There's not really another way to think about that one. But with HPV it seems to be a grey area... Maybe that just means I should err on the side of caution and disclose. "
15692,"That was my initial thought. But the doctor said that the strains that actually cause a physical wart aren't the dangerous cancer causing strains, and that once it's gone it's basically untransmittable. I've been asymptomatic for 2 years now too..

I just read this:
http://jezebel.com/5862955/whats-the-protocol-when-it-comes-to-telling-your-partner-you-have-hpv

And it seems like most health professionals seem to think it's a grey area, and that it kind of depends on the strain of HPV and the relationship... 

Does anyone have experience with this? Either disclosing or having it disclosed to them?"
15693,"Gardasil also protect against the strains that cause genital warts.

HPV types that cause genital warts are referred to as “low-risk.” HPV 6 and 11 are two low-risk types that are responsible for about 90% of genital warts.

Cervarix is an inactivated bivalent vaccine (HPV2) that protects against HPV types 16 and 18. Gardasil is an inactivated quadrivalent vaccine (HPV4) that protects against HPV types 16 and 18, and also against types 6 and 11, which are human papillomaviruses that cause genital warts.
"
15694,"Thanks for your thoughts.  I'm wondering have you had the experience with someone disclosing something like this? If so, how did it go? How did you feel and what happened afterwards?"
15695,"Hi, thanks for sharing your opinion. 
Yeah it seems like most people are kind of confused about what HPV is, and what strains do what - which is why i'm kind of reluctant to disclose.  Essentially the strain I had is no more innocuous than a wart you'd get on your hand or foot - and it has been gone for 2 years. 

I wouldn't expect a girl to stop me before giving me a hand-job and explain that two years ago she had a wart on her hand. And if she did, I would probably just laugh. But I think that the fact that not many people know much about it stigmatizes it - which may be another reason why I should try disclose and explain that it's really no big deal. "
15696,"Well, I mean, technically both HPV and HSV are similar in that they never go away but are usually relatively dormant after long periods of time. I think the stigma attached to STDs in general overplay the dangerousness of the illnesses. Being open about past STDs can help reduce the stigma by showing people you can live a normal life. In fact, most HPV and HSV are super common and most people have it already, they just don't know about it. Just my thoughts."
15697,"Nope. I haven't. But the future of my health is important to me and if I knew a guy had HPV, even if it were in the past, I would not want to have sex with him and that's my decision that I get to make. 

And I'm also adding to my answer. If that were to happen, not only would I never speak to him again, I'd be sure to let other women know that he had it so they could at least know and make an informed decision about it, since, if he didn't tell me, it's likely he wouldn't tell others. "
15698,That's actually not true. The body clears 90% of HPV infections within 18 months. It's not like HSV where you have it forever.
15699,"Thanks again for sharing your opinion. The fact that the other partner should be able to make an  informed decision is the reason why I'm reluctant to just blankly accpet most doctors/ OBGYNs etc. advice not to disclose. 

But I have another question. If a partner told ALL of the information, would that have a possibility to change your mind? For example, if they told you that the strain that they had (or at least the only one it was possible to know they had) did NOT cause cancer, and was extremely likely to be already cleared by their immune system (over %90). Would you consider it, or personally you still wouldn't? "
15700,You're right! Sorry--what I meant is that you're not likely to know if it goes away and they can remain dormant for long periods of time. My mistake!!
15701,"I don't know, honestly. HPV *terrifies* me. I guess it really depends on how into him I am and if I want our sex to turn into a relationship."
15702,"hmmm - do people often disclose that they have had a cold sore before in the past? I'm generally curious. I don't have them and no one has ever disclosed this to me, but now that you mention it the disclosure protocol is probably very similar. "
15703,"I guess it is pretty terrifying. It's kind of awful that the really bad strains are not even possible to detect in men. Ok, another question: knowing that most (~80%) of sexually active people will have some form of HPV, does this currently affect your behaviour with others at the moment? Do you kind of assume that most partners have something, even if they don't know it? Just curious.

Also, do you get regular pap-smears? From what I've read this should set your mind at ease a little more if you're truly freaked out. From what I've heard even the nasty strains only turn into cancer in fairly rare cases, and take years and years to develop. With regular pap smears most people do just fine, so if you're not getting tested regularly please do! 

"
15704,"I think some people do, some people don't? The stigma of herpes has really made people distance cold sores from genital sores...which are technically the same thing. People don't like thinking cold sores are an ""STD"" so they usually don't and therefore they don't disclose. It's an interesting conundrum, for sure. "
15705,"I've only ever had sex with my boyfriend, so no. If I were to have casual sex, still no, but I would also protect myself as much as possible, but that isn't just about HPV; it's STDs, in general.

I'm not freaked out about having HPV or even contracting it, because I know that, right now, I don't need to worry. The thought, however, of having it is horrible. This goes for all STDs, though this one is a bit more due to the simple fact that it *could* be cancerous...and also warts are really gross to me. And yes, I get one once a year at my annual appointment. "
15706,"Yeah, warts are gross for sure. Just a heads up though, you can definitely get both HPV and HSV while using condoms. The wart I found was lower than the condom covers.. 

Anyway, thanks again for answering all my fairly personal questions. "
15707,"I know you can, which is why I'm also not planning on having sex with anyone who has STDs (or anyone but my boyfriend, but hypothetically speaking), which is why I would like to be given a heads up if a partner had a past, likely cleared up one. But you're welcome."
15708,Make sure you have really good shoes and moisture wicking socks. I take it you are walking now and preparing for the April walk. If you want a second opinion you can see Derm but I'm guessing the podiatrist has more experience.
15709,"Thanks! I bought new shoes for the trip prep and new boots for the trip, and I use baby powder and moisture wicking socks currently.

And I guess I could do a second opinion if I see no resolution in the next couple of weeks. I was just wondering if anyone had any strong opinions or facts to share that might increase my chances of getting rid of the plantar warts."
15710,"If you want to dive into details of other options, look here:
http://www.podiatrytoday.com/article/2598
Laser and photodynamic therapies are effective but you may need to get to a large center for those. "
15711,"Unfortunately my insurance won't cover those options, but if things get out of control, who knows?

Actually, I think a brief description of coverage could be helpful for people's posts because cost can be a huge barrier to seeking the best treatment."
15712,"Health care providers would have to know the specifics of each person's insurance plan - something totally impossible. There are low deductible and high deductible, cadillac and basic plans and everything in between. It's a terrible system, causes headaches for everyone and has huge administrative costs. Much of that disappears in a single-payor environment."
15713,No disagreement there. 
15714,"1.  The vaccination probably would be of some benefit, though limited, especially given your current monogamous arrangement and her vaccinated status.

2.  AHCC is in early trials.  It is not FDA approved, so I doubt you will find any ethical medical provider who would administer it without proven safety data, regardless of its early indication of efficacy.

3.  You're essentially asking if pathology samples can be tested for strain type?  Since we do this for cervical samples all of the time, the answer would be yes.

4. If you have the vaccination can you still be a carrier for the covered strains?  No.  Your immune system is quite efficient.

5.  Your immune system is fine.  Get adequate sleep, stop cigarettes and reduce over-indulgence of alcohol, eat a balanced diet.  All of the stuff I am sure you already know."
15715,Thank you for replying so quickly.  It's really helpful to have some answers. I find comfort in that. 
15716,"whoa slow down buddy!

Bro, **calm your farm**. Worrying about shit does not help. Take a breath. Then another. Then another. Right. Now we're past that, throw away that shame while you're at it. You were curious so you tried a thing. That's nothing to be ashamed of.

It is not socially and culturally accepted to be gay. Where I am from, if you are gay then that means that you are automatically a pedophile, pervert, and into bestiality.


We are quite progressive in some sense compared to other Arab countries because we have a person who has undergone surgery to get a vagina and breasts (my government paid for the whole thing of course), and they have a job and friends etc... It is difficult to explain. The person who had the surgery was seen as someone who was sick and needed help, so they gave them surgery. I hope that makes sense!

It might seem silly to some people that I consider sharing videos and photos on Facebook to be a form of support, but things are different where I am from. Nobody speaks up about anything. And they say horrible things about people who are not straight, just general ""putting it out there"" statements. So by simply showing that I am accepting, a few people that I know superficially have come out to me and spoken to me about their struggles. The struggles of the people who are not straight in my country are very different from other countries. There are no laws to protest. But there is a culture that needs to be changed instead."
15757,"Wow, that is very interesting. Sort of like they comprehend transsexualism but not homosexuality? It's good to know that they won't be criminalized, so why can't they form a very passive and under the radar support group? If their life is not in danger and it's not illegal, why not a physical center or meetings?
"
15758,"They see homosexuality as a hormonal problem, or a problem with a lack of spiritual connection with God, or an influence from ""The Westerners"" (yes, because White people created sexuality of course!), or a person is simply confused, or the person is from a dysfunctional family with divorced parents, or a boy spent too much time with his mother growing up and played with dolls instead of cars (I am not making this up!), and a million other ridiculous things.



They don't want to form a physical support group because they are not out to each other, and they don't want to be out to anyone apart from me. It is simply not possible. If a place was constructed, then who would dare show their face? Nobody would go to it. They are always paranoid and suspicious that someone will find out their secret. Like I said, it is not illegal or dangerous for your health or safety to be gay in my country, but you will be ostracized by society and disowned by your family."
15759,"Lab technologist here. This information comes directly from the CDC.

HPV (the virus): About 79 million Americans are currently infected with HPV. About 14 million people become newly infected each year. HPV is so common that most sexually-active men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point in their lives.

**1.She received the HPV vaccine Gardasil when she was younger, which to my understanding protects her from the more serious strains. From what I have been reading, the HPV that causes Genital Warts is the low risk strain. Should I be worried that she is at a serious risk? Can she have a serious strain if I have the one that causes GW?**
Cancer often takes years, even decades, to develop after a person gets HPV. The types of HPV that can cause genital warts are not the same as the types of HPV that can cause cancers.


**2.My understanding is that after about 2 years the immune system should naturally be able to cure it. Since we have been dating and having sex for three years, is this a cause for concern?**

Genital warts can be treated by you or your physician. If left untreated, genital warts may go away, stay the same, or grow in size or number. In my opinion, if you have a way to treat genital warts, why would you instead wait for it to possibly get worse or clear up?


**3.What is the best course of action for future screening?**

Routine examinations, routine pap tests

**4.Will this affect her ability to have children? Will this affect her children?**

**^ This is your most important question to ask ^**

If you are pregnant and have HPV, you can get genital warts or develop abnormal cell changes on your cervix. Abnormal cell changes can be found with routine cervical cancer screening. You should get routine cervical cancer screening even when you are pregnant.

HPV does not cross the placenta, so it doesn't affect a fetus. Even if you are positive for HPV during pregnancy, your developing fetus is fine. 

Now, some women who have genital warts caused by another strain of HPV can pass HPV on to their infants during vaginal delivery. The infants then have warts in their throat or on their vocal cords. Even then, they don't usually have to be treated.

The HPV strains that cause cancer are not passed on during delivery. You won't have to have a c-section for that reason. You can have a regular vaginal delivery and not worry about passing on HPV. 

Hope I have helped somewhat.


"
15760,"Different strains. Quadravalent gardasil targets HPV 6,11,16,18 (causes of genital warts, carcinomas, cervical cancers). Common plantar and flat warts are caused by subtypes HPV 1, 2, 4. These subtypes are found everywhere (shower surfaces, floors, pools, whatever) so are not specifically sexually transmitted.

You were on steroids? I mean, I hate to play 'blame the drug' but it can be immunosuppressive so it probably contributed to the recent spread of the warts. The campus doc is a good bet, they can freeze them off (if covered?) or prescribe a stronger cream."
15761,"I gotcha. So I don't have an STD. That's good :).

Yes I was on Methylprednozone, that's the steroid. That was to help take care of the impetigo and because I have awesome luck, I got a second prescription for it because I got poison ivy really bad at the same time. 

I thought the Predisione was to help body my immune system? Why would that make the Warts worse?"
15762,"It's immunosuppressive - it decreases your immune system's ability to fight bacteria, viruses like HPV, etc across the board, which is helpful in contact dermatitis where your immune system is GOING CRAZY! for no good reason. For short doses it's usually not an important effect. Just a what-if."
15763,"That makes sense. What's the best way to get rid of the Warts and the virus I got? Obviously I've had it for a while because some of these have been on me for years, I just didn't care. I've been using a wart stick and I can feel it working very slowly but it mostly just kills the skin around the Warts. It works on some of the brand new fresh ones. But the one on my toe isn't going away anytime soon"

Hopefully, that clarified what (I think) people mean to say. Also, edits for grammars. "
15766,"What you went through sucked, it really did. Do you know what *really* sucks? Cervical cancer.

Let's take a step back and look at this not from the personal perspective, that's not where vaccines matter, but from a population perspective. If a vaccine has a net benefit for a society it should be presented as a positive option. So in this line of thinking if a vaccine were to have *awful* side effects, say severe issues with 5% of those who receive it, but it *saves* more individuals from the same or more severe side effects it is beneficial at a population scale. Aka, 5% will suffer with the vaccine but 10% will suffer if it is not provided so it should be provided.

It sucks for that 5%, they are worse off, but it's worse for those who don't get the protection that the vaccine would have granted.

Now, the HPV vaccine. 1 in 10,000 will have side effects greater than minor, airway constrictions being the notable effects (source)[http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/vaccinations/Pages/hpv-vaccine-cervarix-gardasil-side-effects.aspx]. What you experienced was a *very* rare side effect that I can't seem to find sources as far as this occurring in general cases. In general there haven't been large numbers of severe side effects justifying not vaccinating.

On to your article. It is shit. Sorry, but it is. There have been 200 cases. 200! If you are wondering why I point that out it is because it is incredibly low considered the number of individuals vaccinated. It states that the ""National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) has awarded $5,877,710 dollars to 49 victims in claims made against the highly controversial HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccines."" but it doesn't specify what *for*. Until that context is provided this statement means nothing.

""The adverse reaction reports detail 26 new deaths reported between September 1, 2010 and September 15, 2011 as well as incidents of seizures, paralysis, blindness, pancreatitis, speech problems, short term memory loss and Guillain-Barré Syndrome. The documents come from the FDA’s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) which is used by the FDA to monitor the safety of vaccines.""

First, they don't provide the source so bells start going off. Second, 26 deaths is extremely low compared to the tens of thousands of individuals who would suffer and possibly die from cervical cancer. If this is true then the vaccine doesn't appear that bad.

""In response to the concern about death reports among those who received Gardasil, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) insists  “there was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine.” ""

Soooooo what's the problem? If the CDC, a group unassociated with Gardasil, states that there isn't statistical evidence that there is a link. So why should I care?

""In fact, Merck studied the Gardasil vaccine in fewer than 1,200 girls under 16 prior to it being released to the market under a fast-tracked road to licensure.""

which is normal. It's called a sample rather than a census and is done in most clinical trials. You wouldn't reject a chemotherapeutic drug because it was only tested on 1200 individuals if it was proven that it worked.

""Neurologist Dr. Ian Sutton reported negative neurological side effects from Gardasil. He reported five cases of multiple sclerosis-like symptoms emerging shortly after women received the Gardasil vaccine, noting:

“We report five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelinating syndromes within 21 days of immunization with the quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine, Gardasil. Although the target population for vaccination, young females, has an inherently high risk for MS, the temporal association with demyelinating events in these cases may be explained by the potent immuno-stimulatory properties of HPV virus-like particles which comprise the vaccine.”

Without a linked to a paper that actually shows that there is statistical significance. This statement means *absolutely nothing* as far as scientific evidence is concerned. It is an observation of possible correlation. If he wanted to prove this he can set up a study and see if there is actually anything going on. If he doesn't do so then he can shut the fuck up (excuse my language but seriously, he presented **5** cases of something that he suspects might be in correlation with the vaccine but nothing more).

>HPV vaccines have been illegally administered to millions without informed consent, as the risks rarely disclosed.

A bold statement He needs to back up this *very* strong statement or I will consider him a liar.

Basically, if you had posted this on your own I would have asked for your source about 10 times and then informed you that observing a couple cases doesn't mean anything of statistical importance.

As for the author, he specialized in metabolism and diet with zero research publications that I can find. Why should I listen to him rather than pretty much  all the experts in immunology?
"
15767,"HPV sounds like it is one of the worst vaccines for adverse effects.  Do you hold the same view for measles, mumps, rubella, flu, or other vaccines as well?"
15768,"As the article notes, there's no statistical evidence that the vaccine actually caused the deaths.

>In response to the concern about death reports among those who received Gardasil, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) insists  “there was no unusual pattern or clustering to the deaths that would suggest that they were caused by the vaccine.” 

People do randomly die and get vertigo.

http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2012/05/03/here-is-how-we-know-gardasil-has-not-killed-100-people/

The same happens with every vaccine. People randomly die, as people are prone to do, and the vaccines are blamed.

It's not scientific nonsense. People have gotten sick after taking the vaccine. People get sick after doing anything as people often get sick. It's what you'd expect. Statistical analysis is better at telling dangers than anecdotes."
15769,"The HPV vaccines are somewhat unique when it comes to side effects, there are essentially no other vaccines with adverse side effects that even come close to the severity or the incidence rate of the HPV vaccines. Also there is a newer vaccine with fewer and less common side effects bit less protection. As to your CMV, reddit is big on the important vaccines (the ones you usually get as a kid), ones that are known to be safe and mostly without side effects (flu shots), and the development of new and safer vaccines. Vaccines are the most effective tool we have for keeping people healthy as they keep individuals from catching things in the first place (keep in mind that most of the vaccines are to keep us from catching viruses that cause serious issues or are commonly fatal) and helping to make sure that doctors are free to deal with other issues. 

If your car is driving strangely do you try and find out what's going on or do you wait for it to stop working? If you know that it's more likely to have certain problems would you take steps to preempt any issues or deal with them as they pop up? It's a similar situation with vaccines but with one major difference, avoiding vaccination puts others at risk. If a small portion of the population, the ones that can't take a vaccine, don't get vaccinated then it should be fine and herd immunity should protect everybody. If people with religious objections also abstain, which means a slightly larger group, then things are risky but manageable as long as the at risk parties take care (which they would anyway). If you start getting people who object for other reasons (think they're dangerous, homeopathy, etc) then things start getting dangerous because not only do you have a large number of people who are not vaccinated but you also have a lot of people who are not being careful about exposure which means that herd immunity isn't very useful, vaccines simply lower the odds of infection. Eventually you start getting outbreaks, just take a look at England and some areas of the US, and since the people effected are children (who had no control over being vaccinated), the elderly, and the immunocompromised. In some cases parents are being charged with negligence and manslaughter for their actions. "
15770,"You are right, vaccines should not be supported in all cases. 

If a child has had an organ transplant, HIV, or has a compromised immune system, they should not get a live vaccine. The only other reason why is if they are allergic to eggs, which are used to produce vaccines. There are almost no other good reasons why a vaccine should not be administered. 

People have always been afraid of vaccines, but in the past they were more afraid of the disease itself then they were of the vaccine. When polio was a threat, almost every family knew someone who had it. Nowadays, vaccines have been so effective that people are more afraid of a vaccine's potential side effect than of the actual disease. This is silly for two reasons:

1. There are minimal side effects of vaccines. If there are any, they are almost always minor and short term.

2. The actual disease is always more dangerous than the side effects, otherwise doctors wouldn't administer them. A sore arm is nothing next to becoming paralyzed due to polio.

Every single vaccine has been rigorously tested by many different organizations including the doctors and scientists who develop them, the pharmaceutical companies which sell them, the Food and Drug Administration, which approves them, and the Center for Disease Control, which continually checks on them. These are just a few of the organizations who check on vaccines, and there are hundreds more both in the US and abroad. Yes it's possible that every single person who has ever studied the vaccine has missed a side effect, but it is incredibly unlikely.

It is frustrating that even though vaccines are highly effective, very inexpensive, have minimal side effects, have been rigorously tested, and have saved billions of lives, people who don't understand even the basics of medicine will refuse them because they are afraid.

For example, people are afraid of autism, but instead of trying to find the root cause, they simply blame vaccines, despite the fact that the only person why has ever suggested that they were responsible was proven to be a liar and a fraud.

It's possible that the HPV vaccine has some deadly side effects that we don't understand yet, but right there is no scientific evidence that it does. What we do know is that for the minute risk of fainting spells, we can prevent the spread of a virus that causes genital warts and cancer, and which 79 million Americans already have, and 14 million new Americans get every year.

I would say that vaccines are absolutely worth the cost benefit ratio for almost every single person on earth, even if the side effects were much worse than the tiny ones that exist now."
15771,"Interesting. You mean that if someone researches a vaccine and is concerned by the severity or the frequency of the negative effects, they shouldn't be able to decline? Just clarifying here."
15772,"Thanks for this!

I'm going to have a good think of this all through before I start dishing out the deltas, though. Right now my main concern is that, in the absence of any way to predict whether a patient will have an adverse reaction, it seems like force-feeding people peanuts (just because they've never tried peanuts before and therefore don't have any evidence that they're allergic) is the wrong move. Again, though, I'll think about it."
15773,"I apologize about the article. You've clearly given it far more attention than it deserved, and quite frankly I feel silly having linked to it now. Man, I really feel bad that you wrote all that out.

Apart from your excellent disaccreditation of the article, you make really good points for the most part (as have many others in this thread), but I'm still not sure I feel comfortable with them. I'm on board with the large-scale population arguments, but I don't think it's fair to throw individual concerns in the dumpster. The macroscopic decisions and policies should still be justifiable on a microscopic or individual basis, don't you think? "
15774,"Well, to tell you the truth, I haven't really researched any of those vaccines, because I haven't been presented with the option to take them. Like I said in the post, if a doctor prompted me to make a decision concerning, say, a measles vaccine, then I would take time to research it and come back with maybe a yes and maybe a no. 

I *believe*, all though I'm not sure, that I had already received most of those vaccines as a kid before the whole vertigo thing scared me into skepticism. I trust my parents researched them before signing me up.

Does that answer your question? "
15775,"Not precisely concerns, but real medical conditions or past predispositions."
15776,"That is an interesting problem. Dissent based on emotional arguments and religious faith arguments are often accepted as reasons to reject vaccinations but people with rational objections are not given the same consideration. I think it is (along with other reasons) partly because the rational objections are usually misguided though, and better information simply addresses them. For example, you can look online to see the actual frequency and severity of side effects, which is not perhaps as significant as some online sources might report. So, an argument about fears over those issues can be readily addressed. 

I see another issue here too though, the personal issues with a vaccination. When a patient has an issue with a vaccine, like yours, I think it should be recorded. By reporting serious reactions to the health authority they can escalate to the appropriate people and it will be recorded accordingly. That way, these issues are recorded and can be monitored (like frequency and severity of reactions) and that information can be dealt with. What I think happens often though is that a doctor or a patient won't report negative side effects and the result is that they become anecdotal, and not really taken seriously. So make sure that your doctor or health authority records and reports serious side effects if you want personal issues with a vaccination to be considered."
15777,"Unless they can prove that they are uniquely vulnerable, no, no declining. Informing yourself of the risks is important, but in order to protect herd immunity, we must eliminate the ability to freeload on other people's acceptance of vaccine risks.

I do think there should be a very strict process for a vaccine to be certified safe enough to become mandatory - I would not support mandatory HPV vaccines as they are today due to the high frequency of ill effects. There should also be a grievance procedure to strike a vaccine from the required list if a mandated vaccine is evaluated to be too risky.

Edit: clarified what I was saying no to."
15778,"I think what he's saying is that the negative effects of vaccines are mitigated by the benefit it provides both the individual and the collective. According to the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/side-effects.htm), there are risks to vaccines, just as there are risks to anything. I looked at the DTAP vaccine, which is a pretty common one, and the worst side effect attributable to the vaccine were seizures (1 in 14,000) and very high fever (1 in 16,000). The mild problems were almost non-issues (swelling, mild fever, etc.), and the severe side effects were so infrequent that they couldn't even determine that the vaccine caused them.

A reasonable person should look at that and say that immunity to deadly diseases is worth temporary discomfort. The rare cases are just that: rare."
15779,">I apologize about the article. You've clearly given it far more attention than it deserved, and quite frankly I feel silly having linked to it now. Man, I really feel bad that you wrote all that out.

No big deal really. It's occasionally fun to tear apart anti vaccine articles like this.

>you make really good points for the most part (as have many others in this thread), but I'm still not sure I feel comfortable with them.

Thanks and that's perfectly understandable.

>I don't think it's fair to throw individual concerns in the dumpster.

And under no means should we. If there is a risk involved with a procedure (as there is with vaccination) it requires a fair amount of justification to force someone to partake, they should have decision making abilities.

>The macroscopic decisions and policies should still be justifiable on a microscopic or individual basis

That they should. But we often look at the *bad* parts of events without seeing the good. You got to experience the bad, the one in a very large number negative side effects but let me ask you this, if that one month of vertigo resulted in you *not* passing on HPV to someone you are intimate with with the end consequence being they *don't* get cervical cancer that they otherwise would have, would it have been worth it? I would make that sacrifice (having seen my father go through vertigo, I get what you went through. It really, really sucks) 10 time out of 10. What would you think of someone looking at your case thinking ""I don't want to go through that"" and being the direct cause of a partners cervical cancer? I'm not trying to use rhetorical devices here, it's an honest question.

I guess what I'm trying to get across is that it can be looked at as a microscopic level of *harm* that is caused, but it can also be flipped and you can look at the microscopic benefit. Good that comes from vaccines at an individual level. A mother who gets to be there for her children, a child who doesn't die from small pox, etc. A vaccine that harms 0.1%, probably from minor or non life threatening effects, may be the direct cause of benefit, sometimes life saving, for many millions  of individuals."
15780,You probably did get the childhood ones - there are a standard set of vaccines that a child must have before entering public schools in most parts of the US.
15781,">Does that answer your question? 

Yes it does.  It looks like other people have posted all of my other questions, so I'll leave it at that."
15782,"What exactly do you mean by ""past predispositions?"" And who would be the judge of whether or not their ""medical conditions"" or ""past predispositions"" are valid?

Say, for example, a vaccine was shown statistically to have more common negative effects on people who weighed under 120 pounds. If you happened to find yourself in that category, should you be allowed to be exempt from the vaccine?

The other problem is that this proposal is sort of ""shoot first, ask questions later."" If there are serious or lasting injuries, deaths, you name it, couldn't they be avoided by the industry's acceptance of a healthy dose of skepticism? I mean, if there were some well-tested and harmless way to test a person's potential reaction to a vaccine, then I would support it, but I'm not aware of anything like that."
15783,"As far as I know, my reaction to the vaccine was reported by my doctor. I have no way to verify this, but I trust the doctor I had at the time. I agree that this should always be the case - that is, everyone who has a negative reaction should make it known - but as it is, this lack of reliable information about specific vaccines is a serious issue. Even though I researched the meningitis vaccine, for example, it was still difficult to know whether I was really hearing the full story. For all I know, people could have had reactions like mine but were silenced by the neverending flow of vaccine defenders. I think this sort of gung-ho activism that we see on reddit only alienates victims of ill side effects and prevents the good information from being seen. The way things are now, it's difficult to determine whether a vaccine is safe for you."
15784,"Perhaps in an ideal world, we would have a method of making sure that the certified vaccines are indeed safe. However, isn't this a bit like arguing for and against the death penalty while pretending that the justice system is capable of distinguishing innocence from guilt 100% of the time? 

I would seriously consider the sort of measures you're proposing if all vaccines used in hospitals today were guaranteed to be safe. I really wish that were the case, but it isn't. For that reason, I just can't agree with a mandatory measure. Even you seem to acknowledge that, with the current supply of vaccinations, vaccines just aren't for everyone. I think we're on the same page here."
15785,"They are rare, I'm sure, but I'm unable to dismiss them as negligible in my mind. Hmm. This sort of ""ends justify the means"" type of argument has cropped up a lot. I'm still thinking all this through."

"
15788,"> And who would be the judge of whether or not their ""medical conditions"" or ""past predispositions"" are valid?

I would argue that exemption is decided by your Doctor. They aren't going to vaccinate you if they feel the risks to you outweigh the benefits. And in general they will be better informed than you. Using your 120 pound example - you might have read on that on the internet, and it's the principal recollection of someone who was refused the vaccine. Your doctor might know that that is only applicable to people over 5'6 and want to give you the vaccine anyway. 

> The other problem is that this proposal is sort of ""shoot first, ask questions later."" If there are serious or lasting injuries, deaths, you name it, couldn't they be avoided by the industry's acceptance of a healthy dose of skepticism? 

Vaccines are a preventative medicine for serious diseases. The more you wait the more people do get seriously ill and/or die. If something has passed through the full clinical trial and licensing system it must be of greater benefit and risk - so 1000 people like you getting vertigo, is better than 10,000 getting HPV."
15789,"For what its worth, I had severe vertigo much how you describe yours for a week after receiving the flu shot a few years ago. I did report the reaction. I was still glad to receive a flu vaccine each year since then."
15790,"Well, I guess I am saying the patient has to advocate for themselves somewhat to make sure the doctor is reporting the information to the health authority. 

At any rate, it seems a little like you are saying you distrust the information. If the information, like the ill side effects, are being reported, than there is nothing really preventing that information from being available. You can look and see for yourself:

http://www.atlantique.phac.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/12vol38/acs-dcc-1/index-eng.php

I am not sure how you believe ""gung-ho activism"" would alter that? It seems that the data can be assessed rationally, you can look and consider it for yourself. The risks seem very low. The benefits seem high. 
"
15791,"I look at it like this: Being unvaccinated puts everyone around you at greater risk of sickness or death. Generally speaking, there are legal or civil consequences for putting people at risk of injury or death, even if it was unintentional or through inaction (eg. negligence lawsuits). 

A city has the power to chop down a tree in your yard that threatens powerlines, even if that tree has once stopped a car from hitting your house when it missed the turn and could do so again. It appears that it is legally and morally acceptable to force an individual to accept a small degree of risk in order to protect others from a risk magnitudes larger. "

And I understand that it's rare, but it's surely frequent enough to warrant at least considering not receiving the vaccine."
15795,"If you disagree with your doctor's designation, couldn't you simply switch doctors? Also, there's the problem of doctors not necessarily knowing everything about your health or lifestyle - most times I go in to the doctor's office I'm still told that I need to take the second installation of the HPV vaccine.

Which leads me to another point - a vaccine like HPV requires several installments to be entirely effective, anyway. Isn't it worth considering that the actual reduction in HPV might not be worth forcing people to receive the vaccine? Especially when people simply aren't at a point in life when they can risk side effects like that? Maybe they're expecting a baby, or something like that. There are plenty of reasons people might object to being vaccinated that strike me as perfectly valid, given that my past experience dictates that negative side effects such as vertigo are a very real possibility."
15796,"Like I said, I still got the meningitis vaccine. I'm not against vaccines in principal."
15797,"When I said gung-ho activism keeps truthful information from being spread, I was referring to the way in which people who share their legitimate stories of being harmed by vaccinations are silenced or at least not given fair consideration. I do suppose that going on the internet and sharing something is a less credible way than reporting it to your doctor - however, I'm sure most people do both. 

Thanks for the link! Out of curiosity, mind sharing how you came across it?"
15798,"Yes - it's called asking for a second opinion. And taking a patient's history before treating them is part of being a Doctor. They say you should have the second treatment and you bring up that you've had a bad reaction in the past.

>  Especially when people simply aren't at a point in life when they can risk side effects like that? Maybe they're expecting a baby, or something like that. There are plenty of reasons people might object to being vaccinated that strike me as perfectly valid, given that my past experience dictates that negative side effects such as vertigo are a very real possibility.

I think you may be misunderstanding what people have said when they call for mandatory vaccination. It doesn't mean we ignore all other potential medical complications. If the risk to a patient is greater than the benefit to them the vaccination should not take place. When people say that vaccination should be mandatory they mean that there should be a genuine medical reason not to vaccinate, as decided by a doctor - rather than ""I heard from a friend of a friend it causes autism"" or ""all the other kids are vaccinated so it doesn't matter"".

In your specific case, you have that genuine reason not to get the second injection. A friend of yours who saw it first hand does not - because your reaction is incredibly rare and the risk of him having it (and it's severity) is deemed on the grand scale to be less than the benefits of him not having or transmitting HPV.
"
15799,"No problem. I just looked it up because you were concerned about the HPV vaccine specifically. Google fu?

For the record, stories on the internet are a very poor way to learn about things. Certainly is better if you have a concern to share it with your doctor and look for credible sources. It is a better way for your concerns to be addressed too.

15800,"Okay. What you've pointed out is similar to what /u/l3un1t said below. It seems I've misinterpreted the arguments I've been hearing, or that the arguments I've been hearing haven't come out correctly, or whatever, but anyway, I see what you're saying now. For the sake of keeping each conversation fresh, let bring up some other points with you:

What is the method by which we weigh the risk against the benefit of vaccination, particularly when we have no real way to tell what the risk is? I understand that pre-licensing statistics can be used to measure the risk of side effects, but here I'm referring to the risk for a single person in receiving the vaccine. Actually, wait. Was I more at risk than the average person? Or did I have the same level of risk and just get incredibly unlucky? (I don't really expect you to be able to answer those last two questions, I'm just musing.) In any case, I wouldn't take the second injection.

Is it really wrong, though, for me to object to my friend getting the HPV vaccine? Forget about the legality of it for a second, if you will. This isn't hypothetical, by the way. I am legitimately afraid for my friends when I hear they've taken the vaccine. Do you consider that irrational? "
15801,"Pre-licensing statistics will try to get information on the incidence of side effects and the severity. So they might find for instance, 1 in 10,000 normal (i.e. without health conditions which would preclude vaccine use) people have side effects like a headache. And 1 in a 100,000 will have serious side effects like vertigo. If the serious side effects are e.g. heart failure or liver damage, the vaccine won't go to market.

It is then up to the pharmaceutical company to decide whether to put the product up for licensing  and the licensing board to have the final say - is the potential risk worth the benefit. They then follow the drug after it's been released to see if there are any effects (say in a particular ethnic group who might not have have been represented in the clinical trials) that haven't been noted.

Now you were sort of at no more at risk than anyone else and more at risk. Think of it like a peanut allergy - you are more at risk of reacting to peanuts, but within the population in general your risk of having a peanut allergy is no greater than anyone else's. And there's no way to tell until you eat a peanut.

Carrying the metaphor to your next point - not wanting your friends to get this vaccination is like not wanting them to eat peanuts because you had an allergic reaction. Yes, peanuts are harmful to you but their risk of having a peanut allergy is still incredibly low."
15802,"Should we not be allowed to disagree with this licensing board's decision about the vaccine? And, I really hate to say it, but aren't we giving the licensing board an awful lot of power? There is money involved in the vaccines, and surely the companies that produce them would benefit from their vaccine being pushed into the market, no? I realize I'm starting to sound like a conspiracy theorist, but I'm really just trying to see whether it makes sense for a concerned citizen to be able to refuse a vaccination. 

I guess the problem with the peanut analogy is that peanuts can be tried. You can have one peanut, or a part of a peanut, before you shove a whole handful of them into your mouth. Even if you are allergic, you probably won't die because you can try them out. This isn't the case with vaccinations; sometimes it will be too late once the vaccine is administered. "
15803,"Firstly regarding the trust/power of the licensing board. You've already given it. Whenever you take a drug or go to a hospital, you're accepting that the FDA or MRHA knows what it's doing. If you can't 'trust' them on vaccines then you're saying that no drug is ever safe to use, because they all go through this process. And the principles underlying these bodies - such as evidence based medicine and the clinical trials process are fundamentally flawed.

As stated previously vaccines are primarily effective when everyone is vaccinated. What you're saying is that someone who is essentially a layman should be allowed to put themselves and others at risk, because they disagree with experts and all of the accumulated evidence. It'd be like letting me alter the design of a bridge over the protestations of architects and engineers.

> Even if you are allergic, you probably won't die because you can try them out. This isn't the case with vaccinations; sometimes it will be too late once the vaccine is administered.

Actually some people 75-100 people in the US do. And the number of actual deaths that can be plausibly, scientifically linked (note **linked**, not caused by) to vaccines are so low it doesn't show up in statistical analyses."
15804,"Δ Well this is probably one of the most stupidly late deltas to have been given, but hopefully deltabot will still count it. I apologize for deserting the thread back then. I'm not exactly sure why I put off coming back to it for so long. Anyway, you're absolutely right, hardly any room for counterargument, and you have certainly changed my view. Thanks."

15806,"HPV has become the leading cause of head and neck cancer in men under 50. HPV is so prevalent that 80% of sexually active people will be exposed at some point in their lives. Remember, in a way you don't have sex with just one person; you are also sharing the same germs from everyone that person has had sex with. If you haven't been sexually active yet, I strongly encourage the vaccine.
I'm shocked the NHS doesn't cover the vaccine."
15807,"I have understood that the major reason men are encouraged to get the HPV vaccine is to decrease the number of inoculations in their future sexual partners. That being said, HPV is associated with [penile cancer](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/446554-overview#a8). It is not as well studied or established as the link between HPV and cervical cancer in women. 

If you do decide to get the vaccine, check to see if the new Gardasil 9 is available. It protects against several other strains of the HPV virus. Not all of these strains cause CA (strains 16 and 18 are famous for that), but they do cause anogenital warts, which are not fun. "
15808,Get the vaccine and practice safe sex. HPV+ cancers are on the rise for men. See if there is a way you can get it less expensively. 
15809,"She ""doesn't believe in vaccines""...hmm...sort of fitting that she got HPV then in my opinion (anti-vaccers are crazy!!).  As for your question, you can still get the vaccine as it only protects you against certain strains. So it will protect you in the future from acquiring those particular strains, but it won't help you get rid of the strain you're already infected with."
15810,"The vaccination only covers a few strains of the virus, in particular the common ones that are linked to cancer. It doesn't protect you from other strains. HPV will eventually flush out of your system after a few years. [This is a good summary of why you shouldn't be that concerned](http://markmanson.net/std-guide)."
15811,"Gardasil protects against the two strains that cause ~70% of HPV-related cancers and the two strains that cause ~90% of warts. If you haven't previously been exposed to those strains, Gardasil will provide protection against them, so certainly there may still be a benefit.

But, as has been mentioned, you're 27. Gardasil's only currently approved up to age 26, and while it's not too hard to find a doctor willing to administer it off-label, insurance absolutely positively will not cover it (because it's off-label). You'd have to go out of pocket, which in the US puts you at around $500 for the full series."
15812,"The vaccine protects from several potential strains you have yet to be exposed to or infected with. If you have already been infected with a particular strain, it doesn't do anything. However if you have yet to be exposed it to a certain strain it can still cut your cancer risk.
Most people understand that HPV causes cervical cancer however it is also the leading cause for throat cancers in young men. It is worth men getting the vaccine too."
15813,"There are heaps of different types of HPV virus, and the vaccine prevents against a few of the nasty ones that cause cancer. You've already been exposed to one of the viruses, but not necessarily one of the scary ones. The vaccine is definitely worth it (make sure you get all three shots, or it's useless.)"
15814,"A vaccine does not work if you already have the virus, and in fact, will probably cause more harm than good since a vaccine is just ""deactivated"" HPV. 
If you're SURE you have HPV, then a vaccine isn't going to do you any good."
15815,"I'm pretty sure you're too old to get the vaccine, actually.

Fda only recommends it for people up to 26."
15816,I laughed out loud thinking of anti vaccers refusing to get HPV vaccine due to fear of developing autism. I just read an article that olive oil is very efficient  at battling certain cancer cells. Sales should drop shortly
15817,You've probably already been exposed to HPV if you've had sexual contact with other people before this. Vaccination isn't recommended over the age of 26.
15818,">Men cannot contract the desiese,

NOPE

I'm vaccinated"
15819,"If you can give it to a partner, you can contract it (you have contracted it, or you couldn't transmit it). Men get HPV all the time. It causes genital warts. What men don't get is Cervical cancer, which may be caused by some strains of HPV. It may (evidence is mounting) be the cause of some throat and oral cancers. It's as much for your protection as for women's.

"
15820,"Men can get HPV and it can affect them (see men getting throat cancer from oral sex). I say yes, men should get it done, unfortunately you'll probably have to pay for it out of your own pocket. "
15821,"Well chaps I did not know any of this, I find myself enlightened."
15822,"Of course. Even if you don't care for your own health whatsoever, you should always get vaccinated because it contributes to herd immunity."

15824,Considering it's news to most men that men *can* get HPV why is the massive advertising campaign promoting vaccination only directed towards women?
15825,I'm vaccinated
15826,"To all the guys reading this: Please, please, please get the vaccine. I recently had to deal with pre-malignant cervical cancer. I'm fine now, but the whole ordeal was just awful to go through. Although you can't get cervical cancer, it can still affect you! There is some evidence that HPV may be linked to throat/oral cancers. Also, you could pass HPV onto a lover, and that is not something you want anyone you care about to go through. My doctor told me over 96% of women will have HPV at some point in their life (stats are unknown for men because it's hard to tell if they have it, even with tests), mainly because most people don't show any signs so they don't know they have it. Please get the vaccine, it will help keep you and your partners safe!"
15827,In Australia all students in year 9 get the vaccine. It is done through schools and is free.
15828,"I stand corrected.
Sorry, I'm just going by what I'm told.

I am also vaccinated."
