I am a stressy person, I don't smoke and I get colds quite easily so I don't have the strongest immune system which may be a possible reason it keeps coming back. 

I was never confident with myself and always loathed the way I look. Now I have the lovely addition of HPV to add to the list as well as the scars one of the creams left me with (which look absolutely hideous!). 

To make things worse, I've met a really great guy. He knows and has been very understanding but I worry he doesn't know as much about it as he thinks we can have sex soon. I'll be seeing my doctor soon to ask when and if it even is possible to have sex in the next month or so but I highly doubt it. My worst fear is that he gets this from me. I'm already worried I've passed it on to him whilst I thought I was infection free (9 month gap without warts). I've already told him he should consider seeing other people as it might be a long wait.

This is a silly argument in my mind, but the thing that gets me is that I've heard some of the same people argue in favor of circumcision because it provides a tiny bit of protection against STDs.

So 3 day old boys need to have part of their genitals cut off because if not they'll get AIDs, but girls are supposed to go without a perfectly safe and effective vaccine because they only need it if they plan on slutting it up?

I'm usually very upfront about it, but because we mostly used condoms in the beginning of our relationship, I honestly didn't even think about it when we did have sex without a condom, as it was very unexpected/spontaneous.


The reason I'm worried about telling him is because I've told people in the past, even before having sex with them, and they have totally flipped out. I assume they had no idea about HPV, and that a ton of people in the USA have it. I'd prefer it if my current guy didn't flip out...since, you know, I really dig him.


Anyway, I need help coming up with a tactful, but totally honest way of telling him so that he understands how bad I feel about not saying anything and also comes out of the conversation feeling informed about HPV, not scared or confused.

HPV in men is on the rise. Oral sex is one of the causes of HPV, so it's likely that cases of HPV in men are increasing do to men giving women more oral sex.

HPV has been linked to various cancers in both men and women. Although more women die a year from HPV related cancers, a few thousand men a year die to.

Yet all we heard for the longest time was how the HPV vaccine should be free for girls...but no mention of boys. All national programs were aimed at girls, and obamacare provides free STD screening and testing....for female citizens only, after a massive lobbying push from national feminist groups.

Why don't male taxpayers have this same right? Why should I be denied something that might save my life just because of my gender? I thought feminists were AGAINST that kind of thing?

The fact that HPV can cause health problems in women was often used in pro-male infant circumcision arguments. So, it's ok to mutilate and slice up a child at birth in case an adult women doesn't practice safe sex? Needless to say, nobody will dream of saying we should start altering girls body's to protect male health later on in life.

So because its worse in females, its ok to ignore it in men? Just imagine the reverse- a disease that is worse for men, but still kills a few women to. Imagine if national policy was only helping men and ignoring the women, and imagine if large, national mens rights groups were backing it and pressed it into a national healthcare act.",9/8/2013 9:48

As a bisexual male, I'm aware that I'm in a higher risk class for colon and throat cancer, vis ’ vis the Human Papilloma Virus. The phrasing ""through 26"" is somewhat ambiguous for me, and I've submitted a request for further clarification to my insurance provider (their call center is closed over the weekend, so I'm e-mailing them just in case I forget to call on Monday). Because of waiting so long to get it, there's no way all three injections will be covered by insurance, since I'll hit 27 before, at least, the third injection (unless we bend the rules and get the third one in about two weeks early).

According to the clinic I visited today, it's about $230 per dose. If it were $100, I'd have said, ""screw it,"" and got it whether I was covered or not. I can swallow $300 over six months, but almost $700 over six months is a bit harder on my budget. I'm debating doing it anyway, since it's hard to put a price on my health (the person I saw today made out a prescription for me, so if I decide to go through it, I just need to show up and get it done), but I'm wondering if I'm being a bit paranoid.

Quick facts: 26, no penetrative sexual history to report, sexual history is reasonably safe (and boring, not that safe is by necessity boring), birthday is in the last week of February, I actually have a proper insurance plan, with a reputable national provider, through my employer.

I've put in a request to my nearest Planned Parenthood for an appointment this upcoming weekend (the only time I'll be able to be 100% positive my work schedule won't get in the way).

Reminder: Get Vaccinated for HPV if You Haven't Yet,2126,982zza,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/982zza/reminder_get_vaccinated_for_hpv_if_you_havent_yet/,611,1534547064,"This might be a bit off topic, but I'd just like to remind everyone who hasn't gone through with getting, yourself or your children, vaccinated for HPV to get that done at the soonest possible opportunity, and because HPV is sexually transmitted, and one of the most common STIs, I figured this is a right place to post this.

The motivation for making this post and the reason I remembered is that my best friend recently got diagnosed with cervical cancer. I don't have the info about whether it was definitely caused by a strain of HPV that the vaccine prevents against or something else, but HPV is heavily linked to cervical cancer as well as other cancers (penile, anal, throat... etc). The good news is they caught it very early, and it is operable, but needless to say is still worrying and sucks. So in addition to getting vaccinated, make sure you keep up to date on getting checked out.

Now I'm going to take a minute and rebut some of the more common reasons for not getting vaxxed:

* ""A licensed physician has told me I have a medical condition that makes me unable to safely receive a vaccine""- You're good. Lets hope enough people heed the warning for herd immunity to protect you.

* ""I'm/my child is a male. The HPV vaccine isn't advertised as much to me, and I cannot get cervical cancer""- Well first off, cervical isn't the only form of cancer related to HPV, men can get other forms of cancer from an infection. Second, HPV can be carried asymptomatically, and to my knowledge no reliable test exists to diagnose men who don't show symptoms. You could be a carrier and not know, so it is best to protect yourself and by extension any partners from contracting and spreading the disease.

* ""I'm/my child isn't sexually active at the moment""- Protect your future self.

* ""The vaccine does not protect against all strains of the disease""- True but it is better to be protected from some strains rather than none.

* ""I do not want to encourage my child to become sexually active too young""- Your child will do what they want, and will find a way to be sexually active even if you try to prevent it; it is best to protect them in that case, or for in the future when even you think they're ready. They are also likely smart enough to know that getting a shot to protect against a potential illness is not a free pass from you to sleep around.

* ""the vaccine isn't 100% effective so there is no point in getting it""- Some protection is better than none, few if any medical treatments are 100% effective, but they're better than nothing.

* ""Vaccines don't prevent illness; they cause it""- That statement is absolutely and demonstrably false. ( edit: Many people responding have stated that on this particular vaccines the risks outweigh the rewards, but as of yet none have provided specifics or documented evidence. I am not completely closed minded on this issue, but please cite a reputable source if you would like to ""educate"" me. Otherwise it is safe to assume you're talking out of your ass)



* ""my naturopath says...""- unless that is followed by ""I'm not qualified to educate you on vaccines; go to a real doctor"" just go get the vaccine.

I hope this reminded at least a few of you to get the shots, or to schedule your kids, if you haven't already. Sorry for that bit of condescension towards anti-vaxxers at the end, but my patience is wearing thin with them (I can edit that part out if the mods deem it necessary.) 

Edited to add: if you are still on the fence, wondering if it's too late for you, or hesitant for any other reason. Please discuss this with your physician; I am not qualified to give that level of medical advice, and am currently going with what I understand to be the current medical consensus. Even if you dont just go out and get the shot, please at least discuss it with your physician.

If anyone has evidence that my understanding of the consensus is flawed, I'd be happy to review that evidence, but since at this point you're making the extraordinary claim, the burden of proof is on you.",18/8/2018 7:04

Safer Sex for Long & Leaky Play?,2,9ordjy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexover30/comments/9ordjy/safer_sex_for_long_leaky_play/,13,1539749960,"I've \[37F\] encouraged my new partner \[36M\] to see other people because I'm not able to go all in emotionally  after an emotionally draining LTR, and I only have the energy to see him a few days a week anyway.  It's going really well.  (Pretend I said that with a giant grin, because I did. We're insufferable. It's great!)

&#x200B;

Now for the fun/tricky part:  he has an unusual orgasm/arousal pattern for a man.  He's very sensitive and cums easily, but doesn't have to stop play.  He'll lose his erection, but not his sensitivity or interest.  He has almost always had 1-2 orgasms by the time I get his clothing off.  By orgasm 3-4, PIV is out of the question, but who cares?!  I wimp out and end play after several hours, but he's had actual orgasms roughly every 30 minutes, and leaks plenty of precum most of the way through.  Plus, after the first couple of orgasms, he's much too small to keep a condom on.  Our play is far from strictly genital focused, so we tend not to think about it, and it's too easy for that stuff to get everywhere.

&#x200B;

If it were just me, fine - any sperm that manages to make it through a copper IUD AND the pill probably belongs to some sort of god.  But him seeing other people - male and female - seems to be really good for both of us.  We don't want to be idiots and/or get a serious STD.  We've invested in preliminary testing, committed to ongoing testing, and we're excited to get the HPV vaccine now that it's approved for adults up to 45.  How much are we risking if we ignore the leaking dick in the room when it isn't actively penetrating anyone?  Are there ways to mitigate that risk?

British MRAs explain in which areas men are discriminated,71,9ca47p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/9ca47p/british_mras_explain_in_which_areas_men_are/,11,1535898578,"Summary of their 2015 manifesto:

Š— 

**1. HEALTH**

a. In the UK there are two national screening programmes for female-specific cancers, none for male-specific cancers, although as many men die from prostate cancer, as women die from breast cancer.

b. A public inquiry is required to identify viable strategies to improve menŠ—Ès health, with a view to developing a national menŠ—Ès health policy. An inquiry is required to consider prostate cancer specifically, with a view to introducing initiatives to increase survival rates dramatically. This will inevitably require a considerable increase in public funding of research into, and treatment of, the disease. A national screening programme for prostate cancer should be introduced as a matter of urgency. Men over the age of 40 should have their PSA levels measured annually.

c. Developing the capacity of individual men to improve, maintain and monitor their own health is vital. From pre-school onwards, information and advice should be delivered in a manner consistent with male viewpoints. This should incorporate health promotion, education, the personal development necessary to utilise services effectively, the self-confidence to request and accept help, and the ability to cope with changes in physical and mental functioning.

d. Boys should be given the HPV vaccine.

e. Hormone replacement therapy should be available on the NHS for men, as it is for women.

f. GP surgeries should allow people to register near to where they work, as well as near to where they live. At least one GP practise in each area should be open for everyone Š—– not just people registered with that particular practise Š—– until 21:00 on weekdays, and 09:00 to 17:00 on Saturdays.

g. More resources should be devoted to identifying men suffering from depression, and treating them appropriately.

h. More resources are required to diagnose and treat the mental health conditions of men in prison.

**2. MALE GENITAL MUTILATION**

a. Male Genital Mutilation on individuals under the age of 18 should be illegal other than on grounds of medical need. All MGM operations should be registered, the reason(s) for them being performed recorded, and the related information passed to the Department of Health for publication. Until MGM is made illegal, it should only be performed after the application of local anaesthetic. Only medical practitioners should be permitted to perform the operation, and only in registered medical premises. Men may choose voluntarily to have MGM performed on themselves any time after their 18th birthday.

**3. EMPLOYMENT**

a. The government should strive to reduce the male unemployment rate which is higher than the female unemployment rate and has been for many years.

b. There is another serious aspect to male unemployment:

\- Unemployment is known to be a key driver of marital breakdown,- Unemployment is also known to be a key driver of the high male suicide rate,- Suicide is the leading cause of death of men under 50 in the UK

**4. SUICIDE**

a. Male/female suicide rate differential in the UK nearly doubled between 1982 and 2012, from 1.69:1 to 3.3:1. Suicide is the leading cause of death of men under 50, 26% of men between the ages of 20 and 34 who die have committed suicide (only 13% of women in the same age band). A public inquiry should be held to explore the male suicide rate, and determine a practical strategy to reduce it. This should include measures to address the root causes of what drives men to take their own lives, as well as what is needed to better identify men at risk of committing suicide, and what essential support is needed.

**5. HOMELESSNESS**

a. Almost 90% of street homeless are men. The stream of young people moving into social housing after being in care would diminish rapidly if families were stronger, family breakdowns less common, and fewer young people placed in care in the first place. Our proposals on strengthening families by ending the Š—…winner takes allŠ—È system in the family courts would help reduce the problem of homelessness.

b. It is iniquitous that men forced out of their family homes after family breakdowns are deemed 'intentionally homelessŠ—È, even when they have left their homes to escape abusive partners. Local Authorities should bear a responsibility for providing them with accommodation, if they are not in a financial position to afford accommodation.

**6. ARMED FORCES VETERANS' ISSUES**

a. Armed Forces veterans are being denied adequate support for dealing with mental health issues, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

b. It is unacceptable that a dual diagnosis is being used to deny veterans concurrent treatment for both mental health issues and substance abuse problems (generally alcohol). Resources must be increased to the point that all veterans with a dual diagnosis receive prompt and comprehensive treatment for both problems. Many veterans are not receiving the support they need following a Š—…dual diagnosisŠ—È of possible mental health issues and substance abuse. The NHS typically requires them to be Š—…cleanŠ—È for a number of months Š—– often six or more Š—– before becoming eligible for treatment. The substance being abused is generally alcohol, a depressant, which makes treatment more difficult. However, these men risked their lives for their country, and deserve the extra investment that would be required to treat men with dual diagnosis.

**7. FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME**

a. Victims of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome should be entitled to criminal injuries compensation from their mothers for inflicting Grevious Bodily Harm on the unborn child.

In 2014, a test case was brought by lawyers on behalf of a six-year-old girl. Three Court of Appeal judges were told that the 17-year-old mother was drinking Š—…an enormous amountŠ—È while pregnant, including a halfbottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day. However, the judges ruled the girl was not entitled to criminal injuries compensation from her mother. In a later section of our manifesto, on the criminal justice system, we explore the issue of women often not being held accountable for their actions and inactions. If men were treated as leniently as women by the criminal justice system, five in every six men in British prisons wouldnŠ—Èt be there (according to evidence provided).

**8. ACCESS TO CHILDREN AFTER FAMILY BREAKDOWNS, CUSTODY ISSUES**

a. Fathers and paternal grandparents are being denied access to their children and grandchildren following family breakdowns.

b. Separated fathers should have reasonable access to children after family breakdowns

Around one in four children lose contact permanently with their fathers following family breakdowns, mainly due to the failure of the family court system to ensure them reasonable access. This is emotional abuse of children, fathers, grandparents and others. More than 90% of the parents denied reasonable access to their children by family courts are fathers, but we support the rights of all parents to be granted reasonable access to their children after family breakdowns. The combined effect of family breakdowns and an anti-male family law system has led to 24% of all British children having no contact with their fathers. These children are more likely to suffer disadvantage throughout childhood and adult life. The reluctance to reform this system among those who work in the industry (lawyers, judges, court staff, court experts) is driven more by financial self-interest than concern for the welfare of children. Family Law has become a multi-billion pound industry. We propose a simplified legislative model, intended to remove the need for the great majority of contested court proceedings in cases where parents have separated and are unable to agree the living arrangements for their children. (...)

**9. EDUCATION**

a. Proposal: the option of all-boy schools with all-male teaching staffs should be introduced for these communities that want them.

b. Women are given financial assistance denied to men, e.g. at Brunel University, only women doing one-year-long MSc courses in Engineering are given an additional Î£22,750.

The state education system has become ever more dominated by female teachers over many years. Between 1970 and 2010 the proportion of female primary and nursery school teachers rose from 77.4% to 87.4%. Over the same period, the proportion of female secondary school teachers rose from 45.4% to 62.3%. The state education system is run with the objective of advantaging girls over boys from their earliest years. In an interesting analysis, William Collins wrote of teachersŠ—È pro-female bias starting to create a Š—…gender education gapŠ—È in 1987/88, when Š—…OŠ—È levels were replaced by GCSEs. The gap appeared for the first time that year concurrently with the introduction of continuous assessment by teachers. Predictably, the gap has led to women now taking the majority of university places (57% in 2012/13). The long-term trend for there to be less physical activity in schools is known to have a negative impact on boysŠ—È academic performance, contributing to the gap. A larger problem is the sexism of female teachers, which contributes even more. A study conducted by researchers at the London School of Economics found that boys have realised female teachers award lower grades to boys than to girls, theyŠ—Ère demotivated by this, and donŠ—Èt work as hard. Girls donŠ—Èt exhibit the same demotivation with male teachers. The growing influence of feminists in education is a disturbing but predictable development, following the feminization of the teaching profession. Karen Woodall wrote an article on the matter, Š—…Brainwashing Boys: Feminist Doctrine for the Early YearsŠ—È, following a speech given by Yvette Cooper, Shadow Home Secretary.

**10. PRISON SENTENCING**

a. Five out of six men in British prisons wouldnŠ—Èt be there, if men were sentenced as leniently as women for the same crimes.

b. The prison population in the UK is around 84,000. Over 80,000 of these are men. William Collins published a detailed article, Š—…UK prisoners: the genders comparedŠ—È. It ends with the following conclusion: Men are subject to massive gender discrimination in the criminal justice system. If male offenders were treated in the same way as female offenders, there would be only one-sixth of the number of men in prison. About 68,000 men would not be in prison if they were female, leaving a male prison population of only 13,000.

c. For men, prison patently isnŠ—Èt working as a deterrent. Conditions in many menŠ—Ès prisons are brutal. ItŠ—Ès been estimated that 72% of prisoners have at least two mental health issues, and prison has been described as Š—…long-term warehousing of the mentally illŠ—È. Most prisoners have mental health issues Š—– as well as drug dependency, illiteracy, and innumeracy Š—– and prisonersŠ—È time could be used to address these issues, but it isnŠ—Èt. The coalition has cut spending on rehabilitation programmes. As testament to the ineffectiveness of prison, we need only look at re-offending rates. Of the male prisoners released from prison in 2003, almost a third returned to prison within a year, almost half within three years, and 59% within 10 years. The government needs to go beyond warehousing male criminals, and to invest a great deal more on rehabilitation. It should hold a public inquiry to explore why other countries have far lower re-offending rates than the UK, with a view to following their examples

d. In an age of equality, it is iniquitous that the justice system treats men far more harshly than women. The government should hold a public inquiry into the matter, with a view to ensuring that the justice system becomes gender-blind. Men and women convicted of the same crimes should be equally likely to face incarceration, and serve the same sentences.

**11. POLITICAL REPRESENTATION**

a. The government should create a new cabinet position, Minister for Men and Equalities, to represent the interests of men and boys. The office holder should be a man, and should have access to the same level of resources that are available to the Minister for Women and Equalities.

b. Jess Phillips (a Labour MP selected from an all-women shortlist) tried to block the application of Philip Davies (a Conservative MP) to hold the first debate on menŠ—Ès issues ever to be held in Parliament, on International MenŠ—Ès Day, November 19, 2015. Happily, the debate went ahead, anyway. Ms Phillips won a Š—…Toxic Feminist of the MonthŠ—È award in recognition of her attempt to block it.

**12. FATHERLESSNESS, ENCOURAGING STRONG FAMILIES**

Today, fatherhood is being systematically removed from society by governments of all political hues who espouse the Harman/Hewitt political doctrine, through the family courts in their decisions about child access after divorce, and through the widespread development of single parenting, usually single motherhood. Fatherhood is deemed unnecessary by the state, so taxpayers are subsidizing sperm banks for single women and lesbians. At the lower end of the social scale, women are choosing what has become known as Š—…bureaugamyŠ—È - marriage to the state. They are having children with no intention of being married, and seeking the support of the state as the surrogate father. Given that men collectively pay 72% of the income tax collected in the UK, women are effectively replacing men as partners, with men as taxpayers. Findings from a recent study suggest that children who experience parental separation are more likely to report psychological distress when they reach their 30s than those who grow up in an intact family. Furthermore, the findings indicate that this association does not diminish over time across generations.

Teenagers living without their biological fathers:

\- Are more likely to experience problems with sexual health- Are more likely to offend- Are more likely to smoke- Are more likely to drink alcohol- Are more likely to take drugs- Are more likely to play truant from school- Are more likely to leave school at 16

Young adults who grow up not living with their biological fathers:

\- Are less likely to attain qualifications- Are more likely to experience unemployment- Are more likely to have low incomes- Are more likely be on income support- Are more likely to offend and go to jail- Are more likely to suffer from long term emotional and psychological problems- Are more likely to have children outside marriage or outside any partnership

Proposals to restore healthy fatherhood:

a. Tax advantages for married people should be restored (or introduced in countries which never had them).

b. The state should stop subsidizing sperm banks for single women as this encourages fatherless families.

**13. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE**

a. Male victims are being denied support. Men are almost 4/5 of all domestic violence victims.

b. Intimate Partner Violence is not a gendered problem but a generational problem, women are as physically aggressive as men towards intimate partners, as evidenced for example by a 2013 study Š—…References Examining Assaults by Women on their Spouses or Male Partners: An updated annotated bibliographyŠ—È.

c. Gender biased family services discriminate kids by working from the feminist perspective of seeing a woman who is vulnerable instead of a woman who is dangerous to her children.

d. Male victims (29%) are nearly twice as likely as female victims (17%) to not tell anyone about the partner abuse. Only 10% of male victims will tell the police (27% women), only 22% will tell a person in an official position (38% women) and only 10% (15% women) will tell a health professional.

e. Virtually all refuge places are allocated to women and children. Without reducing the support given to female victims of IPV, Local Authorities should make funding available, and other support, to groups supporting male victims, whether through the provision of helplines, refuge places, or in other appropriate ways that take account of menŠ—Ès needs in crises such as this. The amount of funding and support should reflect what is known about the proportion of victims of IPV who are men. Funding should include awareness raising initiatives to make men aware of the existence of support services.

f. The government should introduce mandatory IPV perpetrator courses Š—– for both male and female perpetrators.

**14. SEXUAL ABUSE**

a. Women are responsible for a substantial proportion of sexual offences, including sexual abuses of children. People struggle to recognize women as perpetrators of sexual and non-sexual violence, in spite of the weight of evidence showing them to be frequent perpetrators of both. This is because the public has become conditioned to viewing men as perpetrators, and women as victims.

b. ItŠ—Ès known from a major American survey that over 25% of sex offences are committed by women against men (with no male accomplices). We would therefore expect the male/female ratio of people charged with sex offences to be a little under 3:1. The real ration in the UK in year 2013 was 146:1.

c. A major public information initiative should be developed to educate men and children about the issue of sexual abuse carried out by women.

d. A public inquiry should be held to establish why women are so rarely held accountable for the sex offences they commit, with a view to holding them properly accountable in the future.

**15. PATERNITY FRAUDS**

a. Women possess considerable reproductive rights, but choose their responsibilities. They can abort unborn children, have their children adopted, or bring up the children themselves Š—– if theyŠ—Ère single mothers, largely at taxpayersŠ—È expense. In stark contrast, a man has no rights at any stage, but is expected to bear heavy financial responsibility for his children, even when his partner has chosen to become pregnant without his express consent. A manŠ—Ès consent to sex is not the same as his consent to fatherhood.

b. Paternity fraud is an egregious assault on menŠ—Ès human rights Š—– it is fraud. It is also a cruel assault on the children who are born into this arrangement, whether or not they later learn who their true fathers are. William Collins has written impressive articles on paternity fraud, touching on the iniquity of DNA paternity tests having no legal validity unless the mother agrees to the tests being carried out - which must change.

c. Paternity fraud is such a grave assault upon the human rights of men and children that attempted (but failed) paternity fraud should attract a minimum three month prison sentence. Where a woman has carried out a proven paternity fraud, her minimum prison term should be 12 months. Where the fraud has continued for more than three years, her prison term should be 12 months plus three months in prison for each year of fraud. Frauds relating to two or more children should attract consecutive, not concurrent, sentences.

**16. RIGHTS OF SUSPECTED SEXUAL OFFENDERS**

a. MenŠ—Ès lives can be ruined by false rape allegations. The menŠ—Ès accusers enjoy anonymity, while the men donŠ—Èt.

b. The government should introduce legislation to protect the anonymity of people suspected of having committed sexual offences, until and unless the individuals have been convicted of the offences.

c. The government should introduce a registry of people convicted of making false sexual offence allegations.

**17. DIVORCE**

a. In an age of equality and no-fault divorce, when women have had the same employment rights as men for many years, it cannot be fair or just that divorced people have a right to a share of assets owned by their ex-spouses before they married, nor a share of assets acquired after marriage, other than to the extent to which they personally contributed to the creation or purchase of those assets.

**18. EXPECTATION OF RETIREMENT YEARS**

a. The government should set the ages at which men and women are entitled to receive the state pension, at levels which ensure that (on average) men and woman can expect to draw their state pension for the same number of years.

**19. ABORTION**

Elective abortions are permissible in Britain up to 24 weeks after conception, yet medical teams are fighting to save the lives of foetuses of around that age, and increasingly they are succeeding. Conversely, there are medical teams at work in the same hospitals killing foetuses of the same age, prior to extracting their dead bodies from their mothersŠ—È wombs. We find this morally indefensible. There comes a point at which the basic right to life of an unborn child overrides the right of a woman over her body. One personŠ—Ès rights end where another personŠ—Ès rights begin. In an age when contraception has long been readily available and highly reliable, women should be held morally accountable for the children they conceive. J4MB believes thereŠ—Ès a point in pregnancy when society Š—– and the law Š—– needs to recognize the right of the unborn child to life. ThereŠ—Ès no evidence to support the thesis that abortion reduces the risk to mental health of women with an unwanted pregnancy, and clinical trials to investigate the matter would, of course, be highly unethical. There is, however, some evidence to suggest that abortion itself increases the risk to mental health, so medical practitioners who authorize abortions on mental health risk grounds are doing so in the knowledge that thereŠ—Ès no body of research to support their authorizations.

Proposals:

a. Therefore, in the UK the Abortion Act (1967) should be amended to limit womenŠ—Ès right to have an abortion on the grounds of reducing the risk of injury to their mental health to a maximum of 13 weeks after conception. At this stage the gender of the embryo is unclear, so this would result in the end of gender-specific abortions, the incidence of which in the UK is a matter of some dispute.

b. The Abortion Act (1967) should remain unchanged with respect to womenŠ—Ès rights to have abortions carried out on the grounds of reducing the risk of injury to their physical health.

I never saw how she was up until 6 years ago when I stopped being the Christian she wanted me to be. She would manipulate me to believe my dad is a horrible person while I was growing up which led me to be resentful towards him. I'm glad I recovered my relationship with him recently through seeing the truth.

She's been trying to control me with guilt my entire life. She is a very extreme Christian who would scare me by telling us the end of the world was coming soon all the time. I couldn't swear, made me believe that listening to pop music on a Sunday was evil, never taught me anything about sex ed, denied me from getting the HPV vaccine because ""my children don't sleep around"" and generally made me have a severe guilt complex which affected me a lot in my teenage years. I ended up getting into crap situations through my naivety and never stood up for myself because of how she taught me to basically be a doormat. I'm glad to say that I managed to get rid of that guilt and can now enjoy things without feeling it.

Anyway, a few years ago I lost one of my siblings and I knew that I had been in a photo with him a few months before. But this photo seemed to have disappeared and was meant to be on Nmom's camera. I don't know if she had deleted it or the file got corrupted but she blamed me because she said I spent too much time at my ex's house and was never there with my family. I could see that she was trying to control me with guilt once again.

She loves taunting me about relationships. When I broke up with my ex she was all ""I told you so"". She would hate me going over his house and think I had replaced her with his parents. This was far from the truth as ex was an abusive person with parents  that hated me. Anyhow she'd love to bring up this ex at any chance to try and annoy me even when I said to her it upset me. She'd just find it funny. The last time she did it was on my graduation day. I really didn't want to invite her but since I was the first out of my siblings to graduate I thought she would be grateful. Thankfully I invited one of my sisters as well so it could be more bearable. She acted weird all day, like she was super anxious. We went to a caf’© beforehand and she just complained about the price of coffee and when she ordered it her voice was so quiet like she was scared. She made the day feel awkward from the start and tried to go into clothes shops when I needed to register on time and got annoyed when I stopped her. She was acting as if the day was about herself. She refused to talk to me and was suspicious of my male friend, asking if he was my boyfriend (he was but I hadn't told her because of what she is like). She just kept talking to strangers on the street instead boasting about how her daughter was graduating. And then just prior to the ceremony she decided to ask me about my ex then laughed when I got annoyed. Then in the queue in she brought up ""remember your dad is dying"" because he has terminal cancer. It's like she wanted to ruin my happy day and make me feel like shit.

And that leads me onto the most recent interaction. I finished my temp job early because my dad was rushed into hospital and my sister said it didn't look good. While he was still in hospital and I was in the family house she laughs asking why I was visiting and saying ""it's not like your dad is dying"". I was so angry at her and upset. Fortunately he managed to come back home after treatment. And then she kept on bringing it up with him about ""if you hadn't listened to me you would have died"" boasting and wanting some sort of praise for saving his life, saying it literally about 3 times a day. The audacity after she had laughed at me for visiting saying it wasn't serious (she hadn't even bothered telling me in the first place, was my sister who told me). She always talks casually about  him dying as well ""when your dad's gone"" as if it's not a big deal. It's emotionless. I stayed for 2 weeks and it was unbearable, constant arguing with me, shouting at me, wanting to know why I hold grudges against her etc. She implied that my boyfriend is like a dog to look after yet has never even met him, then made out my best friend is a bad mother because her toddler screams, stating ""my children never screamed"" . She can't see anything she does wrong and constantly denies things she's said in the past. There's a lot more going on as well but far too much to discuss in this post. I'm just sad that I can't enjoy time with my dad when he hasn't got long left because of Nmom's behaviour.",15/10/2018 3:45
HPV disclosure - open discussion,20,9k1yr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/9k1yr0/hpv_disclosure_open_discussion/,1,1538296334,"As you know HPV can be cleared by the immune system or become not detectable. CDC says ""More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection."".

It means that:

* some people clear HPV infection
* some people have persistent HPV infection
* some people have latent / dormant HPV infection

If you have persistent infection (high risk HPV on HPV PCR tests OR genital warts recurring for long time) then it's simple: YOU SHOULD DISCLOSE. Active infection = high viral load = it means that you are contagious. Of course lots of people don't know about their HPV infection but it doesn't mean that you should spread HPV. No one wants this shit.

In case of genital warts remember about recurrences. As CDC says:

> Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%), whether clearance occurs spontaneously or following treatment

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html

so again: disclose. But later (after a few months) it's getting more complicated:

Immune system can 100% remove the virus OR the virus can stay in latency. How many people will have latent / dormant infection? It's really hard to say. There are no 100% bulletproof numbers. But we can suppose that...

> A key uncertainty in the natural history of HPV infection within an individual is whether an HPV infection that becomes undetectable on repeat testing has truly cleared, or whether the virus persists at low, undetectable levels or has entered a latent state. While distinctions between the latter two scenarios are controversial, studies suggest that re-detection of the same HPV type is relatively common, occurring in at least 10Š—–20% of women observed to have Š—“clearedŠ— the virus

https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/9/10/267/htm

And now - this re-detection of the same HPV strain can be caused by reinfection with the same strain OR reactivation of the latent infection. Latent infections are not contagious (because virus is hiding from the immune system) however they can be reactivated by i.e. pregnancy / ageing / weaker immune system / mechanical wounds (animal studies) / UV light (animal studies). 

**What doctors say about disclosing HPV?**

First opinion:

> Given the ubiquitous nature of HPV infection, unless her partner is a virgin, the odds are pretty darned high that he already has had HPV. He may actually have the infection right now and be the one who gave it to her. On the other hand, he may have had it in the past and already be immune to the strain of HPV she has. Or be infected with another strain she does not have, so that she may actually be the one taking the risk by sleeping with him.

> There is no role for partner notification and  treatment in preventing the spread of HPV. The only thing that partner notification accomplishes is to turn women with abnormal paps into pariahs, while the rest of the HPV infected men and women out there continue to copulate in blissful ignorance.

> I do think itŠ—Ès worth discussing with your current partner if you discover that you have genital warts.More often that youŠ—Èd think, the male partner may have  small, previously undetected genital warts that are amenable to treatment. He can visit his doc for a careful exam and get treated if warts are present. That in turn may help you clear the infection faster yourself, since your immune system wonŠ—Èt be under constant barrage with high viral loads from your partner.

> The good news for HPV-infected women is that almost all HPV infections will clear. Once HPV is gone, your increased risk for cervical cancer goes with it. As does your risk for transmitting the virus to others. Which takes care of the issue of future partners.

http://www.tbtam.com/2012/01/must-tell-your-partners-that-have-hpv-doc-says-no.html

Second opinion:

> ""If you know you are HPV positive [with a low-risk strain not known to commonly cause cancer], I donŠ—Èt feel you have to disclose that to your partner,"" Jacques Moritz, ob/gyn at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, tells SELF, noting that even though safe-sex barriers like condoms and dental dams don't fully prevent HPV transmission, you should still use them. Moritz isn't adamant about people needing to disclose those forms of HPV because they're so common and usually not a risk to your health. ""Any man or woman should assume their partner has HPV because itŠ—Ès that ubiquitous,"" he explains. So ubiquitous, in fact, that doctors don't routinely test for HPV during Pap smears when a woman is under 30, he adds. But there are still reasons it can be a good idea to tell your partner.

Third opinion:

> Many of the 150 viruses that fall under the HPV umbrella won't harm you at all, and you'll never know you had one because they often clear from your system all on their own, board-certified ob/gyn Antonio Pizarro, M.D., tells SELF. Š—“ItŠ—Ès not a badge of shame,Š— Pizarro says, so telling someone usually doesnŠ—Èt need to be a huge production. Š—“I would just bring it up as saying youŠ—Ève tested positive for HPV, itŠ—Ès super common, and a lot of people have it,"" he says.

https://www.self.com/story/telling-partners-about-hpv

Fourth opinion:

> Š—“HPV is extraordinarily common and is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Almost every sexually active person gets exposed to at least one, if not several, of the 15 carcinogenic viruses,Š— said Mark Schiffman, MD, head of the HPV unit at the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

> Š—“If youŠ—Ève got HIV, youŠ—Ève got HIV, but if youŠ—Ève got HPV, youŠ—Ère about to not have HPV,Š— Schiffman said. Š—“Nine out of 10 times you donŠ—Èt have it in two years. Maybe your body suppresses it like chickenpox, maybe it is completely gone, but the result is that you are OK.Š—

> Š—“If you look at the curve, what it shows is that if you wait six months, youŠ—Ève gotten rid of half your worry,Š— Schiffman said.

Fifth opinion (from 2009):

> What can be said with certainty is that the most sensitive tests available--tests that detect HPV DNA in genital tissues--become negative within 6-12 months in over 90% of infected persons. We also know that once the test becomes negative, the person is immune to catching the same HPV type again, which is further evidenced that the infection was truly eradicated by the immune system. However, it remains possible that HPV DNA (or maybe even intact virus particles) persists in small amounts, too small for detection by the available tests. Whether this happens at all, or in what proportion of infected persons, cannot be known with certainty with available technology. But if infection persists, it almost certainly is in amounts to small to be transmitted to another person and probably will never re-grow to cause warts or precancerous growth. But in most persons the most infections are controlled by the immune system and most experts believe they are truly cured. For ""quick and dirty"" responses by clinicians like me, the evidence is good enough to say ""cure"" and to reassure our patients accordingly. 

> My practical take-home message is that after several months with no wart recurrence, normal pap, the person can consider him/herself cured; this is practically true if not always biologically true. Such persons probably transmit HPV to future partners rarely, if ever. Accordingly, I do not consider it ethically mandatory, or even recommended, that every person who ever has had HPV must henceforth and forever tell future partners they once were infected. My personal judgment is that you should inform partners in the next 3-4 months after your warts have disappeared, but if after then you have had no recurrences, you can safely assume your immune system has cleared the HPV infection and no longer need inform partners. 

>  For a new partner, you probably can start having sex as soon as the warts clear up. That soon, you SHOULD tell your partner, because there is still some chance of transmission. If s/he is aware of the low risk of an adverse outcome and feels OK with proceeding, don't let HPV stand in your way. If it has been longer than 6 months, I don't think you need say anything. Some people would endorse 3 months, 4 months, or a year; the science doesn't allow any more precision than this. I say 6 months. 

https://ehealthforum.com/health/info-on-hpv-t173358.html

Sixth opinion, from /r/Virology /u/CJay07

> I studied HPV for my PhD work, and the statement that ""HPV is with you for life"" isn't accurate. Most sexually active individuals are infected with HPV at one point during their lifetime. Epidemiological estimates range from 60-80% by the time you reach your forties. However, most infections are cleared by the immune system within a few months. A small subset of those individuals that do not clear the virus maintain a persistent infection (~1-2 years), but even those infections get cleared. An even smaller set of people go on to cancer. By that time however, the virus is generally long gone. One common situation in HPV-associated cancer is where the viral genome accidentally becomes a part of the host chromosome and the oncogenic (tumor promoting) elements of the virus become constitutively expressed. Those elements lead to rapid cell growth, among other things. Despite a little bit of the viral genome present at this stage, no viral particles can (or will be) produced.

> HPV infects basal epithelial stem cells, which are self renewing and give rise to the rest of the skin architecture. Here, the virus is maintained as an episome (viral DNA tethered to the host chromosome). There are no in tact virus particles here. Just viral DNA. It takes about three weeks for daughter cells (cells produced from the epithelial stem cells) to reach the surface, and it is not until during the final stages of cellular differentiation (cells becoming keratinized, stratifying, forming the uppermost layers of the skin) that you actually get the production of infectious virus particles. The virus coat (capsid), which envelops and protects the viral DNA, is produced very late during skin differentiation. This is a very fancy mechanism for immune evasion if you think about it. The superficial layers of the skin are not routinely surveyed by the immune system (because these cells are going to die), so by the time HPV expresses its most immunogenic products (the capsid proteins), immune cells are rarely to be found. This is one thought for how HPV can persist for so long (months to years), although the virus has many other ""tricks"" up its sleeve to hide from the immune system. With all that being said, when I say ""virus is cleared"", I mean the viral DNA is gone from its reservoir cell (the epithelial stem cell). Once that is gone, you don't have new viral particles being produced, and those particles that are hanging out on/in the skin will be lost during the natural turnover of the skin. This process wouldn't take long. It's more on the order of weeks, rather than years.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Virology/comments/5pu24a/question_about_hpv_virus/

Q: Are there any studies about HPV disclosure?

A: Of course yes.

> This study provides the first data on the correlates and outcomes of male-to-female disclosure of HR-HPV infection. Disclosure did not lead to a perceived worsening relationship, and as disclosers were more likely to discuss the Pap test/HPV vaccine with their partners than non-disclosers, disclosure might be associated with public health benefits that derive from discussions about preventing HPV infections and cervical cancer.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398400/

When I had a hard time with HPV I got lots of positive feedback from /r/UpperLeftyOne [RIP] so that's what she once wrote:

> HPV isn't a forever infection like herpes. Eventually, you can say with certainty, that you are clear of the infection. The problem lies is knowing when this is true. (...) So the longer you are free from physical signs of warts, the safer it is to say that you've cleared the infection. The problem is that you can't see very well. I would absolutely disclose until you've had another pelvic exam and/or Pap smear to verify that there are no more warts. It is not uncommon to have to treat warts more than once before the virus is cleared.

And how about you? What is your opinion? Do you know any other useful quotes / evidence? 

In my opinion it's important to:

* do everything to clear the infection
* keep the healthy lifestyle (no smoking / no drugs / no heavy drinking)
* vaccinate yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9
* use condoms (you can still get Herpes and other stuff, right?)
* in case of serious relationships: vaccinate sexual partners 

And what CDC says about disclosure?

> the value of disclosing a past diagnosis of genital HPV infection to future partners is unclear, although candid discussions about past STDs should be supported whenever possible.

Disclosing HPV? And other related questions (longer post),1,9j6jdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9j6jdw/disclosing_hpv_and_other_related_questions_longer/,4,1538024704,"I know this has been asked before, but the FAQ section didn't have enough info on this topic and the existing top posts have hundreds of comments and/or conflicting information. I'm hoping for some clearer information and/or reputable links to cut through the cutter, so I understand more before going back to my doctor with questions. 

I am a married woman in my late 20s living in the US, who has not had any children. I had a handful of partners before getting together with my SO, and we started swinging about a year ago. Part of that includes also sometimes have sex with other partners individually. So yes, several new partners recently and we have been playing safe the vast majority of the time. There were a few occasions where I skipped condoms. 

I recently had my first abnormal pap result (have not had any warts), coloscopy also came back abnormal, and the biopsy showed (to the best of my understanding) high grade abnormalities. My doc was saying there used to be a scale of 1 (mild) to 3 (severe), but it is now thought of just low or high grade. So my biopsy results were at a level that would have been classified a 2 in the previous system. Doc said she was 50/50 on whether to wait for 4-6 months and do another pap to see if the issue persisted or improved, or go ahead and do the LEEP now to remove the affected area. I'm leaning towards being conservative and waiting - the LEEP procedure kind of freaks me out, and there are apparently risks of pregnancy complications should I choose to have kids - but I have a lot of remaining questions about HPV and testing/transmission/disclosure even after talking to her.

1) My doc has now had 3 samples from my cervix and has not tested any for HPV specifically (a standard bloodwork STI panel came back negative). She mentioned HPV testing isn't normally done on women under 30, and yet is essentially certain that my abnormal pap was a result of an HPV infection. Not testing for it seems wild to me, especially with my doc knowing my relationship is not monogamous. I've asked questions about it a few times, but she hasn't deemed it necessary to test me. Should I push harder when I talk to her next? I don't know what strain of HPV I apparently have, or if it would be useful to know.

2) I got all 3 doses of the Gardasil vaccine in the early 2000s, but there is apparently an updated version with more protection covering 9 strains. My doc didn't mention this to me. Should I push to get it for me and my husband? Might be tricky to afford the out of pocket cost, but I think probably worth it given our lifestyle? I recognize that protection against additional strains could be valuable, and help prevent re-infection from my husband or another partner for whichever strain I apparently have.

3) About transmission/disclosure... Post-abornmal pap results, will I be at risk of transmitting if I ever have sex without a condom again? Do I need to wait until after I have a clear pap before I could feel comfortable going bare without transmitting? Note that going bare is a rare exception, but one I still want to understand what I am doing and how it could affect my partner's partner(s) if I make that choice. I'm aware of the stats about how common HPV is among the adult sexually active population, and that condoms don't provide 100% protection against transmission. My doc told me I didn't even need to disclose like I would with other STIs... Is that advice others have heard and follow?

4) For those attached ladies who have dealt with HPV infections before, how did you handle dealing with it alongside your male SO? Presumably my husband has this strain from me, but I know there is no test for men. I don't think he has gone bare with any swinging partners (though again, condoms aren't foolproof). He knows I had an abnormal pap, but I haven't filled him in on the HPV cause or abnormal (possibly pre-cancerous?) biopsy results. He's the type to have emotional responses, and will worry about his own risk of transmission, so any advice for how to approach him with this would be appreciated.

5) My doc doesn't seem too concerned about cervical cancer with my ""level 2"" biopsy results. So I shouldn't be either, right? 

Thanks in advance for the discussion and additional talking points I can bring back up with my doc...",27/9/2018 13:05
Neurological issues immediately following 2nd of 3-Part Gardasil Series,4,9fon5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/9fon5x/neurological_issues_immediately_following_2nd_of/,3,1536924161,"Age:34 years old

Sex: Male

Height: 6 feet

Weight: 175 pounds

Race: Caucasian

Duration: 5 months

Location: Western US

Relevant Medical History: Granular Fever/Mononucleosis 12 months ago. HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) 5 months ago. 

Medications: Gabapentin 600mg/2x daily 



History:

On April 25, 2018 I received the 2nd of the 3 shot series of the Garadasil vaccine. That night I become extremely ill. High fever, night sweats, felt my heart beating in my ear drums, and intense pins and needles feeling on my scalp. Fever lasted 24 hours followed by 2-3 days of exhaustion. 

Within the following 3-5 days, the pins and needles spread to the rest of my limbs and I started experiencing numbness and nerve pain on the left side of my face, left arm, and left leg. I feared Guillan Barre syndrome and went to the emergency room. 

The doctors at the ER were concerned, but because I still had deep tendon reflexes, could still walk, had no reduction in strength, etc. they said they didnŠ—Èt think it was Guillan Barre and referred me to a neurologist. 

Over the last 4 months, IŠ—Ève seen 2 neurologist and they are stumped. Pins and needles are 90% gone, nerve pain has increased in both legs and forearms, but still predominantly left-side. New symptoms are feelings of heaviness and skin tightness in limbs, chest, and face. Inability at times to use my hands in a coordinated manner. Typing is hard, so is small motor related tasks, mainly in left hand. I also have joint pain, and flu like feelings every 7-10 days or so that last 24 hours. 

Medical Opinions:

Neurologist #1 - Because the numbness wasnŠ—Èt symmetrical, she thought it might be some sort of demyelination of the CNS (ADEM) and ordered an MRI. MRI shows a small spot on the right side of my brain, and then orders an MRI of the C-Spine with nothing abnormal found. She believes the small spot may or not be asymptomatic but as a precaution ordered 3 days of IV steroids (wish I knew the doses). I believe symptoms were lessened for the next 2 weeks but then come back. Doctor then advised that this may be an Š—“atypical autoimmune responseŠ— from the vaccine and that it should Š—“burn outŠ— with time. Prescribed Gabapentin for nerve pain. 

Neurologist #2 - After reviewing the MRIs, is unconcerned with a CNS issue and is instead concerned with ruling out CIDP (chronic version of GB syndrome). Conducts a nerve conductivity test on left arm and left leg that all showed normal ranges. Also ordered blood test checking for inflammatory markers, Vitamin B, heavy metals. All result came back normal. He said that we could do 10mg of prednisone a day to see if it lessen the symptoms but that he believes it too is a random autoimmune response that will again, Š—“burn outŠ— with time. 

Any thoughts on possible tests to conduct or conditions to rule out would be appreciated. Should I see a Rheumatologist, 3rd Neurologist? Concerned about catching any nerve damage early so that it can hopefully be treated with improved outcomes.

Extreme and persistent shoulder pain after vaccine shot,5,93z836,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/93z836/extreme_and_persistent_shoulder_pain_after/,8,1533244950,"21 years old male, 5Š—È6Š— and 140 lbs in Californian Los Angeles.  No major past medical history and currently not on any medication.

First, let me start off by saying I am NOT anti-vax.  I have gotten all my shots and will continue getting shots in the future.

2 weeks ago I got two vaccine shot.  One of them was for my 3rd HPV shot (for the first two around age 17 and was scheduled for a third one but moved away briefly for college and forgot about it, really dumb of me I know).  The other shot was for mengitits.  Normally my doctor would do the shots but this time she gave me a prescription and told me to go to CVS pharmacy.  The pharmacist/assistant at CVS gave me a shot on both arm.  I was sitting in the waiting area and she had me roll up my sleeves.  The left arm went smoothly but I immediately felt pain when the needle went through my right arm (unfortunately, I didnŠ—Èt ask which vaccine was being administered to which arm).  I went home and 2 hours later the pain got worse.  No redness/swelling/rashes, just pain.  I read the info sheet they gave me and it said that pain was expected the first 1-3 days so I chalked it up to being normal.

The next day the pain got worse.  I canŠ—Èt lift my hand up past a certain degree, putting on a shirt hurts, and I canŠ—Èt sleep on my right side.  After a week I called CVS pharmacy and a lady told me that pain/soreness is not unusual and that it affects people differently (with some lasting more than 2-3 days).  She basically told me to wait it out and to take Advil or Tylenol.  So IŠ—Ève been taking an Advil everyday for a week and it does help ease the pain but itŠ—Ès starting to freak me out that the pain still exists.  Did an online search and found something related called SIRVA and it sounds similar to my condition. 

Making an appointment with my doctor soon but IŠ—Èm worried that sheŠ—Ès going tell me to just take more Advil.  IŠ—Èm also not sure if I should bring up the pain possibly being caused by the vaccine needle because IŠ—Èm afraid that she might think IŠ—Èm just an anti-vaxer.

Any advice would be appreciated, I just want to be able to go to the gym again :(",3/8/2018 5:22
"Need help parsing risk of HPV vaccine for child with strong autoimmune family history, please?",2,97mcos,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/97mcos/need_help_parsing_risk_of_hpv_vaccine_for_child/,6,1534398180,"Hello, doctors. 

I have a challenge for you that I have been struggling with, and present to you to discuss. I need to decide if I give my son the HPV vaccine. Before you stop reading, I am not anti-vaccine and am biased towards getting it if the risks are less than the benefits. However, it is a unique case and I encourage you to read the details and ask questions. I will need more than opinions and experiential data- specifically, I am hoping to substantiate this decisions with peer-reviewed, well-structured studies. However, I have minimal access to the proper databases as a non-medical professional. I will be following as closely as possible to answer questions as they arise about whatever I can supply information on. 

Potential Patient: 11-year-old male with no current ongoing health concerns. All other vaccinations are current. No allergies present. No significant medical history, except that he was born borderline-premature (34.5 weeks), but healthy. Currently 95% for height, 50% for weight. Development normal. 

Family History: 
Father- diagnosed with HLA-B27, Paternal Mother has Diabetes Type II, other medical history unknown.
Mother- diagnosed via blood test with HashimotoŠ—Ès Thyroiditis and via observation and pain history with Fibromyalgia.  Maternal Father- hx unknown, Maternal Mother- Fibromyalgia, HashimotoŠ—Ès Thyroiditis (via blood test), and Rheumatoid Arthritis.  

Questions regarding the safety of the HPV vaccine: 

Considering the family history of active, symptomatic autoimmune diseases within the family, what is the risk of adverse effects of the HPV vaccine for this child? (Asked to calculate direct risk.) 

Can you help me find substantiating studies on this population specifically? I have found many stating it is safe for the vaccine to be given to the general population, but these studies tend to disinclude analysis of pts with autoimmune family histories. (To be able to substantiate and support a decision in a legal setting if required. I have an attorney for the legal issues directly, but I will need supporting evidence if the choice not to vaccinate is made.)

Is an amended vaccine schedule or dose recommended?
How long is the vaccine effective? (This is to calculate risks, due to the child being so young and having several years before engaging in high-risk behaviors.)

What are the oral and throat cancer rates in males at this time, which have been related to HPV viruses? (i.e. What are the chances the child will be harmed by remaining unvaccinated?)

Are there other questions that would be a benefit to consider? 

I thank you for your time and attention in advance, and hope to be able to decide soon about the vaccine.

A question about the HPV vaccine,1,9df7sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/9df7sh/a_question_about_the_hpv_vaccine/,2,1536240776,"I am a 25 year old male and I just got the first shot of the HPV vaccine today. My girlfriend just found out that she has HPV and it most likely came from me. I most likely have had it for 3 or 4 years after doing some backtracking, so I'm hopeful that it's not dangerous.

That being said, is it still worth it to go through with the rest of the vaccine? I obviously don't want to get any other forms of the virus, but I also know that it's more rare to be harmful to men. Although I'm skeptical, I've read about some horror stories from people that have gotten the vaccine. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",6/9/2018 21:32
Genital Warts Cut Off + Electrocauterization + Interferon + 5-Fluorouracil,2,986he2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/986he2/genital_warts_cut_off_electrocauterization/,3,1534572382,"I am a male, \~35 years old.

After finding what I thought was a genital wart, I visited an HPV specialist.  He saw the wart along with a couple other smaller ones next to it.  After discussing the options, I decided to go the most aggressive route to hopefully get rid of them the quickest and in the most effective way.  He removed them (cut them off), then used electrocauterization.  He prescribed the 5-fluorouracil cream to use 3x per week.  I am also getting Interferon shots in the area 3x per week.

I have a couple questions...

1) I have read that others recommend the  Inosine Pranobex pills.  I have purchased them, but wonder when should I take them?  Should I wait until after all the Interferon shots have been completed? 

2) I am \~35 years old.  Is it possible to still get the vaccine?  And if so, should I?

I am dealing with some serious anxiety issues (I already had anxiety before this, but this has multiplied it by 100).  I have started dating an amazing woman.  We haven't had any sexual relations and I told her as soon as I found the wart (I happened to be trimming the area one day when I noticed).  Telling her was one of the most difficult things I've had to do.  She was non-judgmental and supportive, but it would be ignorant of me to think she will wait around for months and months if these don't go away, or if they recur.  So I am looking to do as much as I can to ensure I get rid of them.

Thank you for any help/sugguestions.",18/8/2018 14:06

Do I need to get the HPV vaccine?,5,8wyflq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8wyflq/do_i_need_to_get_the_hpv_vaccine/,9,1531045873,"18, 6Š—È male 156lb, dont smoke or do any drugs, I live on texas, no prescriptions or conditions. 

Whenever I went to the doctor as a kid and they asked about vaccines, my mom had them give me all of them except for the HPV vaccine. She told me it was Š—“only for those people that have sex before marriageŠ— and Š—“just dont have sex before then and you dont need itŠ—. (If you cant tell she is pretty religious). 

Is she right about that? Is it necessary or would I be fine skipping it? I dont have any upcoming doctors appointments before I leave for college so getting one just for this would be a little inconvenient, especially because of how busy I am this summer. ",8/7/2018 18:31
What would you do in my situation?,2,97u1b0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/97u1b0/what_would_you_do_in_my_situation/,2,1534467486,"Hello ,

I am a Male , age 21 and have had genital warts for nearly 2 years, confirmed by a dermatologist. DidnŠ—Èt get them removed at the time because I was told there are no negative side effects aside from aesthetics.On the day I took an STD test and nothing else came up.

I donŠ—Èt think IŠ—Ève ever had any form of HPV vaccine and am in a long term relationship with my girlfriend who has been tested multiple times for HPV and sheŠ—Ès all clear (no warts either).

I have been using apple cider vinegar for a while, it kinda works? Sometimes a wart falls off and one comes back in its place. At the moment I feel like I have quite a lot. Too many to handle with ACV. My girlfriend is very kind and understanding and thus our sex life is just fine.

I am pretty healthy, gym 3/4 times a week and drink as much water as I can. I drink alcohol but only on occasions.

IŠ—Ève read that most cases of HPV leave after 2 years, guess IŠ—Èm the minority... 

What would you guys do? Bite the bullet and pay for wart removal? Get the vaccine? Open to suggestions.

Cheers.",17/8/2018 8:58
HPV vaccine,0,9397f4,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/9397f4/hpv_vaccine/,5,1533022073,"Hello all, I'm a 28 year old male with genital warts(for about 4 months). I'm using imiquimod currently. I recently went to see my primary care doctor again and asked about getting the vaccine, even though I'm older than the recommended age. He told me it wasn't worth my time/money to get the vaccine ""because I already have HPV""

Obviously I know I have at least one form of it, so is it really not worth it? Should I contact another doctor to see if they'll give it to me? Walgreens clinics won't do them after age 26. I know insurance wont cover it, but I am not too concerned on price. 

Thanks!",31/7/2018 15:27

DAE parents have boundary issues with nudity? TW sexual abuse maybe?,21,8liwum,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8liwum/dae_parents_have_boundary_issues_with_nudity_tw/,10,1527106945,"New to this forum, have been reading through the posts for hours and IŠ—Èm finding so many similarities between my Nmum and other peopleŠ—Ès parents. ItŠ—Ès like they are all cut from the same cloth.

Through reading through the posts I have just realised, at the age of 24, that itŠ—Ès not normal for my mother to be constantly getting naked around me (IŠ—Èm female btw) I could write a novel about the messed up behaviour of this woman but IŠ—Èm wondering if anyone elseŠ—Ès mums behave like this, and what you did to stop it? IŠ—Ève tried telling her it makes me uncomfortable, but that seems to make her enjoy it more. Some highlights include:
 
kindergarten age, at the library with her, she leaves me alone in the kids section, I take a book and go sit in the general reading area about 5 meters away from a random old guy. She sees me and comes over and loudly tells me that Š—…this perv wants to f*** me.Š—È
 
age 11 or 12, $20 or so goes missing from her purse, she blames me. (I did not take it) she is hysterical, drags me outside to the corner in my tiny pyjamas and tells me to stand there and prostitute myself to pay her back.

Primary school age, the school is doing free hpv vaccines, I ask if I can get it (I barley knew what it was, I was just terrified of getting sick) and she demands to know why I want it, and how would I get hpv in the first place? (Implying that I want to have sex)

 age 12, Christmas Day. Loudly exclaims in front of my entire extended family Š—…look! Gavvn, your pubes are hanging out!Š—È (They werenŠ—Èt, this was apparently a joke.) I was mortified. I think everyone else in the room was just as uncomfortable
 
ongoing until age 16 when I left home. There is no lock on the bathroom door, pretty much anytime IŠ—Èm in the shower she will find an excuse to bust open to door. No locks on the bedroom door either and she has never once knocked.

 high school age, maybe 14, a boy in my art class asked me to mind his watch while he did something with clay, he forgot to take it back off me and I took it home with me by accident. She finds a mans watch in my bedroom and publicly accused me of Š—…f***ing grown men in my roomŠ—È (because she didnŠ—Èt think a high school boy would own a watch) 

ongoing, whenever she comes to visit she will always sleep naked with the bedroom door open while my husband is home, she will even walk to the bathroom naked.
 
this year, walk past an adult store with costumes in the front window. In front of male relatives she starts mocking me and asks if thatŠ—Ès what I wear for my husband.
 
also this year, announce my second pregnancy to everyone at once over a family group chat. Everyone says congratulations, she instead makes a comment about me tearing my vagina. Again in front of male relatives, young and old.

Why do some Nparents do this stuff?? Is it a sexual thing? A power thing? Just a serious lack of boundaries? Do they think this is normal or do they know itŠ—Ès insane? This is just a short list of many weird sexual behaviours and comments. I want this to stop! It makes me feels so dirty and ashamed and uncomfortable

Treating common wart,1,974wan,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/974wan/treating_common_wart/,0,1534245188,"Greetings r/medical!

33 y/o male, treatment: 4 days, doesn't itch, but maybe ascending pathology/soreness?

I'm concerned with the treatment of a wart on my left thumb. I'm treating it with OTC liquid salicylic acid. It formed on a crease in my thumb so I think I may be treating the roots as well. I remember treating this similarly when I was young, somewhere between 9-11y. 

My concern is that I feel tingling/soreness in my wrist as well as ascending dark red discoloration that I just noticed tonight. I know warts are viral. Do I need to worry about infection or letting the virus into my blood stream? I was already 25 when hpv vaccine was only indicated for females. So advice welcome.

Can I still go get the 3rd one even though itŠ—Ès been way more than 6 months? Or can I not complete the series now? ",25/7/2018 14:33

A week ago I got the second Gardesil shot in the series of the three HPV vaccines. The first shot was injected into my right arm and didn't hurt too much. It was only sore for about a day. But this shot was injected into my left arm. The minute it entered, it spread down my arm leaving a trail of significantly more pain than the first shot. It's still very sore a week later.

I'm so overwhelmed,5,8rokod,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/8rokod/im_so_overwhelmed/,6,1529236309,"Hey, 

I have to assume these types of posts are a daily occurrence here.  I'm so confused, sad and just flat out overwhelmed. I don't know what to do next.  My story goes something like this, I'm a chronic pain patient, 31, male and single.  I haven't had sex since my ex broke my heart 18 months ago.  I've been getting a bunch of random symptoms the last 4-6 months that neither my GP or I have any clues about.  Getting a random aching feeling around my bladder area, some pain and itching on and off when i masturbate and soreness after ejaculation.  No blood anywhere. My doctor has tested me for a heap of things and nothing. Anyways so that's the background.  To my knowledge i have never had an STD until now.  A few months ago a random 2 warts that i didnt know were warts popped up, now there are more.  Due to not having an active sex life atm i hadn't given the area much attention.  Well i met a girl i really like for the first time since the ex so i trimmed my pubic area and freaked the fuck out when there were like 5-10 warts there and went and got diagnosed immediately. 

 Now this is where I don't know what to do.  Obviously i can't act on my feelings for this girl, i'm not sure how i'm going to tell her since we're both very much into each other.  Anyways that's not the issue really i'm more worried about the greater scale of things.  My doctor just shrugged when he saw them, applied some ice to them and said dont worry about it and come back in 2 weeks.  Didn't give me anything else.  Now i've done a bunch of research over the weekend and have my eye on a few diff products to try and help heal the area quicker but really i'm super worried about why they have just sprung up out of no where when i've never had them and haven't had sex in so long.  I'm worried they may represent some form of cancer and i don't know what to do.  Please, any advice is appreciated, i am going back to my doctors tomorrow to talk about this but i want to know which specialists i should get referrals for?  Which type of doctor can give me a better idea of which type of HPV i have and whether or not they are representing a type of cancer or whether my immune system is just shot and they're just harmless genital warts.  If it's the latter i will deal, I've gone 18 months without sex and i can do another 18 months without sex if i have to. 

 I know i'm going to have to let the girl go and that makes me really sad but i don't want to infect someone and i highly doubt she'd wait for me and go through the vaccine process etc. and wait for them to possibly clear up.  There are too many unknowns there.  Anyways the girl stuff isn't the main topic here, i'm just so worried that this is cancer in which case i'm fkn done.  The anxiety i'm currently in is out of control, i cannot function or keep going without answers.  Please help Reddit fam.  Also if you have a good way to tell a girl this shit i'm open to it though it's a secondary concern right now. 

TLDR: Got genital warts randomly despite never having them and having no sex for 18 months and i'm worried they represent some type of cancer.  Which specialists can i go to to help either diagnose me or put my fears at ease?  What kind of tests should i have to figure this out?  I'm not the type to just wait and see if in a years time i have terminal cancer, if i have cancer i need to know now. Please help.  ",17/6/2018 19:51
Useful links about low-risk and high-risk HPV infections,35,8dky9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/8dky9s/useful_links_about_lowrisk_and_highrisk_hpv/,18,1524227552,"**INTRODUCTION**

If you have HPV infection, then deep breath, calm down and don't panic. As CDC says: ""Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no symptoms. More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection"".

In general: 64% infections clear in 6 months, 80% infections clear in 12 months, 87% clear in 18 months and 91% clear in 24 months. Only a small % of people have persistent infection. It's also possible to have ""latent"" / ""dormant"" infection (in that case the virus is hiding from the immune system). While latent / dormant, the virus is inactive; it won't be detected by testing and will not spread or cause any problems.

If you have any ""basic"" questions about HPV then please read:

* https://www.mcgill.ca/traphpv/hpvfacts

* https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/parents/questions-answers.html

**WOMEN**

If you see some bumps in your vagina then please go to a gynecologist. Vestibular pappilomatosis looks similar to genital warts so it's easy for false-positives.

**MEN**

Circumcision won't protect you from HPV infections, however HPV infections on penis clear much faster if men are circumcised.

**GENERAL ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WITH HPV INFECTION**

* Avoid alcohol
* Don't smoke cigarettes / weed
* Eat healthy food
* Take a good multivitamin
* Vaccinate yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9. Vaccinate yourself especially if you are a male. Don't wait. Just do it.
* If you want to boost your immune system in the natural way then you can try medicinal mushrooms. https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/9lal33/medicinal_mushrooms_vs_hpv_and_other_diseases/
* AHCC is not a HPV killer. It's just an overpriced mushroom extract with weak clinical evidence (~20 women, ~50% clearance after 6 months, no control group to compare)

**GENERAL ADVICE FOR PEOPLE WITH GENITAL WARTS (LOW-RISK HPV)**

* External warts: cryotherapy (big warts), podophyllotoxin (small warts), imiquimod (+vaccine)
* Internal warts: cryotherapy (big warts), imiquimod (+vaccine)
* Be prepared for recurrences. As CDC says: ""Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%), whether clearance occurs spontaneously or following treatment""
* Combine topical treatment with Inosine Pranobex to avoid genital warts recurrences. For example: Cryotherapy + Inosine Pranobex pills or Podophyllotoxin + Inosine Pranobex pills. Search for ""Imunovir PDF"" and read the whole leaflet. You can print it and show it to your doctor. Consult using Inosine Pranobex with your doctor.
* Don't use ""home remedies"" like i.e. Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV), they can [cause chemical burns and scarring](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/8clx9y/apple_cider_vinegar_acv_and_chemical_burns/)
* Therapy available in China and Vietnam: photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT). You can read this post too: https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/9qibyr/im_nearing_the_end_hyperthermia_c02_laser_alapdt/
* There is a correlation between diabetes and genital warts recurrences. So uncontrolled diabetes means lots of genital warts and strong recurrences. Other causes for recurrences: HIV / immune deficiency / steroids / multiple HPV infection / smoking / heavy drinking.
* If you have recurrences for very long time (2 years or longer) and nothing really helps, then you can ask your doctor about Isotretinoin - but this is a very dangerous medicine and should be used only in extreme cases, under strict medical control. Another option is to save money, fly to China/Vietnam and get 4-5 photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) sessions. Unfortunately each session (10-15 minutes) can be painful. You can also check clinical study about Imuno BCG vs. recurrent genital warts.
* If you live in Russia then you can also try to lower genital warts recurrences with Panavir or Galavit.

**YOU AND YOUR SEXUAL PARTNER SHOULD VACCINATE YOURSELF TO AVOID AUTO-INOCULATION. YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM CAN CLEAR HPV INFECTION, BUT YOU CAN EASILY GET REINFECTED**

> A number of instances indicated apparent reinfection after viral clearance. In 1 couple (A), the womanŠ—Ès anus was positive for HPV 39 infection at baseline and at visit 2. By visit 3, HPV 39 had been transmitted to the manŠ—Ès scrotum, and the woman was negative for HPV 39. HPV 39 had been transmitted (presumably by auto-inoculation) to the penis by visit 4, and the infection remained through visit 5. By visit 6, or 9 months after initial clearance in the woman, HPV 39 had been transmitted to the womanŠ—Ès anus.

Should I wait for HPV vaccine?,4,8ktxq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/8ktxq5/should_i_wait_for_hpv_vaccine/,11,1526864942,"Hi! First things first, IŠ—Èm a 16 year old male, and my question is the title: Should I wait for the HPV vaccine? I just moved and got a new doctor, and in my first examination he naturally sent my parents out of the room to talk to me. Other than the usual, Š—“do you do drugs,Š— it was pretty standard except he stressed to me to wait until I get my HPV shot to become sexually active (IŠ—Èm not and I told him I wasnŠ—Èt). Like really stressed this to me.The only problem is I donŠ—Èt really know what he means by sexually active. Vaginal sex? Oral? Other stuff? Naturally I did some googling and IŠ—Èm seeing all sorts of stuff that says 78 million Americans have HPV and that it can be spread even through hand-to-genital contact. I guess first of all, are these media sites even truthful? But assuming they are, could my girlfriend or I even have HPV to give to the other? We are both virgins, and I know that the most either of us have done with another person is kissing. I donŠ—Èt know if shes had the vaccine or not, but IŠ—Èm open to asking if the scenario is that if sheŠ—Ès had it weŠ—Ère good. The main issue IŠ—Èm facing as far as waiting goes is that IŠ—Èm deathly afraid of needles, so my parents set up the appointment at some random time (probably within the next 6 months) that I donŠ—Èt know so that I canŠ—Èt dwell on it. So my final questions: Should I just wait for the HPV vaccine to be safe? Could I do oral or hand stuff?

Women Will Never Care About Men's Problems in the Sexual and Relationship Marketplaces. The Best Way For Men To Address This is to Stop Caring About Women's Problems in Society.,71,795jvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/795jvc/women_will_never_care_about_mens_problems_in_the/,298,1509162245,"So today we have a set of posts talking about men's problems in the SMP, and that women don't care.  We have the usual Blue and Non-Red complaints in response:

""Yeah, men have it hard.  What are we supposed to do about it?  Have sex with men we're not attracted to?""

""Men aren't entitled to sex.""

""This is something I just can't identify with.""

Well, in this one case, they're correct.  But, as usual, on the twice a day when their stopped clocks are right, they reached the right conclusion for the wrong reasons.  

Women are never going to care about men's problems in the SMP and RMP.   They won't care, because they (1) don't have to care in order to get their wants and needs met; and (2) they're completely unable to empathize with men about this.  Women cannot empathize with men *qua* men.   Women have no concept of ""men"".   Their only concepts of men are (a) men they're committed to/fucking/in a relationship with (i.e. ""Her Man""), (b) men they're sexually attracted to/want to fuck; and (c) males who are ignored if they're not being used or exploited for resource extraction or services (who aren't even really ""men"" to them).

Women aren't going to care about men's problems in the SMP/RMP.  Women aren't going to care about men's problems, period.   

In my opinion, the best way to address this is for men, individual men, to stop caring about women's problems and complaints.  Someone on another post said it pretty well (paraphrasing):  ""why should men care about alleged pay gaps and lack of relationships and ""rape culture""?""

 Men need to stop caring about women's problems.   

There is no reason for men to care about:

--sexual harassment policies or ""sexual harassment""

--alleged ""wage gaps""

--alleged ""rape culture""

--affirmative consent

--men threatening, victimizing or brutalizing women they have sex with

--women's health services and health issues:  Breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, HPV vaccines, public funding through Obamacare for birth control, abortion services

--women getting pumped and dumped

--women's inability to get a relationship from a sufficiently attractive man

--divorce and the alleged ""poverty"" issues it causes

--women getting raped

--women's fear of being attacked by men while in public and alone

--""domestic abuse""

--women's complaints about being accosted, talked to, hit on, chatted up, or otherwised ""gamed"" while in public

--women's complaints about ""mansplaining"", ""manspreading"", and other recently invented ""microaggressions""

Men should look out for themselves, to the detriment of everyone else.  Get what you want by any legal means necessary.  Defraud and deceive women.  Lie to them to get sex.  Promise them relationships, get what you want, then dump them.   If you want relationships, do not compromise.   Set down clear boundaries, and if she cannot or will not give you what you want and need, dump her.  If she complains, nags, threatens or bullies you, dump her.  If she starts conditioning sex, dump her.   If she doesn't give you sex on your timetable on your terms, dump her.   Proceed with extreme prejudice.    

Do not help women you're not related to, not having sex with, or not trying to have sex with.  Do not lift heavy objects for them at work.  Don't help subordinate women with tasks at work.  Ignore and avoid any requests for assistance at all times from any woman you're not related to or having sex with.   Don't stop to help a women with a disabled vehicle, flat tire, etc.  Don't intervene when you see a man ""abusing"" a woman.   Don't intervene if you see ""sexual harassment"", except to protect yourself or your employer.   

Do not engage women about ""women's issues"" in public.  Shut it down by saying ""nope.  Not going to talk about it or listen to it.""   

Men need to stop caring about women's problems.   They need to stop caring about women's complaints:  about them, about work, about life, about relationships or lack thereof, about alleged ""abuse"", about their imagined social issues, about their feelings and emotions.   Just stop caring about them.   Stop trying to help women.   Let women solve their own problems. Focus on your wants and needs, and solving your own problems.

How long until the HPV vaccine starts to become effective?,1,8t6iv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8t6iv4/how_long_until_the_hpv_vaccine_starts_to_become/,0,1529745969,"Male, 29, 5'8 140lbs, smoker, medications Adderall ER 25mg, Adderall IR 15mg, Wellbutrin 150mg, Nasocort 110mcg (seasonal)

Recently got my 2nd dose of Gardasil, approx 1 month after the initial dose. Even though I'm over the typical cutoff age, I opted to begin the vaccine schedule because A) I am non-monogamous and thus at a higher risk of exposure and transmission, and B) I have a romantic partner who has been diagnosed with multiple high risk strains of HPV. I have had genital warts in the past, symptoms appeared approx 4 months ago and subsided approx. 2 months ago.

What I want to know is when can I consider the Gardasil vaccination to be effective enough for myself and my HPV positive partner to have sex using barrier protection? 

She is aware of my status, and considering vaccination as well to prevent possibly getting a GW strain from me, or spreading it to other partners - although she's on the fence due to the negligible reduction in risk. She's a 31yo non-smoker, no medications that I know of, roughly average height and weight.

So, how long until I can have sex with her (using a condom) without risking getting a high risk strain, and if she opts to get the vaccine roughly how long until she can expect reasonable protection from my low-risk strain?",23/6/2018 17:26
Changing Gender in Norway.,22,7d7cv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/7d7cv6/changing_gender_in_norway/,71,1510809892,"Hi, I've been a lurker for some time, and mostly active in exclusively Norwegian gender politics, but I thought this might be of some interest to the sub. This is primarily a personal anecdote, so your mileage may vary, but I hope the gender politics of this might be interesting.

Up until September this year, I was a man. I have been happy with my body how it is, and though I'm not the very image of a gender conforming guy, I have experienced little in the way of dysphoria. Though I have been aware of one somewhat interesting thing in Norwegian law: The requirements to change your legal gender are very liberal.

That is, in order to change your gender, you fill out a statement that you feel like you are the opposite gender of what you were born as, then you fill out a confirmation of that form a few weeks later (and optionally a form to change your name, I didn't do this). Upon doing so, you will get a new Personal ID number (as Norwegian ID's are gendered) and you're free to be on your merry way. That's it, no doctors, no psychologists, no diagnosis, no transition, no sterilization (the previous rules mandated that an individual that wanted to change their gender first became infertile).

I am no proponent of a legal gender in the first place, and am principally opposed to any differential treatment that comes from your gender without solid reasoning (like cervical or prostate cancer scans). Additionally, I have observed that in some ways, legal discrimination that I find objectionable is happening. First, women get preferential treatment in applying to higher education in a wide array of fields, up until recently men received similar benefits (though for two specific courses at one specific school, pretty much one fiftieth of the coverage), this has been cut. Secondly, if you are a woman born before 1997, you have no duty to serve your country as military personell. Thirdly, if you are a woman born after 1991, you have a right to get a free vaccine against the HPV-virus, a virus that is known to increase instances of cancer among both men and women, but which men will have to pay upwards of 500$ to vaccinate against.

So, I decided to identify as a woman, filled in the necessary paper work, and I am now a woman. I'm getting my second (out of three) HPV shot tomorrow, I've renewed my passport and driver's license, I can no longer be drafted, though I have yet to take advantage of my educational benefits. In total, I'm just about 400$ on the plus side for what I've saved.

There are of course other benefits I will look forward to, I'm hoping to find some kind of establishment offering half-price drinks for women. Other benefits I'd like to try myself at would be attending a meeting at a women's student parliament, and voting in a women's day march meeting.

As a sidenote, I've got a wage higher than the average Norwegian woman, so I technically help closing the gender gap as well. So far I'm encouraging all my rich male friends to change their gender.

I'll take questions of course, and I'll try and offer some conversation starters too:

1. What do you think about legal gender?

2. What do you think about legal discrimination on gender?

3. Do you think someone would take offense to this?

3a. In that case, who?

4. Do you agree/disagree with the Norwegian legal definition where you are the gender you feel like, with no further requirements?

The Case for Male Circumcision,2,7yf5jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/7yf5jh/the_case_for_male_circumcision/,28,1518999016,"one thing that unites anti-Semites of the left-wing and right-wing variety is dislike of circumcising men. I am in favor of circumcision for two massive reasons:

**I**

The [benefits WAYYYY outweigh the bogus ""concerns"" about it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758146/)

>There is substantial evidence that circumcision protects males from HIV infection, penile carcinoma, urinary tract infections, and ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases. We could find little scientific evidence of adverse effects on sexual, psychological, or emotional health. Surgical risks associated with circumcision, particularly bleeding, penile injury, and local infection, as well as the consequences of the pain experienced with neonatal circumcision, are valid concerns that require appropriate responses.

[More](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684945/)

>There were no significant differences in male sexual satisfaction or dysfunction among trial participants, and in one trial, circumcised men reported increased penile sensitivity and enhanced ease of reaching orgasm.9 In addition, 97% of female partners reported either no change or improved sexual satisfaction after their male partner was circumcised...The evidence for the long-term public health benefits of male circumcision has increased substantially during the past 5 years. If a vaccine were available that reduced HIV risk by 60%, genital herpes risk by 30%, and HR-HPV risk by 35%, the medical community would rally behind the immunization and it would be promoted as a game-changing public health intervention. Based on the medical evidence, banning infant male circumcision would deprive parents of the right to act on behalf of their childrenŠ—Ès health.


**II** 

It being widespread in America, the only Christian majority country in which a majority of all men are circumcised, normalizes a Jewish tradition/practice. That is has been so widespread is indicative that Jewish ideas are accepted and embraced here, unlike in Europe. The continuation of this trend will further ensure the relative Jewish acceptance we have here that we don't elsewhere in the diaspora.

ENOUGH SAID. Anyone who, given the proven health benefits demonstrated by the best and most reputable sources, questions them, is basically an anti-Semite. The only alternative explanation they're left with is ""da Jooz control medicine.""

(26m) Should I get the HPV vaccine?,2,7t7lbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/7t7lbp/26m_should_i_get_the_hpv_vaccine/,17,1517028896,"Sex: Male

Age: 26

Height: 5' 6""

no known allergies

adenotonsillectomy at the age of about 6

&nbsp;

Hi. It has recently come to my attention that the HPV vaccine is still an option for me, so I was wondering if I should get it. I had figured that I was too old and that the vaccine was mostly for women, but apparently not. My insurance covers the vaccine for men and women through the age of 26.

I asked my doctor about the HPV vaccine but he was pretty ambivalent, and just said that I could get it if I wanted to. We've only met once, so he doesn't know me very well. Also, I don't know how familiar he is with the vaccine.

I understand that the vaccine is most effective before you're sexually active. I have not yet had sex (of any sort), so I figure I'm ok there. On the other hand, it seems that it's much more effective at younger ages, so I'm wondering if it's still worth it at my age.

One thing that came to mind was whether the age of first exposure to HPV would affect your body's ability to clear the infection. Might it be more important to get the vaccine if you're not going to have sex for the first time until you're in your late twenties (since, I think, your immune system is less responsive)?

I'm also wondering if having had an adenotonsillectomy would affect how important this vaccine would be for me.

My only hesitation is the very small risk of serious adverse reaction to the vaccine. No medication is 100% safe, and as I understand it, any infection (or perceived infection) has the potential to trigger an autoimmune response, including vaccines. I've also read, however, that ""wild"" viruses are more likely to do so than a vaccine, so there's may actually be an additional benefit there. Also, it seems that women are more prone to such responses given that their immune systems are more responsive? I know there's a very small risk of anything more than a sore arm, but I'm super risk-averse and prone to worrying. Plus, it just feels counter-intuitive to get an injection when you feel perfectly fine.

Basically, my question is: Should I get the vaccine?

But I'm also wondering if it makes more or less sense for me to get it given that:

Š—¢ I may be first exposed to HPV at a later age

Š—¢ I had my tonsils and adenoids removed when I was a kid

I have generally only had sex with women who probably did get Gardasil, but I did hook up with a 40 year old from Tinder last year.  I think it is unlikely she got Gardasil because it wasn't marketed when she was younger.

I am not sure if I have genital warts because I have nothing on or near my penis.  But I have a bump right underneath my stomach that is also near my pubic area.  It is somewhat reddish and small.

I am really anxious that this could be a wart, and I am afraid that if it is, I am stuck with warts for life.

There is a ton of conflicting evidence online.  A lot of places, including the CDC, state that HPV infections are cleared by close to 90% of people within two years.  Does this mean that genital warts are temporary conditions and not chronic?  Does this mean that the majority of people with genital warts only have them for about two years and never see them again.

I know this is definitely not the case with things like herpes.

I always use condoms and am very paranoid about STDs.  Going forward I may just try and hook up less on Tinder.

Here are the sources I was referencing:

(1) https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html: ""Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic, causing no symptoms. More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection.""

(2) https://www.mcgill.ca/hitchcohort/hpvfacts: ""Most HPV infections in young men and women are transient, lasting no more than one or two years. Usually, the body clears the infection on its own.""

(3) http://healthcenter.indiana.edu/answers/hpv.shtml: ""Luckily, most of the time our immune system is able to clear an HPV infection, even if it is a high risk strain. Studies suggest this process takes, on average, 18 months. Thus, for most people, an HPV infection is transient. Smoking specifically impairs the immune response to HPV, so it is particularly important for smokers to quit.""

(4) https://www.fpa.org.uk/sites/default/files/genital-warts-information-and-advice.pdf: ""Not everyone who has the virus develops genital warts.

Now, two months later, it is back.  Could this be a genital wart?  It is nowhere near my penis and in the hair above it.

If it is, is this a lifelong condition.  I have been doing some research that says it is not.  There seems to be a misconception that all viruses are lifelong conditions.

HIV and Herpes happen to be viruses that are lifelong conditions because have specific characteristics that allow them to hide in the body.

On the other hand, it seems that HPV (the virus that causes genital warts) is more akin to the common cold and the flu.  A lot of research shows that it goes away after a healthy immune system ""clears"" it in about 6 months to two years.  In fact, the fact that Gardasil and vaccines can completely prevent HPV from infecting someone is probably another form of evidence as to why antibodies can prevent future infection once the virus is cleared.

There are, however, a lot of sites that say that HPV is lifelong.  They seem to take this position because HPV ""cannot be cured.""  However, the flu ""cannot be cured"" either.  It can, however, be eliminated by the immune system so that it does not come back again.

Are there stories of people who have had recurring genital warts for more than two years?  If so, is this common?

If you are a New Zealander you can add your support by PMing me.

**TL;DR a letter asking for support followed by a submission to the UN asking them to recommend NZ report men's human rights.**


I am writing to ask you to support my submission to the UN Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights. My concern is that menŠ—Ès human rights issues are not being fully or accurately reported to the UN despite New ZealandŠ—Ès obligation to do so. Examples of this are included my following submission.

The Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights accepts reports from non-governmental organisations and individuals for consideration before they make their recommendations. Your support is important because submissions that have wide community support have more sway and are treated more respectfully.

If my submission is successful the committee will make a recommendation that New Zealand must report both menŠ—Ès and womenŠ—Ès issues equally. The government is then obligated to follow this recommendation and after the process is followed, menŠ—Ès human rights issues should be included in our National Plan of Action. This will be a significant step forward in addressing menŠ—Ès human rights and will support both our efforts to improve the lives of men in New Zealand.

To support my submission the least you could do is complete this boilerplate and return it to me via PM. Passing this request on to other interested parties will also help.

For individuals:

I, [Your Name], [Your Occupation], of [Your City], New Zealand support this submission for the Committee to recommend New Zealand report menŠ—Ès human rights issues in addition to womenŠ—Ès human rights issues.

If you represent an organisation.
[Your Organisation] of [Your City], New Zealand support this submission for the Committee to recommend New Zealand report menŠ—Ès human rights issues in addition to womenŠ—Ès human rights issues.

To more fully support my submission in addition to the above declaration you could write a short letter detailing issues you face that could be resolved or improved by having more attention on menŠ—Ès human rights.

Here is a brief explanation of the Covenant: The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is part of our international human rights framework. The Covenant covers things like labour rights, social security, family life, standards of living, health, education, and participation in cultural life. Importantly, the covenant is based on the idea of Š—…progressive realisationŠ—È which means the rights in the covenant are treated as goals to work towards. Countries must be working towards the goals and not implement any measures that work against them.

More info can be found here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Economic,_Social_and_Cultural_Rights

Full text of the covenant is here:
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CESCR.aspx

I hope you can find time among your current focus on achieving your organisationŠ—Ès goals to support my goals to improve the health and well being of men in New Zealand. Unfortunately, time is not on our side with the deadline for submissions being February 15th. I would apprentice it if you could respond to me by February 12th.

###Submission to UN ICESCR

Human rights can only be realised if they are protected and enforced. The human rights, health, and well being of New Zealanders rely on a having robust human rights framework. Identifying and improving weak points in our human rights reporting strengthens the whole system. Understanding what needs to be done, in the community, by the community, and for the community, comes from reporting full and accurate information.

New Zealand has not made full reports on both womenŠ—Ès and menŠ—Ès human rights issues to the committee, violating article 3 of the covenant. For example, New Zealand has not fully reported on boyŠ—Ès education, male domestic violence statistics and menŠ—Ès health. We would like the committee to recommend New Zealand abide by article 3 of the convention and fully report human rights issues facing men in addition to the human rights issues facing women.

*Boys education:*
The third report to the Committee identified areas where boys are falling behind in education, although under the heading Š—“Vulnerable and disadvantaged groups - Young womenŠ—. The fourth report limited discussion of educational achievements to Móori, Pasifika and disadvantaged students only, even though boys and men are still performing worse than girls and women at all levels. Gender equality in education is now an issue for boys and men. Currently, the NPA does not have any specific actions to address this educational disadvantage for boys and men.

*Partner Violence*
New Zealand has a problem with intimate partner violence. Both women and men are victims. The annual rate of intimate partner violence against men in 2015 was 4.4% (compared to 5.7% for women), making up 40% of the victims of intimate partner violence. New Zealand has not reported the number of male victims even though the source of their information contained these figures.1

Health:
There are also significant issues for men regarding health that should be reported to the committee.
Suicide is a particular problem for men. In New Zealand, men die from suicide at three times the rate of women. While our high rate of male suicide is recognised as a fact, there has been little attention paid to addressing male suicide specifically.2 3

Men also have high rates of injury. ACC and Statistics New Zealand report that men make up approximately three-quarters of injury claims. Incidents rates for injury claims have fallen slightly between 2002 and 2014. In 2014 men made up 94% of workplace fatalities.4

Additionally, Š—“[f]or every $1 the Health Research Council spends exclusively on womenŠ—Ès health, 6c goes to men.Š—5

New Zealand has not reported progress toward gender equality for boys and men either. For example, since the 1st of January 2017 boys became eligible for free human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccinations, making the vaccination scheme gender equal. Girls have had them since 2008.6

The Inclusion of menŠ—Ès human rights issues was raised with the Ministry of Justice when they asked for feedback on a draft of their report. However, the final report does a poor job in reporting menŠ—Ès human rights issues. The Ministry of Justice has not answered questions regarding reporting menŠ—Ès human rights issues in the final report.

The lack of full reporting of menŠ—Ès human rights issues has prevented the committee from considering the issues and deciding to make recommendations or not. With no recommendations from the committee, there is no chance for the issues incorporated into our national plan of action, and progress to improve those issues suffers as a result.

We have faith that once these menŠ—Ès human rights issues are fully included in the reporting, they will be addressed through current mechanisms and it will not be necessary for the people of New Zealand to raise individual issues with the committee.

Chemically Castrated Gender Bending Pesticides. Are Gays Naturally Born that Way?,0,7c7zm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/adventism/comments/7c7zm0/chemically_castrated_gender_bending_pesticides/,67,1510429669,"Edited to add [Born Gay? SDA ARTICLE](http://www.adventistsaffirm.org/article/80/previous-issues/volume-14-number-1/homosexuality-in-the-church-should-this-born-a-gay-lifestyle-be-baptized).
>Homosexuality in the Church: Should This ""Born-a-Gay"" Lifestyle Be Baptized?

by Samuel Koranteng-Pipim

>Why is homosexuality an Adventist ""hot potato""? Are there clear answers to the new interpretations of Scripture we are hearing?


All manner of sin can be forgiven, provided we admit our wrongdoing, repent, and turn away from it. But there can be no forgiveness when sinners are in denial--when they insist that their lustful desires and practices are not sinful, when they re-interpret Scripture to justify their sins, and when they defiantly maintain that they will not turn from their sinful ways.
Homosexuality Has Come to Church
Almost two decades ago, a former dean of the Theological Seminary at Andrews University perceptively noted: ""The gay crisis has come to church. Some homosexuals are coming to church not only for forgiveness and mercy but to say to the church, as they have to the world, `Homosexuality is not sinful; it is natural to me. God made me this way. He accepts me and my homosexuality as good. Therefore the time has come for the church to accept me as I am and join me in saying that gayness is good.'""1

The above statement aptly captures the essence of the ""born-a-gay gospel"" and its varied ""ministries"" or ""support groups.""2 Though advocates of this gospel employ the term ""ministry"" to describe their ""outreach"" to gay and lesbians, such ""ministries"" for the most part do not teach homosexuals to repent of their particular sin. Instead, they suggest that the church itself must be ""educated"" to own up to its ""immoral"" past, when it failed to ""understand"" and recognize homosexuality as a morally legitimate lifestyle. Regrettably, an increasing number of Christians are uncritically embracing this new ""gospel.""
The Changing Attitude Toward Homosexuality
Homosexuality is not a new sexual behavior that has suddenly burst upon our modern culture. The practice has been present in almost every human society. Not unexpectedly, the Bible also deals with the subject in such texts as Genesis 19 (cf. Jude 7; 2 Pet 2:6-10), Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, Romans 1:24-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, and 1 Timothy 1:8-11. If there is anything new about the practice of homosexuality, it lies in the fact that contrary to the church's response in the past, many churches in our day are accepting homosexuality as a morally legitimate lifestyle.
Even in our own Seventh-day Adventist church the attitudes of some are changing on the issue of homosexuality.



>Even though we may easily dismiss the above examples of allegedly healthy gay and lesbian relationships in the Bible as frivolous inventions, not all the arguments of pro-gay theology can be rebuffed so handily. Some of the arguments are quite sophisticated, often invoking scientific, philosophical, or logical arguments to show that (i) people are born homosexual (i.e., homosexuality is genetic or inborn); (ii) the sexual orientation of people ""born gay"" should be viewed as a natural or normal trait of their identity, like the color of the skin, eyes, or hair, or as a God-given gift; (iii) a person's ""God-given"" homosexual orientation is morally neutral and unchangeable; and (iv) the Bible is silent, or does not condemn, homosexuality as such, but only its abuse.
Sincere, Bible-believing Christians are often caught off-guard by the subtle and plausible-sounding arguments in favor of homosexuality today. In an effort to clear away the smoke-screen which often clouds this issue, I will list some of the arguments in circulation, following each with a response which I hope will make clear the fundamental issue at stake for the Christian. I believe that the reader will find in Scripture a clear and consistent guide to God's will in this highly-charged matter.
Because of space limitations I can only summarize and respond to some of the major arguments put forth by those attempting to reconcile the ""born a gay"" ideology with the Bible's ""born again"" theology. Those seeking a fuller discussion and documentation on the subject should consult my forthcoming book, Must We Be Silent? 

[Chemically Castrated](http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/). Gender Bending Pesticides. Are Gays Naturally Born that Way?

Increasingly, Adventist must deal with homosexuality in the church. Are we prepared to deal with those that claim that they were born that way? New Research into pesticides chemicals and vaccinations, inform us that the enemy is purposefully sewing and destroying seeds.

With the increasing number [of gays as SDA's, the church, the church finds itself trying to clearly articulate it's position on homosexuality.](https://www.adventist.org/en/information/official-statements/statements/article/go/-/same-sex-unions/).

>Homosexuality is a manifestation of the disturbance and brokenness in human inclinations and relations caused by the entrance of sin into the world. While everyone is subject to fallen human nature, ""we also believe that by God's grace and through the encouragement of the community of faith, an individual may live in harmony with the principles of God's Word"" (Seventh-day Adventist Position Statement on Homosexuality, 2012). 4

Homosexuals themselves try to use an emotional approach to a Biblical law. See this article entitled [Gays in the Family](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3071156). 
>Just sitting in the pews as an LGBT person can be one of the most uncomfortable situations of our lives, as weŠ—Ère spoken about in a theoretical and theological fashion, but seldom are we actually asked or allowed to share our perspective.

This is a method that is used to try to confuse the law abiding Christian. But when we can answer that the seed itself is being corrupted we can see that the law of God does not change and that we must fight back against the altering of people at the DNA level.

As a church, when we see  that vaccines, pesticides, and chemicals can alter more than our mood, we must now [reexamine how those that were ""born that way,"" were actually ""born that way!""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168220/).

HPV genital warts treatment & recurrences - guideline,7,7xy5jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/STD/comments/7xy5jf/hpv_genital_warts_treatment_recurrences_guideline/,0,1518809617,"**PROBLEM:**

> Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%)

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html

**Possible solutions:**

A. Check your glucose level and do HbA1c test. There is a correlation between GW recurrences and diabetes.

> Through clinical practice, it is often perceived that patients with diabetes are more likely to suffer from severe and recalcitrant warts. This study was set up to investigate if genital warts were more common in patients with diabetes and to determine if patients with diabetes and genital warts required more treatment than those without diabetes. Only female patients with diabetes and genital warts were investigated and were compared to the non-diabetic population. Results suggested that patients with diabetes had more extensive warts and recurrences. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20852193

B. Try antiviral herbs: Ellagic acid (i.e. from Pomegranate extract) and Annona Muricata extract. You can order EA+AM from iHerb.

> Ellagic acid (EA) and Annona Muricata (AM) have antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antiviral activity demonstrated by in vitro models. This pilot study investigated the in vivo potential anti-viral activity in women affected by Low squamous intraepithelial lesion (L-SIL) related to high risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV), and the ability to modify the oncoproteins expression in the cervical lesion thickness. Sixty women affected by HR-HPV related L-SIL, were randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 30) supplemented with EA (16 mg) + AM (100 mg) 2 times daily for 6 months and group B (n = 30) administered with placebo. HR-HPV clearance was obtained in 74% of cases in group A compared to 25% of cases in group B (p = 0.001) and p21 expression in LSIL thickness increased in 63.2% of cases in group A compared to 20% in group B (p = 0.03). AE/AM supplementation significantly induces HR-HPV elimination and stimulates p21 expression in LSIL thickness.

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464617303225

C. Try medicinal mushrooms: Coriolus Versicolor and Reishi. Only extracts are effective. Mushroom powders = placebo.

> This preliminary randomized study investigated the efficacy of medicinal mushrooms, Trametes versicolor (TV), Ganoderma lucidum (GL), and Laetiporus sulphureus (LS), on the clearance of oral human papillomavirus (HPV, serotypes 16 and 18). Among 472 patients who underwent oral swabs for gingivitis, 61 patients were positive for HPV16 or HPV18. Twenty patients were included in group 1 (LS) and 41 patients were included in group 2 (TV+GL) for 2 months. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV was performed at inclusion and after 2 months. In group 1, the clearance was equal to 5% after 2 months of treatment. In group 2, the clearance was equal to 88% (P<0.001). The detection of HPV16 or HPV18 could become relevant in routine since positivity is frequent and because a harmless and costless treatment may exist. The use of TV+GL for the clearance of oral HPV deserves further investigation.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25271984#

D. Combine Cryotherapy or Podophyllotoxin with Panavir, antiviral gel made in Russia. You can order Panavir from online pharmacies.

> The article presents the results of treatment of 51 men with recurrent genital HPV infection in the form of genital warts. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the treatment. Group 1 of patients has received the combination treatment--electrocoagulation + pharmacotherapy (panavir intravenously and topically in the form of a gel), Group 2 of patients--only electrocoagulation. According to the results of follow-up within 6 months, disease recurrence rate was significantly higher in Group 2--39.5% versus 9.6% in the Group 1. Postoperative complications were also more frequently recorded in the Group 2. These findings suggest that the combined treatment of reccurent forms of genital warts is preferred than just using destructive methods of treatment.

http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/24649765

> This research is devoted to determination of the clinical efficacy of Panavir in the combined therapy of the uterine cervix diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). The article presents data of the complex examination of 59 patients. Patients with diagnosed 16th, 18th, 31st, 33rd types of HPV underwent destructive methods of treatment of the cervix followed by Panavir. The efficacy of Panavir was estimated by PCR in 3, 6 and 12 months from the beginning of treatment and it was 84,7%. Antiviral therapy permits to prevent recurrence of papillomavirus infection of the cervix uteri.

http://journals.rudn.ru/medicine/article/view/3463

E. Try Solanum incanum extract, SR-T100 gel.

> In this pilot study of condyloma treatment, 19 (73%) of 26 patients using the SR-T100 gel (2.3% solamargine in Solanum incanum plant extract) exhibited a response, and 16 (61.5%) patients achieved total clearance. In addition, only one patient showed a severe (grade 3-4) skin-related side effect. Although an extract of Solanum dulcamara L. has been reported in folk medicine to treat warts, this is the first reported trial of the use of solamargine to treat condyloma.

https://transmedcomms.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41231-017-0017-5

F. Combine Cryotherapy or Podophyllotoxin with Inosine Pranobex (3g daily, 14-28 days)

> This study evaluates the effectiveness of immunomodulating drug isoprinosine in a comprehensive treatment of genital warts in men. Most of the patients were aged 20-30 years. The combination therapy was found to have long term effectiveness. In the group of patients undergoing only destructive methods of treatment relapse after 8 month follow-up was diagnosed in 32% and in patients of the combination therapy group (destruction plus isoprinosine) - in 7% of patients. The pharmacological action of the drug (immunostimulating, antiviral) and the effectiveness of its combination with destructive therapies justify the use of inosine pranobex (isoprinosine) both in the complex therapy of genital warts and for the prevention of the disease recurrence.

**AT THIS MOMENT I THINK THAT COMBINED THERAPY WITH INOSINE PRANOBEX IS A VERY GOOD WAY TO AVOID GENITAL WARTS RECURRENCES**

G. Combine Imiquimod with Gardasil / Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine. Imiquimod / Aldara is not very effective in males, but it seems that Imiquimod + full vaccination is much more effective.

> The study comprised 36 patients, including 22 men, aged 26.4+/-4.1 years, who had from 1 to 5 anogenital warts. Participants of the study were vaccinated by quadrivalent recombinant vaccine under a 3-dose scheme 0-2-6 months co-administered with imiquimod 5% cream three times per week up to 16 weeks. The follow-up period was 2 years. Complete disappearance of genital warts within 1 year from baseline was observed in 34 (94.4%) patients. Two patients with anogenital warts after 1 year were treated for 1 year 3 months and 1 year and 4 months with Solcoderm which lead to the complete disappearance of genital warts. There were no recurrences of genital warts during the 2 years of follow-up.

H. Try to get local hyperthermia (44 celsius degrees for 50-60 minutes)

> Local hyperthermia has been successfully used in the treatment of viral warts by mechanisms that have largely remained unclear. Using an organotypic culture system, we found that hyperthermia at 42 ÎçC and 45 ÎçC could induce a significant increase in the transcriptional expression of interferon (IFN)-Ô±, IFN-Ô_ and IFN-Ô_, in a temperature-dependent manner in condyloma acuminata (CA), but not in normal skin. Accordingly, local hyperthermia could enhance the expression of 2Š—_-5Š—_ oligoadenylate synthase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase, two antiviral enzymes downstream of the IFN-dependant pathway.

I. Vaccine yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9.  They are not therapeutic vaccines but...

>  Background: Various therapeutic modalities have been implemented for wart treatment. Recently, resistant warts treated using quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine have been reported, although original articles on the efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine on viral warts are rare. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the treatment of multiple warts Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients with multiple warts who had been treated with quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Pusan National University Hospital from January 2014 to November 2016. All patients received 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine at baseline, 2 and 6 months. Patient demographics and clinical features were reviewed. Therapeutic response and adverse reactions following vaccination were assessed. Results: Regarding therapeutic response, 14 patients (46.67%) showed Š—“Complete responseŠ—, 5 (16.67%) showed Š—“Partial responseŠ—, and 11 (36.67%) showed Š—“No responseŠ—. There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, disease duration, and lesion number and location between the three groups divided by treatment response. No severe adverse events were noted. Conclusion: The advantage of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the treatment of multiple warts is that it is more convenient and less painful. HPV vaccine might be a good alternative to conventional destructive methods for certain cases such as those including multiple warts, dangerous lesion locations, and uncooperative patients.

Redpiller starts to suspect something [x-post /r/PurplePillDebate],24,799jyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/799jyg/redpiller_starts_to_suspect_something_xpost/,6,1509217582,"So today we have a set of posts talking about men's problems in the SMP, and that women don't care. We have the usual Blue and Non-Red complaints in response:

""Yeah, men have it hard. What are we supposed to do about it? Have sex with men we're not attracted to?""

""Men aren't entitled to sex.""

""This is something I just can't identify with.""

Well, in this one case, they're correct. But, as usual, on the twice a day when their stopped clocks are right, they reached the right conclusion for the wrong reasons.

Women are never going to care about men's problems in the SMP and RMP. They won't care, because they (1) don't have to care in order to get their wants and needs met; and (2) they're completely unable to empathize with men about this. Women cannot empathize with men *qua* men. Women have no concept of ""men"". Their only concepts of men are (a) men they're committed to/fucking/in a relationship with (i.e. ""Her Man""), (b) men they're sexually attracted to/want to fuck; and (c) males who are ignored if they're not being used or exploited for resource extraction or services (who aren't even really ""men"" to them).

Women aren't going to care about men's problems in the SMP/RMP. Women aren't going to care about men's problems, period.

In my opinion, the best way to address this is for men, individual men, to stop caring about women's problems and complaints. Someone on another post said it pretty well (paraphrasing): ""why should men care about alleged pay gaps and lack of relationships and ""rape culture""?""

Men need to stop caring about women's problems.

There is no reason for men to care about:

--sexual harassment policies or ""sexual harassment""

--alleged ""wage gaps""

--alleged ""rape culture""

--affirmative consent

--men threatening, victimizing or brutalizing women they have sex with

--women's health services and health issues: Breast cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, HPV vaccines, public funding through Obamacare for birth control, abortion services

--women getting pumped and dumped

--women's inability to get a relationship from a sufficiently attractive man

--divorce and the alleged ""poverty"" issues it causes

--women getting raped

--women's fear of being attacked by men while in public and alone

--""domestic abuse""

--women's complaints about being accosted, talked to, hit on, chatted up, or otherwised ""gamed"" while in public

--women's complaints about ""mansplaining"", ""manspreading"", and other recently invented ""microaggressions""

Men should look out for themselves, to the detriment of everyone else. Get what you want by any legal means necessary. Defraud and deceive women. Lie to them to get sex. Promise them relationships, get what you want, then dump them. If you want relationships, do not compromise. Set down clear boundaries, and if she cannot or will not give you what you want and need, dump her. If she complains, nags, threatens or bullies you, dump her. If she starts conditioning sex, dump her. If she doesn't give you sex on your timetable on your terms, dump her. Proceed with extreme prejudice.

Do not help women you're not related to, not having sex with, or not trying to have sex with. Do not lift heavy objects for them at work. Don't help subordinate women with tasks at work. Ignore and avoid any requests for assistance at all times from any woman you're not related to or having sex with. Don't stop to help a women with a disabled vehicle, flat tire, etc. Don't intervene when you see a man ""abusing"" a woman. Don't intervene if you see ""sexual harassment"", except to protect yourself or your employer.

Do not engage women about ""women's issues"" in public. Shut it down by saying ""nope. Not going to talk about it or listen to it.""

Men need to stop caring about women's problems. They need to stop caring about women's complaints: about them, about work, about life, about relationships or lack thereof, about alleged ""abuse"", about their imagined social issues, about their feelings and emotions. Just stop caring about them. Stop trying to help women. Let women solve their own problems. Focus on your wants and needs, and solving your own problems.

Challenge my view. Is this the solution? Is there a better solution? Is this even workable? Is there a solution at all?

 She says she had noticed one of them a few years before becoming sexually active, but not the others on the outer labia  nor the smaller one on the inner labia until I said something.. She says the big one appeared after having a bad pimple that she popped in 2014. Again, she only noticed one of the warts and didnŠ—Èt realize there were more until I said something a few days ago.

Earlier tonight we visited a clinic and the doctor had a look. The doctor did a visual examination and used my girlfriends backstory to come up with her diagnoses. Her conclusion was that they were warts but Š—…not caused by HPVŠ—È somehow because she hadnŠ—Èt had any sexual experiences prior to their development. She also said the warts looked to be no longer active and so not contagious. She said they could no longer spread. The smaller one on the inner labia, however, the doctor said could be HPV or it could have formed from recent irritation (a lot of sex the last 3 weeks), but she wasnŠ—Èt sure.

How much of this is accurate? Can a wart be caused by something other than HPV? Can genital warts be caught through non sexual means? Can a wart be present but the virus itself dead and not contagious? If so, how can a doctor be sure by visual examination? 

I myself received the HPV4  vaccine back in 2014, this means IŠ—Èm immune to HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, correct?

Also, is there anything I can do preemptively to combat the possible HPV infection I may or may not have gotten? IŠ—Ève had a hard time clearing warts on my feet so I donŠ—Èt trust my immune system to do itŠ—Ès job in fending the virus itself.

My wife and I just started dipping our toes in this world. So far we both enjoy it. We had some social interactions at events, played between us in front of others and had some really nice cyber dates. Going on a real date feels like a natural progression.

We find it hard though to overcome the fear of STDs. In our twenties neither of us were thinking about it too much, but I guess age (we're in our 30s), family and having to deal with (unrelated) health issues make you feel more aware and responsible. The thought that either of us might get something from this that ends up affecting our health irremediably scares us.

The more research we do, the more confused we become. There are things you can get for which you can't even get tested (e.g. HPV in males). Some studies show prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea in swingers being at 15% (!). Even if you trust someone, people can have things without knowing. I read one experienced swinger on a board saying that regardless how safe you play, it's not a matter of ""if"", but of ""when"" you'll be getting something. That didn't sound encouraging.

At first we thought soft swap might be safer, but then I found out about all the things that you can get from unprotected oral sex (and ""dental dams"" seem weird to me). Is full-swap with condoms in fact the safest thing? Is there any way to know that? We can't find data on risk distribution. From what I've researched so far, only touching and mutual masturbation are (almost) risk-free, but I can see how most swingers find that too limiting.

Are there any community standards around this topic, besides ""use condoms"" and ""test often""? Some people do vaccines, do they help? Are there any other proven helpful practices?

I realize there's no magic pill to solve all the risks and I get the idea of tradeoffs. I know there's risk involved in any reward. I guess I'm looking for some more clear insights, best practices and reassurance from more experienced health-conscious swingers. Thank you.",22/7/2017 0:31

Results suggested that patients with diabetes had more extensive warts and recurrences.

B. Try antiviral herbs: Ellagic acid (i.e. from Pomegranate extract) and Annona Muricata extract. You can order EA+AM from iHerb.

> Ellagic acid (EA) and Annona Muricata (AM) have antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antiviral activity demonstrated by in vitro models. This pilot study investigated the in vivo potential anti-viral activity in women affected by Low squamous intraepithelial lesion (L-SIL) related to high risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV), and the ability to modify the oncoproteins expression in the cervical lesion thickness. Sixty women affected by HR-HPV related L-SIL, were randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 30) supplemented with EA (16 mg) + AM (100 mg) 2 times daily for 6 months and group B (n = 30) administered with placebo. HR-HPV clearance was obtained in 74% of cases in group A compared to 25% of cases in group B (p = 0.001) and p21 expression in LSIL thickness increased in 63.2% of cases in group A compared to 20% in group B (p = 0.03). AE/AM supplementation significantly induces HR-HPV elimination and stimulates p21 expression in LSIL thickness.

C. Try medicinal mushrooms: Coriolus Versicolor and Reishi. Only extracts are effective. Mushroom powders = placebo.

> This preliminary randomized study investigated the efficacy of medicinal mushrooms, Trametes versicolor (TV), Ganoderma lucidum (GL), and Laetiporus sulphureus (LS), on the clearance of oral human papillomavirus (HPV, serotypes 16 and 18). Among 472 patients who underwent oral swabs for gingivitis, 61 patients were positive for HPV16 or HPV18. Twenty patients were included in group 1 (LS) and 41 patients were included in group 2 (TV+GL) for 2 months. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV was performed at inclusion and after 2 months. In group 1, the clearance was equal to 5% after 2 months of treatment. In group 2, the clearance was equal to 88% (P<0.001). The detection of HPV16 or HPV18 could become relevant in routine since positivity is frequent and because a harmless and costless treatment may exist. The use of TV+GL for the clearance of oral HPV deserves further investigation.

D. Combine Cryotherapy or Podophyllotoxin with Panavir, antiviral gel made in Russia. You can order Panavir from online pharmacies.

> The article presents the results of treatment of 51 men with recurrent genital HPV infection in the form of genital warts. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the treatment. Group 1 of patients has received the combination treatment--electrocoagulation + pharmacotherapy (panavir intravenously and topically in the form of a gel), Group 2 of patients--only electrocoagulation. According to the results of follow-up within 6 months, disease recurrence rate was significantly higher in Group 2--39.5% versus 9.6% in the Group 1. Postoperative complications were also more frequently recorded in the Group 2. These findings suggest that the combined treatment of reccurent forms of genital warts is preferred than just using destructive methods of treatment.

http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/24649765

> This research is devoted to determination of the clinical efficacy of Panavir in the combined therapy of the uterine cervix diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). The article presents data of the complex examination of 59 patients. Patients with diagnosed 16th, 18th, 31st, 33rd types of HPV underwent destructive methods of treatment of the cervix followed by Panavir. The efficacy of Panavir was estimated by PCR in 3, 6 and 12 months from the beginning of treatment and it was 84,7%. Antiviral therapy permits to prevent recurrence of papillomavirus infection of the cervix uteri.

E. Try Solanum incanum extract, SR-T100 gel.

> In this pilot study of condyloma treatment, 19 (73%) of 26 patients using the SR-T100 gel (2.3% solamargine in Solanum incanum plant extract) exhibited a response, and 16 (61.5%) patients achieved total clearance. In addition, only one patient showed a severe (grade 3-4) skin-related side effect. Although an extract of Solanum dulcamara L. has been reported in folk medicine to treat warts, this is the first reported trial of the use of solamargine to treat condyloma.

F. Combine Cryotherapy or Podophyllotoxin with Inosine Pranobex (3g daily, 14-28 days)

> This study evaluates the effectiveness of immunomodulating drug isoprinosine in a comprehensive treatment of genital warts in men. Most of the patients were aged 20-30 years. The combination therapy was found to have long term effectiveness. In the group of patients undergoing only destructive methods of treatment relapse after 8 month follow-up was diagnosed in 32% and in patients of the combination therapy group (destruction plus isoprinosine) - in 7% of patients. The pharmacological action of the drug (immunostimulating, antiviral) and the effectiveness of its combination with destructive therapies justify the use of inosine pranobex (isoprinosine) both in the complex therapy of genital warts and for the prevention of the disease recurrence.

G. Combine Imiquimod with Gardasil / Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine. Imiquimod / Aldara is not very effective in males, but it seems that Imiquimod + full vaccination is much more effective.

> The study comprised 36 patients, including 22 men, aged 26.4+/-4.1 years, who had from 1 to 5 anogenital warts. Participants of the study were vaccinated by quadrivalent recombinant vaccine under a 3-dose scheme 0-2-6 months co-administered with imiquimod 5% cream three times per week up to 16 weeks. The follow-up period was 2 years. Complete disappearance of genital warts within 1 year from baseline was observed in 34 (94.4%) patients. Two patients with anogenital warts after 1 year were treated for 1 year 3 months and 1 year and 4 months with Solcoderm which lead to the complete disappearance of genital warts. There were no recurrences of genital warts during the 2 years of follow-up.

H. Try to get local hyperthermia (44 celsius degrees for 50-60 minutes)

> Local hyperthermia has been successfully used in the treatment of viral warts by mechanisms that have largely remained unclear. Using an organotypic culture system, we found that hyperthermia at 42 ÎçC and 45 ÎçC could induce a significant increase in the transcriptional expression of interferon (IFN)-Ô±, IFN-Ô_ and IFN-Ô_, in a temperature-dependent manner in condyloma acuminata (CA), but not in normal skin. Accordingly, local hyperthermia could enhance the expression of 2Š—_-5Š—_ oligoadenylate synthase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase, two antiviral enzymes downstream of the IFN-dependant pathway.

I. Vaccine yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9.  They are not therapeutic vaccines but...

>  Background: Various therapeutic modalities have been implemented for wart treatment. Recently, resistant warts treated using quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine have been reported, although original articles on the efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine on viral warts are rare. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the treatment of multiple warts Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients with multiple warts who had been treated with quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Pusan National University Hospital from January 2014 to November 2016. All patients received 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine at baseline, 2 and 6 months. Patient demographics and clinical features were reviewed. Therapeutic response and adverse reactions following vaccination were assessed. Results: Regarding therapeutic response, 14 patients (46.67%) showed Š—“Complete responseŠ—, 5 (16.67%) showed Š—“Partial responseŠ—, and 11 (36.67%) showed Š—“No responseŠ—. There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, disease duration, and lesion number and location between the three groups divided by treatment response. No severe adverse events were noted. Conclusion: The advantage of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the treatment of multiple warts is that it is more convenient and less painful. HPV vaccine might be a good alternative to conventional destructive methods for certain cases such as those including multiple warts, dangerous lesion locations, and uncooperative patients.

Help me with an insecurity/HPV,0,7j3u4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7j3u4w/help_me_with_an_insecurityhpv/,4,1513043507,"Hi guys. I have kind of a strange question/concern that I'm hoping the good people of r/sex can help me with. I'm male, early-mid twenties, and currently struggling with a nagging concern in the back of my mind.

I'm a very analytical and risk-averse sort of person, and for me the idea of getting an STD has always been horrifying. (By no means do I wish to offend anyone who has an incurable STD, I am simply stating my own feelings which may/may not be entirely rational. Nevertheless, it is important for context to understand that I am exceedingly averse to contracting one myself.)

As a result of this attitude among other reasons, I have restricted my sexual activities over the course of my life, never allowing/choosing for myself to behave particularly promiscuously. (While you'll have to take my word for it, I should also probably say that I don't believe I am unattractive, in fact I would likely be considered fairly good-looking by most standards). Still, I have never had a one night stand. And when single I would always turn down the offers of women who I did not know (well-enough) who wished to engage in sexual activities. Why is this? I couldn't quite say, except that the idea of sleeping with someone I don't know seems quite unappealing, even scary. It has always seemed like I am in the minority among men, and my unwillingness to be casually intimate with women often results in my masculinity or maturity being impugned somehow. 

I also wish to clarify one more thing for context, but I am concerned that if mis-read, I will become the target of a certain amount of negativity. Basically, I find too much promiscuity (in others) to be unattractive. 

Before you bring out the pitchforks, I would NEVER treat someone poorly or even differently after learning of their sexual past. Really. I promise. Really really.

I simply find it unattractive for me !personally! (emphasis on personally, largely due to an increased risk of STDs). 
The number of partners itself matters little, except in terms of how it relates to their past behavior. (i.e. having sex with lots of people in a short time is worse to me than having lots of sex with a few people over a long time). 
I realize this is not entirely rational, and may even be some type of compulsive thought, but it is how I feel.
 For example, I will even be less willing to share a beverage from the same glass (as often happens socially) with someone who I know is very promiscuous. Don't get me wrong, I would never create an awkward situation or let someone know they had made me feel this way, but I must admit that the aversion exists. 

I also DO NOT have a double standard, this applies equally to men as well as women, especially in the exact example of the drinking-aversion I described above. It also only applies to how I feel INTERNALLY, and is NOT how I socialize. I have male and female friends who have LOTS of sex with different people, they are still my friends and our friendship has no relevance or correlation to their sexual activities. I also have friends (male and female) who are sexually conservative. Basically what I'm saying is, I don't consider myself sex-negative really at all, so much as hyper-concerned with how sex might vector diseases. I'm fairly liberal and progressive, non-religious, and I don't view sex in a moral context at all really, merely a biological one.

 I apologize for my lengthy exposition, I simply wish for you to understand where I'm coming from before I get to the crux of the issue. 

Basically, I'm hoping you can help me decide if it is worthwhile for me to go through the expense and trouble of getting the HPV vaccine as a male. 

As I said, I'm analytical, so I felt the best way of approaching this was to try and calculate the odds that I have already been exposed. I have had one sexual partner in my lifetime, and she is also the only woman who has ever given me oral or manual stimulation. So basically, if I have contracted anything, it is almost certainly from her. We have been very happy in a long term monogamous relationship for the last three years. She herself had six sexual partners prior to me, and sexual contact with eight individuals total if you include oral, etc. I understand that HPV can stay in someone's system without presenting symptoms, and also that it can go away on its own after two to three years, so with that in mind I can provide a bit of longitudinal data. I have no desire to grill her for more precise details, since that would be rude, but this is all the information I already possess.
Two to three of her sexual partners were within a year prior to my first getting involved with her, with the others spread out over her seven year sexual history before meeting me. She has never presented any symptoms of HPV nor tested positive, though I also understand that HPV is frequently left out of standard screenings because of the high incidence rate. She took the virginity of at least one, potentially two of the past partners mentioned (three if you include me), so they can likely be excluded as potential vectors. That said, neither of those were the more recent partners, who are therefore relatively more high-risk as a function of having likely had more partners themselves.

With those odds, do you think it is likely I have already been exposed or no? I understand that due to my gender and age, I may be unable to get the vaccine without paying out of pocket since it is unlikely to be covered by my insurance, so it wouldn't be a casual investment. If I was still HPV-free for certain, I would undoubtedly get the vaccine for the peace of mind of knowing I was protected. However, since my exposure status is in question, I am not certain I can justify the expense.

So what do you all think? Should I get it? Or is it likely I've already been exposed through my partner?

Part of me is thinking that the vaccine is worthwhile due to the fact that there are different strains, and the vaccine will have protective benefits for any of the most high risk types that I haven't been exposed already. 

I feel that while it is unlikely my exposure is zero due to my SO having had six past partners (while it varies among age groups, common sources say as many as one in four has HPV), then even if I have already contracted one or two varieties I should still protect myself from the others, no? What do you guys think?

How to afford regular STI testing and prevention? I am broke and my insurance is awful / nonexistent.,1,7bjqie,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7bjqie/how_to_afford_regular_sti_testing_and_prevention/,6,1510153648,"I am a 45-year-old heteroflexible guy who would like to begin regularly having ethically nonmonogamous sex with multiple partners.  I've been lurking on the edges of the poly world for three years, and am ready to take a deeper dive.  Ideally I see myself with two or three regular female partners, and one regular oral-only male partner.  I may also want to participate in some MFM, MMF, and MMFM scenarios.

I do plan to use condoms for all penetrative sex.  I would really rather not use them for giving or receiving oral.  I plan to discuss testing history with my partners, but I can't depend on that to protect me entirely.  When you're poly and sleeping with other poly people, that's a pretty big network that some sort of bug could spread around.

Before I do this, I want to have a plan in place for regular STI testing and prevention.  My thinking is that at minimum I should get tested every three months for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, trich, and chlamydia.  I've also considered whether it makes sense to get Hepatitis B and HPV vaccines (thought most providers will not give the latter to anyone over 26).

Right now I have some really crappy short-term insurance plan that doesn't cover much of anything.  I'm in the process of signing up for ACA coverage through Healthcare.gov.  I'll have to get the cheapest Bronze plan, which looks like it's going to run me around $330/mo.  After paying for insurance, I'm not going to have much money left over.  I make about $39K/year, but most of that is going to debt repayment at the moment.  So, I'm on a pretty tight budget.

I know that ACA health insurance covers some STI screening, but is it really going to cover me if I ask for a full panel of tests every three months?  If I explain my nonmonogamous activity to my primary care doctor, is he likely to order the tests?  (I'm pretty open with my doc, but I feel weird about telling him that I have sex with lots of men and women.)

My local county health department offers free HIV screening, but there is no other free testing available in my area.  If my health insurance won't cover it, I'll have to pay for the remaining tests out of pocket.  I've shopped around, and I'm looking at $210 for each set of tests.  I'm sort of embarrassed to say it, but I can't swing that.  With all the debt I'm paying down, I can't even afford a car at the moment.

Does my proposed screening regimen make sense?  Should I get the additional vaccinations?  Does anyone have any experience getting frequent STI screening through ACA health insurance?  Any tips for how I can get the tests out of pocket for less than $210?",8/11/2017 23:07
The OB/GYN that ruined my life [rant],354,3s89ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/3s89ek/the_obgyn_that_ruined_my_life_rant/,249,1447156641,"This is gonna sound like it doesn't relate to childfree, but it does. Just hang on until the end, okay?

I've been using the same OB/GYN since about... 2012 I think? At first she seemed very nice and always explained exactly what she was doing during my annual exam. Not to mention she was very gentle and made sure I was never in any pain. Well, after expressing my interest in being childfree, that all came to a stop.

I was originally told I was not a good candidate for anything permanent. When I asked why, she just repeated the ""not being a good candidate"" comment as if she didn't understand my question. To prevent me from asking again, she started harping on the HPV vaccine. She insisted that I get it immediately, because my age put me at a high risk for cancer-causing HPV strains. After having a friend that had a bad reaction to the vaccine and hearing some of the horror stories, I have opted not to get it. I'm not anti-vax AT ALL, but this is one I decided not to get because I don't feel that it's as safe as doctors claim. But that's another discussion for another day.

Anyways, fast forward to my annual exam this summer. Third time being rejected for anything permanent. This time I asked for an IUD, fully planning on putting my foot down and getting one. She scoffed, yup SCOFFED at me. She said that since I had not had children, I would not be able to handle the pain of insertion. I told her I didn't care how much it hurt and I didn't care about the severe cramping afterwards, I wanted something long term so I wouldn't have to deal with remember patches/pills/rings. Depo shot was out of the question, it's just not for me! She gave me a pamphlet on the IUD and a pamphlet on the implant (Nexplanon?) and said that I could look over the IUD one if I wanted, but she insisted she would not do it because ""you would spend so much money to only have it in for a couple months and then take it out because it's too painful. It would be a waste of your money."" Those are very close to her exact words. I was so shocked I couldn't speak. She then went on to explain that the implant would be the best long term option for me (sorry, but how would she know?) and that she would be more than happy to check if my insurance covered it. I told her simply, no. I haven't gotten the tattoo I wanted on that arm yet and I really didn't want an implant in my arm. The whole idea felt uncomfortable and made my skin crawl. I once again insisted ""I want an IUD"". She then told me that the fact that I fidget and squirm while getting my annual exam made her think I wouldn't even be able to go through with insertion. Well, of course I squirm during my annual. Someone has their finger in my vag and I didn't really give them enthusiastic consent to be there. She then went on to explain that most women that are sterilized go back on birth control to regulate their cycle anyways, so there was no point in me trying for something permanent. Actually, I'd stay on birth control to regulate my cycle, but I'd like to make sure I'm not reproducing due to that small percentage chance of a fluke.

I left instead with a script for the Nuvaring. So far, so good, but I still want something permanent. I've already forgotten about my ring and left it in too long. About a week or so after that pap, I got a call at work. Yup, at work. ""You need to come in immediately to discuss the results of your pap. It's very abnormal and you are positive for HPV."" I flipped. I cried. I was opening my store and in tears. I asked for more information, the nurse just told me I needed to come in and that she was not going to give me further information. I needed to schedule my biopsy immediately. No consultation, just come in for a cervical biopsy. In my panic state, I scheduled one for the following week.

My fiance and I were escorted into an ultrasound room which I guess doubled as an exam/procedure room. I followed the instructions of stripping from the waist down and got onto the exam table/chair/bed/whatever. He had to be seated on the other side of the room. In front of me, I had a beautiful view of a rolling table covered in metal instruments and bottles of various solutions. The doctor came in and started talking about HPV and how this could have been prevented had I gotten the vaccine. It then dawned on me. This sounded like a scare tactic. I immediately asked if I could be given a copy of my pap results. She told me ""absolutely not, we don't give those out"". I was stunned once again. You can't give me the results of my own pap? Are you kidding me? I asked her how I could have gotten HPV if I only had one partner for many years. She said I could have gotten it at any point in my life without having it flare up. She could not tell what type/strain of HPV I had, how severe it was, nothing. She insisted she could not tell me any information about it. She said that most likely my fiance had it, but he would not need treatment. It apparently doesn't affect males at all. And, according to her, he would not be a threat to me getting reinfected. None of that made sense but again, she refused to elaborate and began the procedure. This is where it gets a bit TMI if you don't want to read further.

She took a look at my cervix with some special camera and flashlight. ""Everything looks perfectly normal! I don't see anything visibly wrong!"" Great! That's fantastic! ""So I don't need the biopsy done?"" I ask, excited to get up and leave. ""No, we need to be sure. I'm just going to take a piece of your cervix. You'll feel a pinch and a lot of cramping. Then the iodine solution will burn but it'll make you clot so you don't bleed out."" If everything is normal, why are you in there taking pieces of my body out? Get out of there.

My fiance was told that he could not hold my hand and could not come over to the exam area. He had to sit on the other side of the room and watch me cry, plead the doctor to stop, cry some more, and go into a full blown anxiety attack. Did I mention I was crying? I had gripped my head so hard that I had nail marks all over my face. I had never experienced so much pain in my life. The burning of the iodine solution caused me to squirm and writhe in pain. My fiance had his hand over his mouth and I could see tears in his eyes. He had to sit there and literally watch me be tortured. The doctor asked if I was able to sit or stand. I told her no through my tears. I was cramping harder than when I had a pill-induced abortion. She said that when I was ready, I needed to sit up and get dressed. But I needed to meet her by the front desk. I tried so hard to sit up but the pain smacked me down each time. I eventually asked my fiance to come help me up. He held onto me while I tried to get dressed. I started crying full force again. Standing, moving, bending... I couldn't do any of it. He had to help me get dressed and walk me to the front desk. The doctor was nowhere to be find. Apparently I had taken too long and she went on to the next patient. The nurse at the front desk gave me the aftercare instructions and asked me if I wanted to schedule my follow-up pap. I told her no, that I would not be able to get the time off of work because November was a black out month. No requests, no exceptions. She shook her head and said that I would need to call because 6 months after the biopsy, I would need to be checked for HPV again. And every 1-3 months after until I could ""test clean"". I walked out crying even harder now. My fiance all but carried me to the car. He tried to drive carefully but every tiny bump on the under-construction road caused me to howl in pain. He was visibly upset. He had to carry me up the stairs and to the bed where I spent two days in the worst pain of my life.

Now it is November (6 months after the procedure). The biopsy came back normal. Everything was fine. I asked again about the HPV issue. I was told no further information could be given and then hung up on. I have not scheduled my follow-up pap. I don't even want to walk into that office again. The iodine solution caused a nasty yeast infection which the doctor insisted was not possible and refused to give me medicine for. I have been struggling with it every since because it does not go away with anything over the counter. She is still convinced I am being over-dramatic.

I called again, telling her I was having severe problems with the biopsy site. It seems to have never healed. Sex is a bloody, painful mess. It is impossible. I end up howling in pain again and bleeding for an hour or so after. We can't have sex at all. We've stopped completely and have no hopes of ever being intimate again. When I explained this to the nurse on the phone, she sighed and said ""you just need more lube"". No, that's not the problem at all! I told her that I felt the biopsy site had not healed properly. She said it was impossible and joked that not being able to have sex was my solution to permanent birth control. I hung up without bothering to tell her why the joke was in poor taste.

I'm not sure if this doctor is just a quack. Perhaps it was all a scare tactic to make me get the HPV vaccine. I mean, the word ""cancer"" was thrown around a lot, considering there seemed to be absolutely nothing wrong with me. Perhaps this was some sort of sick revenge because I personally offended her by saying I wanted to be childfree. I'll never know. And I'll never have the money to sue.

I will be searching for a new OB/GYN that can help me with the mass amounts of scar tissue I have from the biopsy and is also cool with me being childfree. I am getting fixed and I'm never letting another doctor push me around and bully me into making choices that would ultimately ruin my life.

For the record, she told me about 10 times that having HPV dormant in my body would not prevent me from having healthy children. I probably have some sort of note in my file stating that I need to be convinced to breed.

Sorry, that was a long one. Thanks for hanging in there guys.",10/11/2015 19:57
"Musings on HPV: Exposure, Risk, and Ethics",1,7asdp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/7asdp1/musings_on_hpv_exposure_risk_and_ethics/,3,1509849129,"I am male and well over the max recommended age (26) or number of partners (4) for an HPV vaccine. In fact I'm almost 50 and have had I guess around 20 unprotected sex partners in my lifetime. Protected partners, well, lots more. So even though I have no symptoms I am almost definitely a walking HPV carrier, right? Not that us older people aren't probably all carriers. (BTW yes I do STD screenings and am ""clean"").
  
Currently I'm in casual relationships with two women. One came back with an abnormal pap. She is getting it biopsied and of course now HPV is all I can think about. We have been having sex for months now and use condoms but that doesn't necessarily help with HPV, and we've had unprotected oral as well. Maybe she got it from me and maybe I got it from her and maybe I don't carry it. There is no way to know. Given my past ""adventures"" does this active infection put me and current or future partners at a higher risk than there was before?  
  
I can't test for it and I don't have any symptoms. What if anything do I tell the other partner or future partners? I could say I have been exposed to HPV, but that risk is true for nearly everyone in my demographic, given the statistics.  
  
As men are we expected to tell all partners that we have been exposed to high risk HPV in our lifetimes, and may or may not be carrying it, when by some statistics most of us have carried and may still carry it? Does it do anyone any good? Isn't it like warning a date that there's a risk she'll be in a car accident and die on the way to the date? If so does that obligation ever expire when we could still be carrying it around? I am trying to come to grips with the idea that the reality is, those of us of a certain age should just accept the fact we've all been exposed and that women should get regular paps and that's the end of it. I don't know. I just know this whole thing has me stressed and depressed about how sex puts us all at risk. 
  
Not sure what kind of response I'm looking for; just needed to vent and put this out there. This seemed like the proper place. ",5/11/2017 10:32

Age limits for vaccines? (/r/AskScience x-post),3,79t1c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virology/comments/79t1c2/age_limits_for_vaccines_raskscience_xpost/,2,1509448064,"I was recently looking over the [CDC recommended immunization schedule for adults](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-combined-schedule.pdf) and I noticed a couple of oddities. Most notably is the HPV vaccine. Why isn't this recommended for males past age 21 and for females past age 26? Is there a biological reason that people become less susceptible as they age? On a related note, why is 1957 the cutoff birth year for MMR vaccine?",31/10/2017 19:07
Son had shots that he didn't get.,4,67glb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/67glb1/son_had_shots_that_he_didnt_get/,13,1493156351,"In 2015, my son was 11 years old and it was time for the new HPV vaccine. The vaccine is optional and since it was only 5-6 years old I opted out of getting it. I figured we would readdress it when he started getting interested in girls. Well, flash forward to 2017 and now girls are coming into my house and they have boobs and he is interested and I decide that when he goes for his 13 year check up it is time for him to start the shots (it is a set of 3 shots, 1 then 3 months later another one, then 6 months later another). My husband has to take him for the check up because I am working, and low and behold the doctor said he had those shots. I ask my husband to get a copy of my sons shot record and bring it home, and bam there the shots are. So I was like, ""Surely there is an error, I bet he wasn't even at the doctors office on the days these shots were supposedly given"", so I go to the doctors office/hospital information app on my phone and low and behold he was at the doctor all of those days and it shows on the app that the shots were given. Now, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did not get those shots on those days because I was weary of the vaccine being so new and being even newer to males. This was the strangest thing that has happened to me recently and after spending long hours reading this sub I thought it was the perfect place to post it.

TLDR: My son recieved a set of 3 shots that I know he didn't get but there are records to prove it happened.",26/4/2017 5:39

>higher median household income and higher percentage of White race in the population, but not educational attainment, significantly predicted higher percentages of students with personal belief exemptions in 2013.

They did statistical analysis to separate the effect of being white from the effect of having more money, and still found that being white was associated with getting a personal belief exemption from having one's child vaccinated.  

Another study, [Personal Belief Exemptions to Vaccination in California: A Spatial Analysis](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2015/05/26/peds.2015-0831) had similar results.  

A national poll on people's attitudes about vaccines [had different results](https://qz.com/355398/the-average-anti-vaxxer-is-probably-not-who-you-think-she-is/):  anti-vaxxers were more likely to be male, less likely to be affluent, more likely to be rural, less likely to be college-educated, and more likely to be politically liberal.  This poll didn't ask for people's race.  Both parents and non-parents were included.  

Another study, [Communicating Effectively About Vaccines:  Summary of a Survey of U.S. Parents and Guardians](http://www.astho.org/Programs/Immunization/Communicating-Effectively-About-Vaccines--Summary-of-a-Survey-of-U-S--Parents-and-Guardians/) found

>Overall, we found few significant demographic differences across the categories. 
The SIGNIFICANT REFUSERS tend to be better educated, and have slightly higher household incomes than other groups.

>MINOR REFUSERS tend to have older, rather than younger children, which we suggest may be related to refusal of HPV vaccine, though we did not ask this question. VACCINATORS WITH MAJOR CONCERNS include a higher percentage of African-Americans, a lower percentage of Whites, and are less likely to be employed. Conversely, VACCINATORS WITH MINOR CONCERNS include a lower percentage of African Americans and Hispanics, and a higher percentage of Whites.

So far, is the narrative that vaccine refusal is about economic privilege / being white, correct?  So far, it seems like it is in California but maybe not across the entire USA.",9/5/2017 8:36

7. Educate yourself about sexual consent and make sure there is clear, unambiguous communication of consent in all your sexual relationships.

8. Be responsible for contraception.

9. Get the HPV vaccine.

10. Have progressive name politics.

11. If you have children, be an equal parent.

14. Make sure that honesty and respect guide your romantic and sexual relationships with women.

15. DonŠ—Èt be an online bystander in the face of sexism.

16. Be responsible with money in domestic/romantic relationships.

20. Ensure that some of your heroes and role models are women.

21. Praise the virtues and accomplishments of women in your life to others.

22. Have integrity with your male friends. (i.e., DonŠ—Èt be a Š—“bro.Š—)

23. DonŠ—Èt treat your spouse like a Š—“nag.Š— If she is Š—“nagging,Š— you are probably lagging. 

24. Know that acknowledging your own sexist opinions and stereotypes you hold is not enough. Do something about them.

25. Befriend women.

27. When in a romantic relationship, be responsible for events and special dates associated with your side of the family.

33. Walk the walk about income inequality.

34. Get in the habit of treating your maleness as an unearned privilege that you have to actively work to cede rather than femaleness being an unearned disadvantage that women have to work to overcome.

35. Self-identify as a feminist.",2/9/2016 11:19
HPV Vaccine,1,6u0avs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/6u0avs/hpv_vaccine/,6,1502894765,"Age: Teens
Sex: Male
Height: 5 feet 6 inches
Weight: 103

So I went to get my annual checkup today. And the doctor suggested that I should get the Hepatitis A and HPV vaccines. In addition to that I was also suggested to get a skin related test that's done yearly (I don't remember what it's called). In addition to that the doctor also gave me a sheet giving some information regarding Hepatitis A vaccine and the HPV vaccine.

Background: FYI, I am still going to a pediatrician as I am not old enough for the doctor my parents go to. I have been with my pediatrician since I was a kid (or born?). Nowadays my pediatrician has hired new graduates to work for his many office locations (barely see him now). I don't think I've seen any same new doctors for more than 1-2 years. 

I was offered the Hepatitis A vaccine over the course of many years, but refused it as it was not as much of a problem back in the day. But since Hep. A is becoming a bigger problem now, the decision was made to receive the vaccine. Given HPV's cancer related effects, the vaccine was also decided to be given.

During checkup normal procedure of checking vision, hearing, body etc etc went as normal. Blood pressure was 105/65 or something around that via digital machine.

Anyways, after all that, I received the first of three planned vaccines. First vaccine was Hep. A. It was administered with no problems. I did not feel anything off after that first one.


Please note that I NEVER had any such side affects with any vaccines throughout my life so far. Nor do any family members that I know of. So I was not expecting what happened below.

Then came the second, HPV. Immediately after my doctor administered the dose, my vision started blacking out. No worries, must be one of those quick 0.1 fade in fade outs that happen sometimes. But the blackout continued to grow. In addition to that, my ear drums began ringing increasingly louder. Of course I thought nothing of it and that it'd go away soon. But as it increased, I found it very peculiar. At that point, I stopped my doctor who was already preparing that skin test shot. I quickly described what I was experiencing as she got the assistant to go get some water.

Between the time the assistant left and came back, I got to the climax of my side effects. My vision had every color almost completely black and my ear drums were almost as loud as what I was hearing from my doctor and mom who was with me in the room at the time. In addition to that, my whole body began to feel hot and began sweating as the climax was reached. Upon pleading the climax, I also felt lightheaded. At the same time the doctor also moved me to another room which had a bigger bed for me lie on.

The assistant then came back with the water and after I drank it, the climax began to climb back down along with my other symptoms. I was told to continue drinking water and to lie down to let the side effects settle down. The lightheaded went away first. Then followed with the blackout slowly receding. And somewhere during the middle of the blackout receding, my hearing ear drum ringing also began to recede. By the time my vision was back to normal, I was still having some hearing problems. The doctor monitored me until my symptoms were back to normal.

I was the told to continue lying down and drinking water to recover for the next 20-30 or so minutes. Somewhere in between, the doctor came to check my blood pressure via old fashioned way with the pump and gauge. I was told my blood pressure dropped to 95/55 or so. I was advised to drink more water and rest till then. After everything was fine, I was sent home.

These side effects scared both my mom and the doctor as she graduated just a year ago and it was her first time witnessing such side effects from this vaccine. As for my mom, it was also a first as no family members have had vaccine side effects before.

Now my question is, should continue this vaccination? 

I still have two more doses to go but after experiencing such side effects, I don't know whether or not the next dose(s) could lead to something more serious.

Note I am not anti vaccine nor are any of my family members. But this has scared the living crap out of my mom and I hope to never revisit this unpleasant experience again...

I know this is very long, but it's because I thought that details would matter. Thanks for reading. All comments/questions are appreciated.",16/8/2017 22:46
Opinions on an HPV vaccination?,9,5rrwpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/5rrwpk/opinions_on_an_hpv_vaccination/,18,1486125241,"Hi /r/AskDocs! I'm looking for some advice in terms of whether or not I should receive a particular vaccine; particularly, the HPV vaccine. Some background:

I'm 16 years old and male, and live in the U.S.. I currently have a girlfriend, but we ***are not*** currently sexually active, in terms of full-contact sex, this has not happened and we do not intend it to for some time. I have to note that we may choose to begin sexual activities (as in full-contact sex) eventually, but likely not for a few months from now at the very least. I'd also like to state that, while appreciated, I truthfully do not need ""the talk."" I've already had it from both my parents and physician; I don't mean to be arrogant, but both me and my girlfriend are smart students and highly value our futures. When we do begin this, we will be sure to engage in full safety.

Anyways, recently my doctor has been highly suggesting the HPV vaccination. At first I was entirely in agreement, I didn't see any reason *not* to. However, after talking with my mother who, apparently, had done some research has found a plethora of issues on the topic; many concerned recipients of the virus have experienced undesirable side effects, and she's delved into government-backed lawsuits against the vaccination, some with side effects such as *infertility.*

I've spoken with her gynecologist (as I've requested a meeting with her for this exact issue, long story), and she often suggests to some of her young female patients to avoid it for some of these exact reasons. She said she'll email me with some more evidence or ideas on the subject if I'd like.

Now I've yet to to a ton of research on my own and have only seen some of the things she's directly showed me. I figured I may as well ask here, to see what you guys have to say.

Any insight is appreciated, and any sourcing and documentation is as well. Many thanks!",3/2/2017 20:34
Questinioning my gender. Pretty confused right now. (possible TW?),2,71g4en,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/71g4en/questinioning_my_gender_pretty_confused_right_now/,2,1505988964,"Yo, I'm super confused here. I don't know anything anymore. 
(This is way longer than I wanted it to be. Kinda feel silly for having written this much about my shitty feeling Š—– IŠ—…m nervous tbh because this feels so personal)

Also, TW for a bit of self-harm/-mutilation talk.

I canŠ—…t recall too much of my childhood but there are at least a few memories which always stuck with me.
Back in kindergarten I never really felt like a girl. I donŠ—…t remember feeling like a guy either but the more I think about it the more I start to believe that this was for a different reason Š—– I could look at the boys around me and recognize that they were different from me in appearence which obviously meant that I couldnŠ—…t be one of them. 
When we were role-playing I also preferred to be a male character. At one point I started thinking this was weird and embarassing so I started to repress it (this was way later on, when I was in elementary).
Also remember stuffing my pants when I was alone and I never knew what to think of that. DonŠ—…t know much about elementary, only that I felt completely alienated from the girls like they were speaking a different language. I still had female friends and that was ok but for the most part I felt quite wrong. 

My childhood wasn't all that great but also not all that bad. My family is a bit of a mess Š—– my grandparents are very controlling, my mom is a bit overbearing and my father never gave a shit about me and only hit me/told me he was going to kill me/told me to fuck off. IŠ—…m not really angry at any of this Š—– there are reasons why they are like this and whatŠ—…s done is done. 
However I had some anger issues as a kid and got sent to a therapist for this. DonŠ—…t remember much about that either but a few years later she told me that I never really talked to her about anything. 

Then puberty came and my life went to hell.
I hated myself. I hated my body. I was disgusted with it. I still am. I've met quite a few mentally ill people because I've been
to hospitals due to self-harm, skipping school and a suicide attempt but I can't remember anyone having such problems with their body like
I do. Kinda arrogant to assume this but most of them didnŠ—…t have problems with watching videos of themselves or  were in romantic relationships, both which do not work for me. I canŠ—…t look at pictures of myself or in the mirror Š—– the person I see is wrong. I have a hard time believing this is my body because I have no real connection to it. ItŠ—…s like IŠ—…m trapped in it. When IŠ—…m not Š—_awareŠ—… of it IŠ—…m more like a floating consciousness but once I take a look at myself IŠ—…m back in reality.
The thought of someone touching me Š—_down thereŠ—… or Š—_up thereŠ—… repulses me to no end. It makes me sick. My breasts feel like they were clued on by someone else, I LOATHE my period to no end, my vagina is weird and I hate my curves. 
For the most part I started to ignore it (never took track of my period, stopped taking care of myself when puberty came around, never went to a gynecologicst, never gave a shit about that HPV vaccine although I did get it, etc.) and get miserable whenever I was reminded that I was Š—_trappedŠ—… in here (e.g., by looking in the mirror). But I sometimes had and have the urge to cut my own breasts off, to stab my vagina or I always hoped that I would get cancer so people would remove my uterus. Also had two phases where I starved myself because I couldnŠ—…t stand my curves. 
I thought this was just some self-harming shit like how one of the reasons why IŠ—…m cutting is because I actually want to fuck my body up.
But itŠ—…s not like I have any reason to hate my body like this because honestly, nobody ever told me that IŠ—…m ugly or anything. If they did I canŠ—…t remember.

Kinda had the idea of binding my breasts and starting to wear boy clothes when I was 16 but dropped it because I was too shy to try it. Also tried a few times to be more girly, to dress myself more feminine, to put on some make-up but it never really felt right at all, just like a mask I was wearing. I avoid wearing 'feminine' clothing and whenever I do I'm really uncomfortable.

I also have some serious confusion when it comes to my sexual orientation. IŠ—…m kinda positive that IŠ—…m attracted to guys but the thought of being with a guy and being the Š—_womanŠ—… just seems so wrong. I have some attraction to ladies too and I can accept that a little bit better but not to the point where I would let a girl touch me. Kinda messes me up because everything I consider (Straight? Bi? Gay?) just seems wrong. It doesnŠ—…t fit.

And yeah. Sometimes I get this sensation of having a flat chest or a penis (like weird phantom limb syndrome) but whenever I try to check my breasts are in the way or thereŠ—…s nothing there which always distresses me a little. Nothing that makes me heavily depressed though Š—– itŠ—…s more like being annoyed that I was born with this shit. 

I just ignored a lot of things. I went through life like I was a robot, somewhat detached from myself and the world around me. Nothing ever seemed right and I just wanted to die tbh.
I was aware of trans people ever since I was 14 and I never had a problem with it. It was just how it  is. I never really knew what HRT can do and I never thought of it all that much. Kinda avoided it too, it wasnŠ—…t just something I wanted to deal with. 
But then a friend of a friend came out and I met a few transman online and it kinda messed me up a bit. I thought I was transphobic at first but itŠ—…s also a bit like I was jealous, like they could be who they were and I was just stuck in this shitty body. 
And then I found out what HRT can actually do and that you can top surgery (how naive is this? Why did never really think about this before? WTF) and ever since then things have been getting worse. At first I thought it was some
kink stuff but then I couldn't stop thinking of going through that myself and that this was actually something that sounded incredibly appealing to me. 

Not sure what to think of all that. Am I in phase? Am I having some weird crisis? Is this related to my mental illness?
Because I'm not sure what to think of social transition. Taking on a male name and male pronouns sounds weird and unusual but not exactly awful (I mean, I get a rush whenever someone thought I was a dude online but one time this happened irl and it kinda upset me because I thought being masculine as a girl means that you failed and are unattractive, wtf). Don't really if
I do want to be seen as a man by others - I mean, I guess. Maybe. IŠ—…m kinda scared I canŠ—…t fully blend in with the other guys or that I might come across as creepy and weird (IŠ—…m quite shy and awkward and crippled by my anxiety and I guess people are more accepting of that if you are a girl). 

Oh yeah, and of course there is mental illness. I've been diagnosed with recurrent/chronic depression and avpd. There is a chance that I might have bpd - one of my therapists
thought about it and dismissed it because I wasn't showing enough symptoms or I was too young and another suggested it but I only had her for five sessions.
It kinda made sense to me though with all the self-harm, the self-hatred, my confusion over my sexuality, etc. but now IŠ—…m not so sure anymore. 

And there's my family of course. I doubt my sister would care and my parents are pretty tolerant but everyone else would probably lose their shit. Not that that would influence me in anything but it would be very hurtful.

IŠ—…m so scared I might just be some shitty girl who has a identity crisis. The thought of this makes me want to scream because part of me makes me feel like something would be taken away from me. For the first time in my life I have something that might explain all those extremely negative feelings I have about my body, why I never related to the person in the mirror, why I was so scared of physical intimancy, something that makes *sense*. I always dreaded the idea of growing old as a woman to the point where I planned on killing myself before I was 30. I never really saw a future for myself but now I can at least imagine one. But what if IŠ—…m making this all up, desperate to find something that might ease my self-hatred?

I canŠ—…t stop thinking about this. I'm way more aware of my body now and it's driving me mad. I really want to talk to my old therapist about this but IŠ—…m so afraid she might laugh at me and think IŠ—…m fucking crazy because IŠ—…m making shit up.  ",21/9/2017 18:16
Is there a blood test for HPV?,4,61ywm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/61ywm0/is_there_a_blood_test_for_hpv/,10,1490731282,"Hi! Please forgive my ignorance as I am at the very beginning of trying to understand HPV. I know that will be frustrating for long-term sufferers, so I apologise for that.

I am just wondering if there is anything i can do to protect myself against HPV. My partner and I have had extensive blood-testing, including some tests that we had to pay privately for because they are not given routinely as part of a standard STI panel. 

I've been quite affected by understanding more about herpes. There is very little information available from my health service about herpes and they did not make it clear that there was a blood test which you could go and pay for privately if you really wanted it.

So my health service is saying that there is no blood test for HPV but I'm just wondering if this is, in fact, accurate?

Is there a blood test for HPV?

Is there anything I can do to have me and my (male) partner tested for it?

I had a cervical smear a couple of months ago, and I also have the Cervarix vaccine. This is an old-style vaccine and not as good as Gardasil. It protects against 70% of cancer-causing strains of HPV, whereas Gardasil protects against those, and also 90% of HPV strains in general. (I am looking into getting Gardasil on top of my Cervarix, but this will take at least 6 months...)",29/3/2017 4:01

Diagnosed with HPV. Wondering how I ought to approach next steps.,5,5k4lgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/5k4lgb/diagnosed_with_hpv_wondering_how_i_ought_to/,25,1482636203,"Hi all.  I'm a 27-year-old gay (obviously I guess) male.  I moved to a small college town for a temporary fellowship-type thing 18 months ago, and then from there to a new big gay city six months ago.  Before this I never had a slut phase,  but I guess more free time, being far away from friends and in new places, and working out more has, while not remedying continued romantic failure, at least got me laid a lot. 

The party ended in November, when I went through several STI scares at once -- a ""hey got X bad thing get tested"" text plus then noticing two dots on my dick -- both quite small, one only a millimeter across or so.  

My usual STI panels came back negative thankfully.  A first dermatologist then diagnosed the skin dots as molluscum contagiosum, a fairly benign thing in the scheme of things.  She seemed quite incompetent though (quote: ""so, have they cured HIV yet?"" lol).  A primary care doctor later didn't disagree with this diagnosis. 

I took a needle, benzoil peroxide, and coconut oil to the two dots, and the first one went away two days after being poked (which does seem typical of molluscum contagiosum).  Hooray! But the second tiny one persisted, so I went to see a (different) dermatologist. 

This dermatologist said he thought the little dot looked like HPV, not molluscum contagiosum.  It was too small to biopsy, but he said he was 90% sure it was a tiny genital wart.  He hit me with some liquid nitrogen, and hopefully after the small welt presently on my dick falls off, the wart thing is over (I am of course noticing every tiny non-Fordyce-looking spot on my skin imaginable now though; so I'll probably go back for followup to make sure we're good in January). 

I was pretty surprised over all this, as I've actually had all three gardasil shots.  The last two were even with the new heptavalent version of the vaccine -- I thought I was pretty bulletproof against at least this STI.   

Questions: how long should I stay celibate?  My fairly nonchalant dermatologist said ""oh maybe wait 3-4 weeks.""  Most recurrences happen within 3 months though, and asymptomatic infection can last for six months to two years (and after that scientists aren't sure if the virus just lays dormant rather than being gone forever).  

At the moment I'm considering trying to stay off all apps for three months, and then after that trying to really focus on dates/romance and not fucking around.  What would you do?  Also, if chemistry is in the air and you're told that the other guy had a wart just a few months ago, how would you react?  If you were me, would you disclose before first dates, after them, or only just before getting naked? 

Thanks for all advice and/or for just letting me vent about this.  ",25/12/2016 11:23

Hello. I know alot of you are frustrated at me and I am seeing doctor(psychologist) to help with my anxiety. Moreover, I have one last question and wanted some feedback. I have taken HIV 4th generation tests up to 6 months after the day of exposure and the results came back negative. But I also used PEP, got Hep B boosters, HPV vaccines, and a flu shot at the same time. I was wondering if any of these could make my HIV test result false. I am especially concerned about all of these making a synergistic effect and can cause HIV tests to be inaccurate or delay HIV seroconversion. Not many people get PEP, Hep B boosters, HPV vaccines, and a flu shot at the same time. In fact, I think I might be the only one who did. So obviously there is not going to be evidence that shows that all these factors can cause an inaccurate HIV test or delay seroconversion. Am I thinking about this the right way?

HPV cancers in Males were finally recognised by major TV networks in Canada.,23,58hj8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/58hj8t/hpv_cancers_in_males_were_finally_recognised_by/,12,1477006965,"Normally we only hear about women's health issues on TV news such as breast cancer 
so last evening I was quite surprised that the major TV networks in Canada
raised awareness that mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV is on the rise among 
Canadian men and were pointing how vaccination was available to girls in all provinces but not in all provinces for boys.


But they didn't say anything if the vaccine works on adult men or encouraged adult men to get vaccinated. 



I don't know why they finally recognized this problem in men as this is very unusual in Canada.


Probably to save the women?

""Between 1992 and 2012, the incidence of HPV-related mouth and throat cancers increased 56 per cent in males and 17 per cent in females.""

.


""But itŠ—Ès now more common to see HPV-related throat and mouth cancers in younger, otherwise healthy patients.""

""Recent studies suggest that oropharyngeal cancer will become the most common HPV-associated malignancy by the year 2020, surpassing cancer of the cervix,Š—

Having sex with someone with HPV,1,6zxxeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/6zxxeh/having_sex_with_someone_with_hpv/,1,1505368926,"I (male), have recently started to see a woman. We have not had intercourse yet, and she recently told me she has HPV. 

I went to my doctor to see if its safe to have intercourse with her with a condom, and he said because I have the vaccine, he'd rate it a 1 to 3 out of 10 on a ""riskyness"" scale. 

He said ultimately its my decision if I like her enough to take that risk, even though it is low. 

Has anyone had similar experiences and can share their thoughts?

Thank you",14/9/2017 14:02

[STD HPV] HPV vaccine for men? I'm 24M need some help,2,5nad0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/5nad0j/std_hpv_hpv_vaccine_for_men_im_24m_need_some_help/,11,1484141347,"Hello, I recently decided to try an open relationship with my gf and I've started to worry about STD and the like, the one that I fear the most at the moment is HPV because it seems that everyone get it and most people don't even know. Some questions:
 * I'm a man and I'd like to get the vaccine, is this doable? Is there anything different or dangerous about the male version?
I live in Italy if that's important, 

 * also how do I know if I already have some strain of hpv? I've done stupid things in the past [yeah fuck me] but never had problems, my gf luckily did the vaccine when young. If i have some strain what will the vaccine do?

 * when does the vaccine become effective? I know the full course take almost a year, I'm all in for safety but it would be a bit of a let down having to wait for a year before trying to get sexual with someone else. I would ofc use caution there are other std but I don't know if I should reconsider my open relationship, maybe open it up later on when I have the full course of the vaccine [before you ask, i know it sounds selfish but I don't think I would be able to let my GF have fun around while I can't for an entire year ]

Thanks everyone for your time and help, if you have some tips for anything other than HPV feel free to add! I'll appreciate


P.s. why The fuck don't they teach this in school It blows my mind",11/1/2017 21:29
Gf tested positive for HPV - questions,0,6ivwyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/6ivwyi/gf_tested_positive_for_hpv_questions/,3,1498189190,"So my gf failed to previously mentioned that she has HPV. She thought it was the same as HSV1.    

First off, she has no idea if she got the vaccine but is trying to track down that info. Is it possible that she mau have tested positive because she got the vaccine? She's 29 now.    

Since we've had unprotected sex I'm assuming I have it as well. Is it worth getting tested? If the test comes back negative should I look into getting the vaccine? I'm 30, male. I know it tends to affect women more strongly than men and I've also heard that there are age windows for the vaccine. Can anyone confirm or deny this?    

To be clear, I'm waiting for an appt with my PCP to discuss but this will just help give me some background so I know what the hell I'm talking about with him.    

Third, I have a nasty hemorrhoid. Could this be related? I heard HPV can cause ass cancer and I'm a heavy smoker on top of it.      

Thanks in advance.

"Looking for critique on my ""regime""",1,5tvykg,https://www.reddit.com/r/genitalwarts/comments/5tvykg/looking_for_critique_on_my_regime/,7,1487052611,"Crossposting this to a few other subreddits as well.

About a month ago I was diagnosed with GW. I'm a 25 year old male. Healthy in all other aspects (diet, stress, exercise, etc). I tried the ACV method for about 3 weeks with no luck. Mostly it just mangled up my penis and now I'm focusing more on healing it then the warts. My warts are all contained on my shaft, UNDER my foreskin (a very difficult area to isolate with any sort of treatment).

My plan is the following:

- get the gardasil9 vaccine (just had my first shot). I know this isn't a ""cure"" or anything like that, but I've read it can help with future outbreaks, as well as other strains of HPV and will help avoid the cancer causing ones.
- I've ordered Tyginta. Once it arrives I'm going to start using it twice daily on the affected areas
- Take AHCC supplements. I've ordered 120 capsules of the 750mg AHCC. I've read lots about the immune boosting effects of AHCC and have high hopes.
- Continue to live a healthy lifestyle with rest, good diet, and exercise. 

Does this sound like it could work? My doctor hasn't been a ton of help (besides helping me obtain the gardasil9 vaccine). I'm not looking for a quick fix, I'm looking to fight it at the root.

Thanks.",14/2/2017 14:10

"[Health insurance, USA] Healthcare provider stated that vaccine would be covered under insurance, a month ago. I received bill from insurance stating vaccine wasn't covered because there was no referral for vaccine. How do I dispute payment and/or negotiate full cost down?",1,5nfma3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/5nfma3/health_insurance_usa_healthcare_provider_stated/,10,1484205439,"**Backstory**  
In December 2016, I went to a local CVS Minuteclinic to get a school mandatory health workup done, such as TB skin test. I have used Minuteclinic in the past for mandatory vaccines such as MMR booster shots through UnitedHealthcare's Student health insurance in the past with no issues with billing. Toward the end of my visit, the healthcare provider asks me if I was interested in and wanted a vaccine for HPV. I made no mention of HPV vaccine during the entire visit. She told me that there were new research and guidelines out showing benefit in getting HPV vaccines for males, when normally they are for females. I asked if it would be covered via insurance and she said it should be since it is a vaccine / preventative medicine. Later she as she was finishing typing up the patient report, she reconfirmed to me that the HPV vaccine shouldn't cost anything out of pocket. I currently still have the Patient Visit Receipt that shows $0.00 next to the charge for HPV.  

**This week**  
I received mail from CVS Minuteclinic billing me for $235. $214 for the HPV vaccine and $21 for Vaccine Injection. In the letter, it states **""UHC Student Resources notified us that you did not have the required referral. This balance is your responsibility. If this is incorrect, contact your insurer""**   

* I did not need a referral in the past to get any vaccinations, thus I didn't expect to have this problem. In hindsight, I shouldn't have assumed that.  
* The healthcare provider at the clinic repeatedly told me that my insurance would cover it. While the final burden is on me, is there any way I can use what she said to nullify/lower the bill?  
* What are the best steps to lower the bill? Who do I contact first (insurance or minuteclinic billing) and what's the proper way to address this issue?**  

Thanks for helping in advance. I've never had this issue in the past before so I'm quite lost on how to negotiate medical bills.",12/1/2017 15:17

I eat extremely healthy and do not drink since my diagnosis and I have never smoked. I was okay at first, since it was just one wart, and it still is only one wart, but just a few days ago I began to notice a little bump here and there in my mouth. They don't look normal, and so I did some internet searching and think it may be oral HPV. I've done oral sex with around 6 partners, all before I got the gardisil vaccine.

A poly guy in his mid-30s inquires about Gardasil,106,2j6mgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/2j6mgu/a_poly_guy_in_his_mid30s_inquires_about_gardasil/,44,1413286414,"So the backstory here: I'm 36, cis/het/male, solo poly with (currently) three partners.  I've been communicating with a woman for a couple of months now who revealed to me that she was HPV-positive and had had cervical cancer -- twice.

While there was/is no indication that the communication we've been having will progress any farther than a friendship, it got me thinking: what if I was to be intimate with this woman, or another woman with HPV?  I could be putting my paramours (and potentially, metamours) at risk (condoms are not 100% effective against HPV infection/transmission, like all other STDs, but it's better than nothing).

So I looked into Gardasil.  I found that it was recommended for men and women under the age of 26.  But it's only been available since about 2006.  Do the math; I was older than the recommended age before it was even available.

My question became ""is it available for me, a 36 year old male.""  Online resources were mum on the subject, and a few even said that it's not available for guys my age.

This required further researching.

So at social time after a local poly discussion meeting, I asked about men getting Gardasil....no one had sufficient answers.  In fact, none of the men at that group had ever received the vaccine either.

So I finally I went to the best source I could get: Planned Parenthood.  The one in Arvada, Colorado, deliciously situated in the same shopping center as a Hobby Lobby, would be my final destination for the information I need.

Here's what I found there--your mileage may vary in other locations:

The answer was that they will give it to men, but insurance doesn't cover it for men older than 26. It's three shots over six months. For those with low income there's a program for free or discounted vaccinations; otherwise, the whole treatment was quoted as $595 in three different payments.

The vaccine protects against four of the over 100 known strains of HPV: types 16 and 18 which cause 70% of all cases of cervical cancer, and types 6 and 11 which cause 90% of all cases of genital warts.

As part of the initial consultation, I was asked why I was interested in getting it.  I told the nursing assistant that I was polyamorous and had three partners and I was concerned that I was in a population of (potentially) higher risk to contract and retransmit HPV to my partners, who I would like to protect.

The nursing assistant expressed excitement when men get the shots, because while men aren't at as big a risk of illness with HPV, they're doing it to protect the women in their lives (she used the words ""I get excited"").

The shot itself is a little painful, like a numbness in the upper arm (much more than I experienced with flu or tetanus shots). They had me wait for fifteen minutes after the shot to ensure I didn't pass out or have a reaction, which would have been unexpected but worth waiting to see.

One down, two to go.

On another note, the staff was very courteous and professional. Their intake paperwork also included fields for gender identity and preferred pronouns, which I'd never seen before in a medical office.

No vaccine is 100% effective, but neither are any bulletproof vests.  If you're going to get shot, the next best thing to avoiding standing in the line of fire altogether is wearing as much body armor as you can acquire.

**Final Note**:  If you're the kind of idiot who believes that vaccines cause autism, off is the direction in which you can fuck.  If you think vaccines are unnatural, you shouldn't be reading anything on a computer or internet-connected phone.  If you think vaccines are ineffective, think about all the young friends you have who don't have smallpox.

And if you haven't been vaccinated for the other vaccine-preventable STD (Hepatitis B) you shouldn't be having barrier-free sex of any kind with anyone.

About a month ago I was diagnosed with GW. I'm a 25 year old male. Healthy in all other aspects (diet, stress, exercise, etc). I tried the ACV method for about 3 weeks with no luck. Mostly it just mangled up my penis and now I'm focusing more on healing it then the warts. My warts are all contained on my shaft, UNDER my foreskin (a very difficult area to isolate with any sort of treatment).

My plan is the following:

get the gardasil9 vaccine (just had my first shot). I know this isn't a ""cure"" or anything like that, but I've read it can help with future outbreaks, as well as other strains of HPV and will help avoid the cancer causing ones.
    
I've ordered Tyginta. Once it arrives I'm going to start using it twice daily on the affected areas
    
Take AHCC supplements. I've ordered 120 capsules of the 750mg AHCC. I've read lots about the immune boosting effects of AHCC and have high hopes.
    
Continue to live a healthy lifestyle with rest, good diet, and exercise.

Does this sound like it could work? My doctor hasn't been a ton of help (besides helping me obtain the gardasil9 vaccine). I'm not looking for a quick fix, I'm looking to fight it at the root.

If it turns out I have HPV, I will obviously talk about it with future partners before having sex. But what's my responsibility to past partners? 

Background:

1. I've been sexually active for around 12 years, with mostly men and a few women.

2. I ALWAYS use condoms with male partners. I sometimes, but rarely, use gloves/dental dams with female ones.

3. I've never had warts or other visible symptoms of HPV. I don't think I've ever been tested for HPV before, though I get tested regularly for other STIs. So, if I have it now, I have NO IDEA how long ago I was exposed.

4. I got the HPV vaccine several years ago.

5. Last pap, around three years ago, was normal.

6. My understanding is that men can't get tested, so telling them would just be an FYI. It wouldn't prompt them to get tested and wouldn't give them useful information for the future. It would just be an uncomfortable conversation with no upside.

I'm leaning toward not contacting past male partners because of point #6 above. But I would appreciate some outside perspective. Am I off-base? If so, how would you suggest I proceed?",3/10/2016 12:04

I said ""fuck it, let's do it"" because I trust him and I guess better safe than sorry. Now though, since I am not sexually active and potentially asexual, I'm questioning my decision and the necessity of the vaccine.

I'm a mid twenties male, shes a mid-twenties female. Some history of the relationship might be elucidating:

We started off as friends but both wanted to get physical. I rebuffed her repeatedly as I'd just left another relationship and came away with a case of HPV. I had no intentions of infecting her, and knew I wouldnt be able to live with the guilt if i did. After much dread, I admitted this to her as the reason we couldn't be more than friends. She was touched by my honesty, got the vaccine, and only after that did we start hooking up and dating. Then we moved in together. Fast forward to now.

We've been dating basically 3+ years at this point. She ended up contracting HPV despite the vaccine. We haven't had sex in over a year and a half. She's totally cold to the idea of sex, and, understandably, the entire experience is framed negatively by HPV. Despite receiving the full vaccine before we became physical, she's developed pre-cancerous cells in her uterus and is (rightfully so) pretty traumatized about it.

We still love each other very much. I get the occasion oral sex from her (less frequently now), though she recoils from my touch or any attempts I make to repay the favor. 

I have tried all the things: massages, full-day pampering, making her dinner, cleaning the apartment, love letters, love notes, love poems, surprise gifts, vacations together, and still the sex is nowhere on the horizon. I'm pretty torn about all this. On the one hand I feel sorry for her and guilty about much of this, but on the other hand, I gave her full disclosure before we every touched each other. I love her and I feel guilty about all that, but I just want to have a loving, sexual relationship with her. It has been over a year and half since we had sex.

I realized today that the best way to sum up sexism against men in todays culture might in fact be a question.

I decided to take to the streets (and yahoo answers) to test my hypothesis, and needless to say i confirmed what i suspected.

""If 3 men and 1 woman were drowning and you had to choose, would you save the 3 men or 1 woman?""

and yea, you know what the more frequently given answer was.

try it yourself. then knock the 3 men up to 4, then 5, then 10, than 100. see how many it takes.

our culture automatically favors women. subconsciously, people treat women better, even if they are unaware of it.

If its raining and theres only one umbrella, it goes to the woman.
If theres only more chair, its supposed to go to the woman




People always say how its misogynistic to use the words Š—“bitchŠ— ad Š—“cuntŠ— about womenŠ—_.but what about when said words are directed towards men? By women? And what about all of the male gender-specific terms, lke asshole, prick, douchebag, etc? why donŠ—Èt people have a problem with these terms?

The answer is simple- because people do not see anything wrong with directing negativity towards males. Degrading and insulting males isnŠ—Èt seen as a Š—“badŠ— thing. 

Its as if being female gives you an automatic impunity from certain hardships and treatment that men donŠ—Èt need or deserve.

People hate seeing a woman starving, or in poverty, or struggling. But people couldnŠ—Èt care less about men in the same situation

we turn our NFL fields pink because breast cancer affects women.

european countries don't give the HPV vaccine to boys to prevent throat cancer because they arent girls and dont mater as much.

routine infant male circumcision is allowed because boys are the only ones affected.

no one points out that having higher retirement ages for men in many european countries violates the European court of justice' ruling against ANY legal disparity between genders because men are the ones with the unfavorable position.

no one asks if forcing all 18 year old boys to join the military for 1-2 years in said european countries might not be espousing of the principles of gender equality, because only boys are affected.

but if you imagine the reverse....

i read a post from a feminist that said ""you do realize that sexism aganst men does NOT exist right? thats not how this works.""

...but what is ""this"", i wonder?


this is what male sexism is...the tendency to ignore, rationalize, justify or fail to even recognize systemic injustice and disparities that affect males.

in most peoples minds, sexism against males just ""doesnt count."" its not that people dont care, its that people's brains literally do not compute the concept of discrimination against men

letting""ladies go first"", or passing a special bill to increase research for heart disease and cancer and women goes uncontested by the general population.

a charity for women or girls would be lauded as a heroic act of human rights and decency.

a charity for men and boys would be a medieval, misogynistic hate project.

our society teaches women=good, men=bad, and im seeing the effects more and more.

how much longer will it be until federal research funding for prostate cancer is cut completely? or when colleges are 75% female? or when all boys have to go through special ""gender sensitivity training"" as children to learn to respect women and girls (without the reciprocal, of course.)

Went to my doctor this week because I noticed small bumps on my foreskin and thought I might have an STD, even though its been a year of no sex.

He wasn't a 100% sure, but said I might have HPV aka genital warts. Referred me to an Urologist because they see junk a lot more than a general practitioner, and sure enough I found out this afternoon I have HPV.

I am going to get the vaccine and have the very small bumps (no larger than a period at the end of sentence) frozen and/or cauterized off, but this viral infection is a permanent thing. Even if I have the warts removed and go through the vaccine (I think you get 3 shots total over a few months), am I ever going to be 100% free of this? (Also, something like 75% of people have it?)

I was gonna go to the gym this afternoon after work like I usually do every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, but I'm so distraught and devastated by this that I'm sitting in my room doing nothing. I now realize that all my future dates and partners, when it gets hot and heavy I'm going to have to tell them, ""I'm sorry, but I have HPV. I got the vaccine and treated the symptoms, but if you're not comfortable with this, we don't have to continue.""

The most recent time was during sex - not necessarily rough but with a man larger than any I had ever been with and the bleeding was very minimal (I didn't see it, my partner just mentioned it).

I've had unprotected sex with one male partner since my last STI test, and I have the HPV vaccine. Call lines and advice chats always tell you to go get tests any time you have any concern about anything. Then my GP or the free sex health clinic tells me I'm low risk and it's basically a waste of time. 

When should I actually get tested? How often should the bleeding occur? I've also heard bleeding during ovulation is common. And when I go, who should I go to? My GP or the sex health clinic? I have no other symptoms, besides the yeast infection.

I think it's time for me to stop worrying about making this perfect and just put it out there as a reminder.

My past few weeks (and months if you count putting up with the symptoms developing before the diagnosis) have been occupied with a close relative coming down with oral cancer.  As if you needed to hear it, oral cancer *really* sucks!  It actually turns out this particular one is most likely from smoking but HPV is now such a common and increasing cause that the referral went to a HPV specialist first.  (Or, look at it this way, it's now *so* common that they put a HPV specialist in charge of admissions for that whole department at the hospital.)

The symptoms are No Fun and the same either way, while HPV adds the opportunity to share the risk with your partner(s), and is also a risk for cervical cancer, so if you've been putting off getting the shot, here's your reminder.  In the US it's recommended and probably covered for females 26 and under, but it protects males too.

If you've already had the vaccine, keep an eye on the news or in touch with your doctor because it seems like there are newer versions coming out which cover additional strains.

...and if you're smoking, as bi folk are also apparently at higher risk for - well, yeah, tobacco's nasty on that front too, do what you can to minimize your exposure.  I've only managed to 'quit' 'over' to e-cigs and fell back on the regular ones for a bit during the stress of all this, but the verdict coming back has been a reason to think thrice about grabbing a real one.  The lucky victim had quit completely for 20 years before it hit - so yeah, try to knock it off before that.

He's in treatment now, the 'drama' phase is hopefully about over with, and fingers are crossed - just take whatever energy you would've spent on sympathy and go out and get the shot or spread the word instead, so maybe at least one other person gets spared this mess.",2/3/2016 20:22

My sister (Jackie) is conservative, fairly religious, and lives in the south. My niece (Nancy) went to a school with only minimal sexual education. My sister is much older than me and practically raised me, but I live across the country now. My niece stayed with me for a few months just to get out of the south for a bit. She has a boyfriend, and her mom thought they weren't having sex. In brief conversation I realized my niece was not using condoms because she was on the pill and took Gardisil (HPV vaccine), so she said there was no reason to do so. I told her my position (i.e., they should be using condoms) and explained why (most notably that he cheated on her at least twice--yes, we also talked about that). She said he told her condoms were too tight for him, so I grabbed one of my own condoms and put it over my head and blew it up with my nose to show her he is being melodramatic. 

Anyway, fast forward a few months. I'm hanging out with my sister and we were drinking and something came up and I told this story. By this point my sister is aware they are having sex but still won't talk about it because she wants to believe they aren't for whatever reason. My sister got livid. Her complaints were:

1. My niece shouldn't be having sex, and I should not ""encourage"" that. 

2. My niece should not be talking to an older male about sex, especially if she took sex ed.

3. My niece should have gone to her mom. 

4. I'm a ""pervert"" for talking to a 19-year-old girl about condoms and even worse for showing her that I have condoms. 

5. My last girlfriend was 21, so somehow I was trying to convince my niece that she should date an older man. 

The condom conversation in question was literally the only sex conversation we had, and my niece brought it up to me. Now my sister won't talk to me. My niece basically told her mom to screw off and that she was thankful that someone took the time to answer her questions. I'm sure her lying boyfriend isn't happy that he has to wear condoms now, though. 

My sister told our parents about this, and they aren't taking sides. They are ""disappointed"" in me for not discouraging sex, but they also are ""disappointed"" in my sister for the same thing. 

I am not sure what to do. I don't feel like I did anything wrong, but maybe it was a bit inappropriate? 

Any advice would be appreciated! We are supposed to have a family outing today, but I am thinking of not attending.

He asked if I wanted to start the three-injection HPV vaccine regimen because it protects against the very prevalent HPV (of course) in sexually active people.  I said ""fuck it, let's do it"" because I trust him and I guess better safe than sorry.  Now though, since I am not sexually active and potentially asexual,  I'm questioning my decision and the necessity of the vaccine.

Summarize: This guy is immune to HIV. He was part of the gay lifestyling community during the late 80s and early 90s when the epidemic hit and swept through the gay community like wildfire. Like most people back then in the gay community, he wasn't big on protection and had multiple partners who he later found out were positive.

Hilarious, guys. You're in top form today, Reddit.  

Here's a more reasonable response...
>Asking for volunteers who had relations with positive people in the past, but who are not infected?

The OP hasn't gotten a chance to respond to it yet, as of this writing. Thankfully, another Redditor helpfully has:
>The original Craigslist post:
Ok so I'm looking for guys who fucked lots of guys with AIDS, but don't actually have it. If you want you can drive down here and I'll draw your blood and inject you with some fake virus.

You can jack off too, but no touching each other I'm not gay. Also I've got a lot of fake crab meat and you can take as much as you want when you leave. Nothng wrong with it I just have too much. You might want to steer clear of HIV tests too for the foreseeable future because you will test positive, but you won't really be infected, honest!


>Seems legit

I have plantar warts that have not responded to cryotherapy+debriding, salicylic acid+duct tape occlusion+pumicing over the last 6 months to a year. I had the HPV vaccine in my late 20s and definitely had plantar warts as a kid (that were successfully resolved with home excision and salicylic acid).

After visiting a podiatrist 3/1/16, he wrote me a prescription for a compounded 2.5% 5-FU/35% Glycolic Acid lotion to dab daily with duct tape occlusion, which I began on 3/3/16. I am also taking between 440mg-660mg of Zinc Sulphate daily since three weeks ago.  

My questions is three-fold: 

1. All the studies with 5-FU in them for plantar warts began at 5% concentration compounded with salicylic acid. Should I ask him to up the percentage of the compounded medication to match the studies or is there proven efficacy at 2.5% with Glycolic Acid?
2. I know that decreasing my blood sugar levels will increase my circulation and immune response. Is there any medical evidence that all these treatments are a waste of time until I get my blood sugar down?

I'm writing because 2 weeks after the surgery, my urologist called me in to let me know that he sent the artifacts removed during surgery to a pathology lab and the results came back as Genital Warts.  

Leading up to this visit, I had begun to do some research into HPV, specifically what it might mean for myself and my girlfriend, as she recieved the Gardasil I had assumed that due diligence would entail inclusion in the pathology report of what strain of HPV this wart was a result of.  My logic was that this is information that we could take to my girlfriend's gynecologist to help come up with a plan for proceeding with our sex life while mitigating as much risk as we possibly can. 

As it turns out, the pathology report did NOT include info on the strain of HPV which lead to this wart.  I asked my urologist, and he said he would put in a request for such a test to the laboratory, but that we might be too late as the sample may have already been discarded already and/or we may have passed the window for test viability (sample expiration).   

My thinking was that we could determine the strain and compare that information to the list of strains covered by my girlfriend's Gardasil vaccine.  To me it seemed that this could help shed a little more evidence with regard to where this all came from.  For example, if this presentation of warts stemmed from a strain that is not covered, it would be possible that my GF was carrying it without symptoms, which isn't important other than alleviating my own guilt for possibly endangering her.  I honestly do not care if it came from her, but it might make me feel better.  

Another relevant point would be that I have had warts on other areas of my body in the past.  Foot, knee, and fingers.  Each time I have had these removed, they've never returned.  

As of now, we're waiting for confirmation that the pathology laboratory can in fact test for the source HPV strain.  My girlfriend has made an appointment with her OBGYN for a couple weeks from now to be tested for HPV herself.  There we will discuss safe sex practices.  In the mean time, we are abstaining from all skin-to-skin contact in hopes that she somehow dodged the bullet if my HPV strain is one NOT-covered by Gardasil.  Prior to now, we're in a long-term monogamous relationship and have not used condoms, as I got a vasectomy and prior to that we were both tested for all STD's for which testing was available.  

My questions:

First: seeing as how I am obviously susceptible to HPV symptoms, given my past history with non-genital warts, should I get the Gardasil vaccine to protect me from any of the covered strains I might not have already been exposed to?  I have seen some research indicating that even strains one is already exposed to can be less likely to flare up again after vaccination. I also know that my age means this would be an ""off-label"" use of the vaccine, not covered by insurance, but the cost is not a huge problem for me, as I would further value even just a little extra peace of mind. 

Second: is anyone familiar with AHCC as a treatment for HPV?  I read about this recently and it seems to have some genuine promise after a study by a medical university in TX.  I know that AHCC is specifically tied to immunity boosting, so I figure it can't hurt, say for leaving my wallet a little thinner each month.  

Third: Does anyone know if a strain test exists for warts removed surgically and sent to a pathology laboratory?  

Fourth: Can someone who has had the gardasil vaccine still carry the strands it protects against and pass them on to an individual not protected by the vaccine?  

Fifth: any advice beyond improved diet, exercise, and stress management for a stronger immune system.  

Thank you all very much.

Please Pray for Me,9,2yj13g,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayChristians/comments/2yj13g/please_pray_for_me/,7,1425993006,"Hello /r/gayChristians. This is my first post here. Not really sure why I came here but it's the only place that made sense. I'm not sure what to say so I'll just jump right in.  

I'm a 20 year old male in Mississippi just fyi. Not really an important fact but anyways. 

A week ago,  Tuesday,  I went to the ER not knowing what was wrong with me.  It turned out to be an anxiety attack. The doctors gave me a xanax and sent me on my way.  Prior to this I had scheduled a doctors appointment for the next day. Go in for my visit.  Get prescribed a mild anti anxiety drug due to the prior nights events.  Also find that I have anal genital warts (HPV). I took my anxiety meds and they completely killed my appetite.  I didn't eat for 2 days.  The next day, while working at the local grocery store,  I had a mild panic attack.  Not knowing what to do,  I made my way to the front of the store to check my blood pressure and heart rate at the machine by the pharmacy.  I never saw what my heart rate was because of the bright red reading of my blood pressure being the highest it's ever been.  I was told to go home and relax.  Well when I get to my apartment I realize all of my roommates have left for spring break already. This starts another mild panic attack. I got one of my neighbors to drive me to the house I used to live at because I knew there was an open room and people to keep me company.  I survived the weekend with high blood pressure and no anxiety issues.  Today I went to the doctor to get my blood pressure looked at and to let them take blood to test cholesterol and also for any vitamin deficiencies. My pressure was down so they couldn't give me any kind of treatment for it regardless of the consistently high readings over the weekend.  So I get a printout from my doctor about how to eat better and all that kind of stuff. Fast forward to tonight I'm researching hpv. 4 of the 40+ stains of hpv have been known to cause cancer. Unfortunately for men,  there is no test to determine what strain you have.  As I'm reading about anal cancer I realize I show most of the signs of it.  So now I've almost worried myself into another anxiety attack and gotten my blood pressure substantially higher than it was earlier.  I just don't know what to do any more. The past week had been the worst of my life.  Having gone astray from my faith,  I recently started praying again. I feel bad because that's what I usually do.  I get in a comfortable life ignoring my faith until something happens then I come back again only to fade out of it after. I just don't know what to think any more.  I'm terrified. I am calling my doctor in the morning to see what he has to say about the possibility of cancer.  But as of right now I'm laying in bed with high blood pressure and my heart beating faster than it should be.  I don't really know what to ask for except your prayers.  That's all I know to do at this point. Sorry if my story is scrambled and not the most logical,  but my head isn't very clear at this point. Thanks for reading if you made  it all the way through. I had to get this off my chest somehow. 

TL;DR: My health has been terrible this week and I might have cancer. Please pray for me.

Update:  Went to work today and had another mild anxiety attack. Went to the doctor and got some new meds that should be a little better for me. The doc said that cancer wouldn't develop from the HPV unless it was left untreated for many years. All of my blood work came back nornal except for my vitamin D levels so I'm taking vitamin pills daily now.  I got dose 1 of 3 of the HPV vaccine. Last night seems like such a different place now. God is truly great. I have to take a week or so off work and I'm headed to Florida for vacation tomorrow. So the next week will be pretty great for me.",10/3/2015 21:10
First ever experience and really worried/scared.,8,1vfvg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1vfvg6/first_ever_experience_and_really_worriedscared/,17,1389987929,"From browsing, I feel like these questions come up all the time but I wanted to submit my own to try to give myself some peace of mind.

I've only ever been into girls but recently decided it would be interesting to try something else. I can't ever imagine myself in a relationship with a guy but the thought of getting physical intrigued me. Not really knowing anyone or where to start, I downloaded Grindr a few days ago. I've been talking with some guys and one guy and I in particular hit it off pretty well. Decided to hang out last night and it turned into messing around. Being uninterested in anything romantic, we didn't kiss. Just jerked each other off. In retrospect I was NOT ready for what came next - emotionally or mentally - but he gave me a blowjob and fingered me using his saliva as a lubricant. I also ended up getting a decent bit of his cum on my hands.

Not only did the experience bring me to the realization that I'm not as interested in guys as I previously thought, but now I'm terrified I might have caught something. I talked with him before and even messaged him afterwards to let him know I was freaked out. He assured me he was clean and told me he gets regularly tested, the last test having been last Wednesday (about a week ago). He says he hasn't had any sex since then and told me the last time he had before the test was in early December.

He seems pretty cool and felt bad that I'd had a not so good experience. He told me he thought I was a cool guy and that even if I wasn't interested in fooling around, he'd like to stay friends. I'm inclined to think that I'll be fine but as a naturally anxious person I'm still unable to calm down. I feel so ridiculously stupid and wreckless.

I was hoping I could get some advice. I know I'll want to get myself tested but have no idea how or where to get it done and how long I'll have to wait to know 100% if I have anything. I live on campus at my university and the clinic probably offers tests. I understand insurance often covers these costs but as I've never been romantically interested in a guy, I've never discussed my curiousity with my family and simply can't have it showing up on records - neither party is even close to ready for that discussion. I was also hoping I could get some information on what kind of STIs/Ds I should be worried about. I've gotten the first injection for my HPV vaccine so I'd guess my risk is lower. I know without cuts on my penis HIV would be pretty improbable but the fingering with saliva worries me. I'm also worried about herpes or some other incurable disease (although the thought of having anything at all scared the absolute shit out of me).

I'm sorry for all the text but could really use some advice. I'm away from home for school and can't visit my doctor for any information.

Thanks, Reddit.
I'm sorry if I'm overreacting, I really am just terrified.

Edit: Thanks for the replies. I really do appreciate it. I didn't mean to insinuate or come off as thinking the gay community carries more diseases, just that hookup apps/sites are probably less safe than encounters that arise from getting to know someone as a friend/romantic interest before getting sexual - male or female.

Any ideas of where I could go for a decent/thorough/cheap screening?",18/1/2014 3:45

I am a 26 year old male in a monogamous relationship for the last 3 years. I gave my girlfriend HPV without knowing I had it (she was a virgin). I realized she had it after she went to the gyno and they confirmed via pap smear (The test was done about a year ago). The results came back that she has abnormal cells (LSIL). After the diagnosis, I found out I had genital warts, induced most likely by the HPV.
My girlfriend recently got another follow up pap smear about a month ago and the doctor wants to speak with her. My guess is that she will have to get either another follow up test or get a colposcopy.

That being said I have a few questions:

1. She received the HPV vaccine Gardasil when she was younger, which to my understanding protects her from the more serious strains. From what I have been reading, the HPV that causes Genital Warts is the low risk strain. Should I be worried that she is at a serious risk? Can she have a serious strain if I have the one that causes GW?

2. My understanding is that after about 2 years the immune system should naturally be able to cure it. Since we have been dating and having sex for three years, is this a cause for concern?

3. What is the best course of action for future screening? 

4.  Will this affect her ability to have children? Will this affect her children?


All in all I feel like total and utter shit. I know that its a very common condition but I feel like I just have my significant other a death warrant. I dont know what to do, I dont know where to go.

I am a cishet Arab female from an Arab country. Things are very different in my country than in the US and Canada etc.


I am studying abroad in the UK, and I have received a lot of training on sensitivity and active listening, and how to deal with people coming out or telling you they have problems with their sexual identity. I am also very good friends with a few gay, bisexual, and pansexual people here in the UK. Because of my friendships and my volunteer work, my male best friends from home have come out to me as gay. Several acquaintances that I've only spoken to a few times have come out to me as gay because they see that I am good friends with gay people here in the UK, which shows that they are very desperate for support!


How can I help them?


I know in other countries, you have LGBT+ icons and spokespersons who can stand up and fight for LGBT+ rights. In my country, this is not possible. My friends would be disowned if they came out. They would be social pariahs. It is still considered a mental disorder here!!! One of them wants to get the HPV vaccine but is too afraid (even the medics cannot be trusted to keep their mouth shut!!)



They hate themselves for being gay. One of them is very religious and has serious problems accepting his sexuality because of it. What can I do to help them?


I read some of the posts on this sub and a lot of them have to do with gay marriage..we are a long, long way from that, and I don't think we will get there any time soon.


What are some resources that can help me?


I want to change my community. I can do this because I am straight. My gay friends are too scared to speak up (and rightly so). But I am straight and my heterosexuality protects me from any bullying or harassment. So far, I have been posting photos and articles on Facebook that show that I am very LGBT+ friendly.

Sex: Male

I was having a look at the stats and it seems to a layman HPV kills almost as many men as women. Some places recommend guys my age get vaccinated although only girls dying are routinely given the vaccine in school and the NHS page on HPV vaccinations only seems to talk about women and girls dying from it so I'm not too sure if the science behind it being responsible for so many men dying is reliable or controversial.

I would have to get it privately, so it would cost  around Î£400. It would be money that has taken me awhile so save and was planning on getting a laptop with for uni next year so I don't just want to get it for the sake of it.

Multiple Warts appearing.,2,3ievlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/3ievlq/multiple_warts_appearing/,4,1440582716,"Hi, I'm a 20 male, Caucasian, 200lbs. No medications, no conditions, 5'7, perfectly healthy in every way.

I had a wart on my left hand and on my left big toe for a few years. They stayed there and never bothered me. The one on my big toe is rather huge but never hurt and no one sees my feet anyways so I didn't care.  Well recently (within this summer) I had a wart appear above the one on my left hand. I didn't think too much of it but decided to get some a wart stick. I started using that, them another one appeared below the original. Over the last few months more have appeared, one on my right palm, left heel, and between my left big toe and second toe.  I also had a build up of skin on my right thumb that's been there about a year. I thought it was a callous but it kept growing back whenever I. Clipped it off, which I thought was weird. So I put the wart cream on it, and it started to go down. Which means that I have 8 Warts that I know of on my body right now. They didn't start appearing until this summer.

I'm concerned because wherever I look online for what causes Warts, everything keeps saying HPV, but I have my vaccine for it and I'm only sexually active with my girlfriend who I have been with for just under 3 years. She was a virgin before me, and the only other girl I have been with, we lost our virginity's together. So I have not come in contact with any STDs.

This summer I moved across the country and lived on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, so I did move to a strange area. I am back home now.

Any suggestions? I'm going to go to the campus doctor when school starts.

Ps: I just remembered that I caught impetigo while out in Pittsburgh. That was in June and into July. I got that taken care of. My lymph nodes are still swollen but very very minimally. At best they're the width of my pointer finger. I have small hands. *I was on Valtrex, a generic steroid that I don't remember the name, and some Bacitracin.* that ended about 6 weeks ago.

Vaccines should not be supported in all cases. CMV,0,1pbxrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1pbxrs/vaccines_should_not_be_supported_in_all_cases_cmv/,41,1382931845,"Hello /r/changemyview! I'm excited for my first submission. I also know that reddit as a whole is probably the most staunchly pro-vaccine community I've ever encountered and, if I'm being honest, this post is somewhat inspired by the [AskReddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1pb7e3/what_is_one_fact_that_despite_being_100_true_is/) that cropped up recently. I've been meaning to post this for a long time, though.

Okay, so let me start by saying that I understand the urge to vaccinate everyone and that vaccines are only truly effective if everyone takes part. I will also acknowledge that I am by no means a medical professional and am probably less educated on the subject than many of you. So, those things are granted, no need to point them out. Now, as for my argument: I simply don't believe that vaccines are safe for everyone to use. Let me share a story with you:

In the summer before my junior year of high school, I was sitting in my basement playing video games one day when I felt a stroke of dizziness. I immediately turned the game off and went to get some water, only to find that I couldn't make it up the stairs. I fell over, head spinning, and called to my parents for help. They got me upstairs, at which point I threw up until there was nothing left in my stomach. I couldn't open my eyes without the world whirling by at an uncontrollable speed, so I kept my eyes closed while they took me to the emergency room.

What I'm describing is something many of you may have experienced: vertigo. If I'm being honest, writing that made me a little anxious. For some time afterward, I would be anxious any time I got dizzy for any reason out of fear that I was lapsing back into vertigo. Anyway, I got to see a doctor and underwent numerous tests including an MRI (note: I think the test had a different name, but I can't remember exactly what it was and I know that it bore heavy resemblance to an MRI. Just think of it as a head scan). They couldn't tell what the cause was, but they suspected that (you know where I'm going with this) the vertigo was caused by the vaccine I had received before getting vertigo. The vaccine was for HPV, which I guess is a fairly recent development for males. 

Whatever protection was offered by that vaccine was simply not worth it. I lived with vertigo for a month, unable to stand up for long periods of time, or really do much besides lay in bed and try to comfort my stomach to the point where I could hydrate myself. I do not wish that upon anyone. That's why I'm against mandatory vaccinations for all, and why I disagree with people who tout the efficacy of vaccines as 100% fact. For that to be the top comment on an AskReddit thread is plainly ridiculous. 

Just a couple more things to consider: (1) every time I went in to see the doctor for subsequent check-ups, a nurse or a doctor would tell me that I still needed to take the second installment of the Gardasil HPV vaccine. I would tell them what happened, and they would instantly agree that I should stay away from the vaccine - a far more rational approach than many redditors seem to take, no? Just throwing it out there - I have been told by legitimate medical professionals not to take that vaccine. 

(2) I am *not* against vaccination. A couple years after the vertigo, I willingly received the vaccine for meningitis. But I did research the crap out of it beforehand. I will consider future vaccines in the same way - with open-mindedness and a healthy dose of skepticism.

(3) I am *not* the only one who has suffered serious issues at the hands of this vaccine. I wrote a comment about this earlier, so I'm just going to reuse a link: [Here's](http://communities.washingtontimes.com/neighborhood/stress-and-health-dr-lind/2013/apr/10/us-court-pays-6-million-gardasil-victims/) an article about it. Even some simple Googling will probably clue you in to the damage this vaccine has caused. Hopefully, when reading about lives that have been lost, you can see why it angers me when reddit gives thousands of upvotes and awards reddit gold to people who spew this sort of condescending, 'scientific' nonsense.

Thanks for taking the time to read. Alrighty then, CMV!

EDIT: Well, I left for a very long time, but my view has been changed nonetheless. I'll leave the comments that I gave deltas here in case anyone comes back to this thread: [this one by /u/gtpm28](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1pbxrs/vaccines_should_not_be_supported_in_all_cases_cmv/cd194km) and [this one by /u/turole.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1pbxrs/vaccines_should_not_be_supported_in_all_cases_cmv/cd145i3) Thanks everyone!",28/10/2013 11:44

She really wants to have sex soon, and I've been putting this conversation off out of embarrassment and fear, but I know that it's a conversation that needs to be had. I would have wanted to be informed before sex by whoever gave them to me.

As I said though, it's a very embarrassing and tough topic for me to bring up. How and where should I bring this up? How would you want to be told to make you feel as comfortable as possible about the situation without immediately running away in fear?

Obviously I would like to mention how most sexually active people get some form of it in their lifetimes, and that the effects of the virus and the virus itself usually goes dormant in 18 months or earlier. Obviously a plus side to mention is that there is a vaccine she can get to prevent her from catching the strain that I have, and how it will protect her again other dangerous strains like the ones that cause cancer.

My girlfriend and I got into the conversation of vaccines. I came to find out she doesn't trust vaccines. This raised a bit of a red flag. She doesn't have the HPV vaccine and neither do I (I believe).

Sorry if this is a dumb question but considering I already have HPV, is it too late to get vaccinated? And if not, where can I go about getting the vaccine? ",21/2/2015 9:15
PSA: I Got the Gardasil Vaccine and Still Got HPV,7,1ak6bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ak6bt/psa_i_got_the_gardasil_vaccine_and_still_got_hpv/,18,1363681071,"Hi guys, I thought it would be helpful to share my experience since it's a relevant topic for everyone, but women especially.

I was vaccinated with the Gardasil vaccine when I was a teenager and understood it as a prevention against cervical cancer and HPV (a bit naive, but that's how it was explained to me as a young'un). Today, as a 22 year old, I just found out from my gynecologist that I have HPV. Fortunately, it's almost positively the mild strain that will not result in cervical cancer; it just clears up on it's own in a year's time (phew!). BUT, I was still a little flabbergasted that I could get HPV even with the full rounds of immunization I had as a teen. 

Here's how this all works as I understand it now, and a friendly reminder for all the sexually-active folks out there:

* Gardasil works to prevent the *serious* types of HPV that can turn into cervical cancer; it does **not** protect you from any and all types of HPV.
*It is impossible to test for the presence of HPV in males, therefore you can't know who gave it to you or when.

* While it is unlikely that you will pass it onto other females (the most common way to transfer is ""old-fashioned coitus"" as my gynecologist put it), it is still a risk nonetheless.

* According to the CDC, HPV is the most common STD and most sexually active males and females will get it at some point in their lives.

This means that Pap smears are REALLY important! If you are sexually active, get one done every year, for real. Had I followed one nurse's recent advice to only go once every two or three years (check to see if your doctor's office is switching to this policy), I would not have known.

Another note: since guys do not present symptoms, they may check out as STD-free, even on paper. This means that if you are in a monogamous relationship and are using other forms of birth control besides condoms (because that tends to happen in long-term relationships), you might still end up with HPV.

So ladies (and gents), be safe out there! Wrap it up and Pap it up, y'all.",19/3/2013 16:17

I'm male, 13, I have gotten all of my vaccines up to this point, not in school, but in hospital, as for my mother's request.
Papilloma is apparently for females, and in the past it was given to females only (I don't live in the USA)
My mom says that I'm not in danger of papilloma because I'm male, and that apparently there are stories of the vaccine causing seizures, and damage to the nervous system.

All the craze about anti-vaxxers got my worried about this vaccine, even tho the virus (desiese, whatever) shouldn't affect me. But I still don't want to harm anyone else either, and on that note, one of my friends in class who is female, is also not getting it.

Again, my mom is not an anti-vaxxer, she doesn't believe vaccines cause autism, and I got all of my vaccines up to this point.

"Prophylactic HPV vaccine in boys reduces high risk infections by almost 90%. Yet the vaccine's low utilization hinders population level impact, particularly in men.",52,6c3mxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/6c3mxf/prophylactic_hpv_vaccine_in_boys_reduces_high/,13,1495229427,"ASCO abstracts were released earlier this week. One study that particularly jumped out to me as particularly important was the work assessing the impact of prophylactic HPV vaccination on oral HPV infections among young adults in the U.S. I will be interested to see the presentation, but my intuition is that these results will put a lot of pressure on payers to start covering this vaccine for young boys.

Abstract:
> Background: The incidence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers has risen in recent decades among US men. The potential impact of HPV vaccines on oral HPV infections has yet to be evaluated in efficacy-trials or surveillance studies. Methods: To evaluate the impact of prophylactic HPV vaccination on oral HPV infections in the US population, we conducted a cross-sectional study among men and women aged 18-33 years (n = 2,627) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011-2014. We examined the effect of self-reported receipt of Š_Ç1 vaccine dose on oral HPV infection (vaccine-types 16/18/6/11) prevalence among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals. Additional outcomes included percent reduction in infection-prevalence among vaccinated individuals and population-level effectiveness of vaccination. Analyses accounted for the complex sampling design. Comparisons between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals were conducted using binary logistic regression, with adjustment for age, gender, and race. Statistical significance was assessed using a quasi-score test. Results: During 2011-2014, 18.3% of the US population aged 18-33 years reported receipt of Š_Ç1 HPV vaccine-dose prior to age 26 (29.2% in women and 6.9% in men; P< 0.001). The prevalence (population-weighted) of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was significantly reduced in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals (0.11% vs. 1.61%; P= 0.008), corresponding to an estimated 88.2% (95%CI = 5.7%-98.5%) reduction in prevalence. Notably, oral HPV16/18/6/11 prevalence was significantly reduced in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated men (0.0% vs. 2.13%; P= 0.007). In contrast, prevalence for 33 non-vaccine HPV types was similar (3.98% vs. 4.74%; P= 0.24). Accounting for HPV vaccine-uptake, the population-level effectiveness of HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was 17.0% overall, 25.0% in women and 6.9% in men. Conclusions: HPV vaccination substantially reduced vaccine-type oral HPV infection prevalence among young adults (ages 18-33 years) in the US population during 2011-2014. However, due to low vaccine uptake, population-level effectiveness was modest overall and particularly low in men.

A guy you're dating tells you he had genital warts in the past. How do you react?,7,6oxagd,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/6oxagd/a_guy_youre_dating_tells_you_he_had_genital_warts/,21,1500784823,"So imagine you've been dating a guy (mid 20's - [M26]), you've been talking for a few weeks, dates have been going well, you guys have some chemistry and get along well. On the 3rd/4th date he discloses that he had genital warts 6-12 months ago.


**History:** I found I had this condition from a girl I dated around a year ago, it was never a long term relationship as she was finishing college that year and moving back home (3-4 hours away from me). She was unaware that she had it, told me later when she found them. (We used condoms every time).


**Info:** Genital warts have no serious impact on my health, it's just a few small warts that go away shortly after treatment (they can recur) and only impacts my dating life. Girls have been receiving a vaccine (Gardasil) since 2008 (Australia), 2012 (UK) - (Unsure on US dates) which protects against the strains of HPV that causes 90% of genital warts.


How do you react, and would you consider getting the Gardasil vaccine if you liked the guy enough?


All opinions/answers are welcome, but as I am from the UK - Getting the opinions of a female in the UK will be extremely helpful! (please still answer even if you are not from the UK)


**Edit:** Women are able to get the vaccine up to age 26+, generally says to the age of 26 as they assume you've likely been exposed to HPV by that age.


TL;DR - How would you react if a guy you've been dating (things go well, multiple dates) disclosed he had genital warts 6-12 months ago - ",23/7/2017 12:40

*****
> The potential impact of HPV vaccines on oral HPV infections has yet to be evaluated in efficacy-trials or surveillance studies.

> Methods: To evaluate the impact of prophylactic HPV vaccination on oral HPV infections in the US population, we conducted a cross-sectional study among men and women aged 18-33 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011-2014.

> We examined the effect of self-reported receipt of &ge;1 vaccine dose on oral HPV infection prevalence among vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals.

> The prevalence of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was significantly reduced in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated individuals, corresponding to an estimated 88.2% reduction in prevalence.

> Accounting for HPV vaccine-uptake, the population-level effectiveness of HPV vaccination on the burden of oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was 17.0% overall, 25.0% in women and 6.9% in men.

> Conclusions: HPV vaccination substantially reduced vaccine-type oral HPV infection prevalence among young adults in the US population during 2011-2014.

I never got vaccinated for HPV...,7,2tkgsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2tkgsu/i_never_got_vaccinated_for_hpv/,13,1422175786,"Hi guys. Lots of posts lately on reddit about anti-vaccination in general. Let me start by saying that my upbringing was very light on sexual matters, so much so that I had to steal pads from my mom when my period started (couldn't discuss it with her) and I was sent off to college without being put on birth control first.

So anyway after seeing these posts it made me think of my own vaccination history, and I realized I've never been vaccinated for HPV. I remember going to the doctor when I was 14 to ask about it and he said it ""didn't make sense"" because I wasn't sexually active yet... so I never started the series and I haven't thought of it until now.

Is it too late do you think? Can I still get vaccinated? I'm over 20 now. Am I in a lot of harms way by not doing so?",25/1/2015 16:49
