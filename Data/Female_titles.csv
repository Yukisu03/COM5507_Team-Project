"My father didnt want me to to get HPV vaccine when I was 14 because ""only girls that are promiscuous need it"". I'm 18 now, should I get it?",33,9uhzzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/9uhzzs/my_father_didnt_want_me_to_to_get_hpv_vaccine/,110,1541483388,"My father is a medical doctor who is left leaning, proscience and feminism in most aspects. He isnt an ""anti-vaxxer"" and thinks holistic treatment as a substitute for science based medical treatment is dumb. However he is kinda conservative in some aspects, for example he hates tattoos and thinks casual sex is horrible for you. 

When I was 14 and my whole class were getting the shot I was the only one who's parents didnt approve of me getting it. Then he explained to me that the people who were under risk of getting cervical cancer/warts were girls that have multiple sexual partners, and since I'm not going to have that I dont need it. At that point I just said ok as I felt he knew best, and I wasnt planning on having multiple sexual partners even before he brought it up like that so it made sense to me.

Now I'm 18 and i'm still a virgin and am saving it for some guy special, do I still need the shot. Should I get it? Is my father wrong or right?

Edit: you dont know my father or what he has been through, please dont call him names just because of one mistake he made. It's one thing to say he is wrong, it's another thing to just insult him as that helps nobody and just hurts me."

"Citizen contacts Maryland Department of Health to find out why they are so keen to push the HPV jab on 11yo children, they cannot provide evidence, so he files a freedom of information request and discovers they've been bribed/lobbied by $91.6 million of washed Big Pharma money to market the vaccine",2636,97i2d2,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/97i2d2/citizen_contacts_maryland_department_of_health_to/,357,1534367174,"Josh Mazer is pro-vaccine, but wants vaccines to be based on sound scientific evidence and not to cause more harm than good, he also believes in providing informed consent on the risks/dangers of each vaccine.

His journey began after a school nurse approached him and explained how she was being ""forced"" against her own sound judgement to market the HPV vaccine to 11- and 12-year-old school children, Josh decided to find out more.  

The nurse showed him letters from Maryland Department of Health outlining the new policy.  He first contacted Dr. Jinlene Chan, who had signed the letters, she could not provide evidence to back up the need for the vaccine.  He then contacted Dr. Ken Lin Tai, director of the Cancer Control and Prevention unit at the Department of Health, but she couldn't provide any evidence either.  Finally he met with Dr. Howard Haft, deputy director of the Maryland Department of Health who said it was CDC, yet CDCäó»s policy is to not take positions on state-specific legislation.

Suspecting that there was something else going on behind the scenes, in April 2018 he filed a Public Information Act request with the Prevention and Health Promotion Administration only to discover that the Maryland health department had received $91.6 million pharma funded non-profits to promote the HPV vaccine in Maryland.  

Keep in mind that Big Pharma can skip taxes by saying they are donating to non profits / 'charities' which they control, as we see they are then using this 'washed' the money (which should have been paid in taxes) to lobby/bribe government officials, who in return reward them by setting up unscientific pushes for dangerous Big Pharma products.  These non profits / 'charities' are also used to misinform the media about whatever the latest 'health crisis' is and why the latest dangerous Big Pharma products are 'essential' to save the day.

Josh wanted to find out more about the supposed HPV 'health crisis', so he met with Dr. Pete Doshi, assistant professor of pharmaceutical health services research at the University of Maryland.  Dr Doshi said he was unaware of any HPV 'health crisis' and explained that 98 percent of HPVs clear the body naturally within a few years.  It was also confirmed that Marylandäó»s rates of cervical cancer were in decline for years prior to introduction of the vaccine; the vaccine itself has never been proven to prevent cancer.  It was noted that HPVs are sexually transmitted, an important fact not disclosed in the health department letter.

Josh warns ""The approach being used by our state to prevent HPV cancer seems to be centered on fear mongering the dangers of the disease and over selling the potential benefits of the vaccine. The entire effort seems to be more a sales campaign than a disease prevention program."" He then points out that the vaccine itself has been proven to have the capacity to kill healthy individuals ""The harm that may arise is tragically illustrated by the death in 2008 of Sparks resident Christina Tarsell after her third HPV shot. The U.S. Court of Federal Claims decision September of 2017 states the preponderance of evidence demonstrates the shot series caused the fatal arrhythmia that took Christinaäó»s life.""

So in short:-  

1. Big Pharma skip their taxes donating to lobbyists disguised as charities, thereby washing the money
2. The lobbyists bribe government health officials
3. In return unscientific and dangerous products gets mandated by government
4. People are made sick from the mandated products, meaning they buy more Big Pharma drugs to treat their symptoms
5. Rinse and repeat

I have been seeing a lot of stuff popping up on Facebook about the HPV Vaccine causing issues for over 600 Irish girls since 2010. A lot of what people are posting seem to just be articles and the parents of these kids saying that their symptoms started around the time of the vaccinations. Some cases being relatively severe such as girls going into early menopause and ending up in a wheelchair. Other cases of mild pains or headaches etc.

I've been searching for the past few days looking for any peer reviewed studies or medical papers published highlighting the compounds that are causing these complications and how they are effecting the human body. So far I have found nothing substantial.

To me it would seem that this has become a bit of a hysteria thing among anti vax people, but as the symptoms are so vast that it would be hard for me to associate all these cases to the vaccine. Surely there would be  some common symptom that we would see from person to person.

Can anyone point me in the direction of some medical or scientific research on either side of the argument please? I want to hold off on forming a full opinion until I know more about the vaccine and it's side effects.

I am very pro vaccination but if people are concerned these concerns need to be highlighted and investigated to allow people to make the most informed decision they can possibly make.

Back when I was a first year college student I met a girl that piqued my interest, and after a few weeks of hanging out we got together. Shortly thereafter we agreed to become exclusive, great I thought, my very first girlfriend, and she's a solid 8/10 (I'm a 6-7 depending on the day), studying a respectable field (she was studying in the healthcare field), and from a wealthy family no less. I was crazy about this girl, I know that love is just a chemical imbalance in the brain but damn it felt real at the time.


About 4 months in she became a bit distant and avoided talking about it, just saying she'll miss me over the summer break from school (lived over 20 Hrs apart but attended the same college). Being the perpetually broke college student that I was I tried to make her feel better but there's only so much a $20 meal here and there does i guess.


Summer break comes and 4 weeks in I notice a few bumps on and around my junk, WTF. Doc tells me I have contracted HPV and should notify any previous partners. I do some research and the timing of my ''outbreak'' means it is very unlikely that she had it prior to our being together.


At this point I should note that I lost my virginity to her and even now 7 years later I have never been with anyone else other than the occasional clothes on make out sesh. Anyway I called her that day and all she said was ''I'm sorry that happened to you''. Furious, I told her that I'd not had any sexual contact with anyone else PERIOD. She has no answer to that and I ended the call before I got even angrier. needless to say but we stopped seeing each other.


Got treated a number on times and now have scarring all over my junk and reduced sensation from all on the liquid nitrogen applications. Now I have and increased risk on various mouth, throat and genital cancers and no woman will touch my dick (not that I blame them). I've tried dating a few times since this happened 7 years ago but when things start to get physical I stop and explain the situation(obviously) and they never see me again (fair enough, had I known that same thing I'd do the same). Having this talk with a woman is the most humiliating thing and pisses me off so much every time (3 and counting). This is even more frustrating for me as I have a prestige career in a booming industry making decent money, I wouldn't be un-dateable  if this whore had kept her legs closed.


Living with this much anger the past several years has crippled me emotionally, I've yet to find an outlet for my rage and it's slowly grinding me down. Honestly at this point I'm always operating on a low boil of rage and really need something to change before I either flip out on some random person, or lose what is left of my personality and shut down completely. 
Advice here would be most welcome.


TL;DR

first ever gf cheated on me when I was 18, gave me a lifelong STI, leaving me an angry, bitter, and un-dateable mess."

All the craze about anti-vaxxers got my worried about this vaccine, even tho the virus (desiese, whatever) shouldn't affect me. But I still don't want to harm anyone else either, and on that note, one of my friends in class who is female, is also not getting it.

**""If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed the the truth"" --- Carl Sagan**

**äóìI  would never give my daughter,  or my son the shotäó_ This is a massive PR  event by the company that  makes Gardasil, and the same is the truth  for the company that makes  Cervarixäó_ I think one needs to do a lot of  research, and I think parents  are in the best position to do that.äó äóñ** Dr. Christopher Shaw äóñ University of British Columbia

This  is a great point, and one that was  further emphasized byŒæDr. Peter  Gotzsche, co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration, the worldäó»s foremost  body in assessing medical evidence.

**äóìThe  main reason we take so many  drugs is that drug companies donäó»t sell  drugs, they sell lies about  drugs. This is what makes drugs so  different from anything else in lifeäó_  Virtually everything we know  about drugs is what the companies have chosen to tell us and our  doctorsäó_ the reason patients trust their medicine is that they  extrapolate the trust they have in their doctors into the medicines they  prescribe.**

**The  patients donäó»t realize that, although their doctors may know a lot  about diseases and human physiology and psychology, they know very, very  little about drugs thatäó»ve been carefully concocted and dressed up by  the drug industryäó_ If you don t think the system is out of control,  please email me and explain why drugs are the third leading cause of  deathäó_ If such a hugely lethal epidemic had been caused by a new  bacterium or a virus, or even  one-hundredth of it, we would have done  everything we could to get it  under control.äó**Œæ ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dozpAshvtsA))

The  HPV Gardasil vaccine is at the top of the list when it comes to  controversial vaccines. Despite its supposed safety and necessity, new  information is showing us that this may not be the case, and that its  purported safety might be a result of a very heavy, and what now seems  to be unethical, marketing campaign.  That being said, itäó»s still taboo  to question vaccine safety, which is  extremely confusing because there  are a number of peer-reviewed  publications, along with hundreds of  scientists and researchers in the  field, who are dedicating their lives  to creating awarenessŒæabout the fact that vaccines arenäó»t really as  safe as theyäó»re marketed to be.

äóì**When  one looks at the independent literature, so studiesŒæwhichŒæare not  sponsored by the vaccine manufacturers, so with relation to Gardasil  there have been several reports documenting multiple sclerosis and  encephalitis, which is brain inflammation, in girls who have received  their Gardasil vaccine. So just because a study sponsored by the  manufacturers does not identify problems with the vaccine does not  necessarily mean that the vaccine is safe. In fact if one looks at the  manufacturer studies, theyäó»re often not designed to detect serious  adverse events.äó**

Multiple  Deaths have also been caused as a result of the HPV vaccine.  Researchers from Mexicoäó»s National Institute of Cardiology pored over 28  studies published through January 2017, containing 16Œærandomized trials  and 12 post-marketing case series pertaining to the three human  papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines currently on the market globally. In their  July 2017 peer-reviewedŒæ[report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28730271),  the authors, Manuel Martí_nez-Lavin and Luis Amezcua-Guerra, uncovered  evidence of numerous adverse events, including life-threatening  injuries, permanent disabilities, hospitalizations and deaths, reported  after vaccination with GlaxoSmithKlineäó»s bivalent Cervarix vaccine and   Merckäó»s quadrivalent or nine-valent HPV vaccines (Gardasil and Gardasil   9).

Although there are many  safety concern issues, aluminum has continued to be prevalent,Œæ**despite  the absence of any appropriate safety toxicity studies proving that  itäó»s safe to inject this heavy metal into a fetus or young infant, let  alone  an adult.** A recent study found some of the highest brain  aluminum content ever measured in a human being within the brains of  several  deceased autistic people. Another recent study found that  aluminum does not exit the body when itäó»s injected, it actually travels  from the  injection site into distant organs and into the brain, where  it  eventually ends up staying.

Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A, DOI: 10.1080/15287394.2018.1477640  


**ABSTRACT** Birth rates in the United States have recently fallen. **Birth rates per 1000 females aged 25äóñ29 fell from 118  in 2007 to 105 in 2015. One factor may involve the vaccination against  the human papillomavirus (HPV). Shortly after the vaccine was licensed,  several reports of recipients experiencing primary ovarian failure  emerged.** This study analyzed information gathered in National Health and  Nutrition Examination Survey, which represented 8 million 25-to-29-year-old women residing in the United States between 2007 and 2014. **Approximately 60\% of women who did not receive the HPV vaccine had  been pregnant at least once, whereas only 35\% of women who were exposed  to the vaccine had conceived. For married women, 75\% who did not  receive the shot were found to conceive, while only 50\% who received the  vaccine had ever been pregnant.** Using logistic regression to analyze  the data, the probability of having been pregnant was estimated for  females who received an HPV vaccine compared with females who did not  receive the shot. **Results suggest that females who received the HPV shot  were less likely to have ever been pregnant than women in the same age  group who did not receive the shot. If 100\% of females in this study had  received the HPV vaccine, data suggest the number of women having ever  conceived would have fallen by 2 million. Further study into the  influence of HPV vaccine on fertility is thus warranted.**

> More girls from grass-roots families are expected to benefit from a vaccination scheme aimed at preventing one of the deadliest cancers affecting women, as the Community Care Fund extends its coverage.

> The fund will now provide free HPV - for human papilloma virus, which causes cervical cancer - vaccines to girls aged nine to 18 from families benefiting from the Working Family Allowance Scheme, which was formerly known as the Low-income Working Family Allowance Scheme, according to an announcement on Tuesday.

> While the pilot scheme has served 12,300 girls to date, the figure is less than half of the 31,000 young women expected to benefit from the expanded scheme.

> Originally, the scheme provided free vaccines only to girls aged nine to 18 benefiting from the Comprehensive Social Security Assistance, and female pupils receiving the full grant under the STAS. Following the changes, the scheme has been renamed the Cervical Cancer Vaccination Pilot Scheme - with the word &quot;Free&quot; dropped from its title.

> Delays in approving HPV vaccines in mainland China force women to seek shots in Hong Kong.

> &quot;If it is a medical necessity, then it is not a poverty alleviation measure,&quot; Choi said, adding that the cervical cancer vaccination could be handled by the Department of Health instead. The Department of Health currently does not provide HPV vaccines, while the vaccination could cost more than HK$3,000 at private clinics.

Edit: I am not hesitant because of her age. Quite the contrary, I am very open with my kids about sex. 
Also I want to add that I am familiar with HPV, having had it along with LEEP and a hysterectomy. 
My hesitation comes directly from the side effects that have been reported, and those that have been linked but not fully examined. I am simply conflicted about which risky future I should choose for my daughter. The possibility of a horrible reaction to the vaccine, or the possibility of cervical cancer. Neither seem like a great choice. "

> Japan&#039;s health ministry could find no evidence the vaccine was to blame, but take-up rates have plunged from more than 70% to less than 1%. &quot;With this vaccine we could prevent many deaths from cervical cancer in Japan, but we are not taking the opportunity,&quot; Muranaka said.

> Delegates in Dublin outlined one possible solution that has been adopted in Austria, where doctors now give the HPV vaccine to both girls and boys.

> For their part, scientists insist that the HPV vaccine is safe and effective.

> This point was emphasised by Prof Helen Bedford of University College London, who said that although the HPV vaccine had only been in use for around a decade, its benefit were already being observed: &quot;Impressive data are already accumulating to show the impact of the vaccine in reducing HPV infections and pre-cancerous cervical lesions.""

Mods, please forgive me if it is and just delete it. I really don't mean to make your jobs harder.  
Here is my question- I had my first visit to an OB/GYN today.  He put me on birth control (I had some of fears about it, but realized they were unfounded) but said unless I thought something was wrong, since I am not sexually active (I'm 24 and waiting for marriage) there was no reason for a PAP smear or pelvic exam. I was happy with that because other than my period problems, I don't think there is anything wrong.  
Of course, I got home and started wondering if I should have gone ahead and had him examine me- it's not like I'm shy, you know? I was just trying to avoid physical discomfort.  So I got a mirror and looked at my vagina- for the first time, really, and now I'm worried. Some areas looked better than others, but I've never made a habit of studying vaginas and so I don't know what's normal.  Is there a guide or something somewhere?

I'm still currently telling all my partners, but it is pretty tough to deal with sometimes. Just the thought lingers at the back of my mind, to the point where it can drive me crazy. I see a lot of mixed opinions on it, curious to see what you guys think."

Apparently it's not the wart-causing strand but it is the cervical cancer-causing one. Obviously I was a little hesitant when I first heard about it, as I'm not really as experienced as her.

I've read it's pretty common but I still don't know if I should pursue a relationship with her. If things don't work out, what if I give it to a future partner? I also know I'm a big fan of receiving oral, so does this mean that can't happen now? I guess I'm just really hesitant and could use some advice.

> Regardless of where one falls on this debate, new research from Australia shows good news: Men who are unvaccinated for HPV are receiving protective benefits from the women who are vaccinated.

> The team studied 511 heterosexual males aged 16 to 35 who were unvaccinated for HPV and had sex with at least one woman.

> Penile swab samples were collected and analyzed for HPV DNA. They found that the younger men were less likely than older men to be infected with the HPV strains targeted by the vaccine.

> As shown, the difference in prevalence of vaccine-targeted HPV strains between younger men and older men was large and statistically significant.

> One could argue that the reason younger men have a lower prevalence of HPV is because they haven&#039;t yet had enough sexual encounters to become infected.

> Other data show they were still being exposed to HPV since the prevalence of HPV strains not targeted by the vaccine was roughly the same in both the younger and older men.

In Australia, where the HPV vaccine was introduced first, cases of genital warts in several age groups have plummeted among those who were given the vaccine.

A Judicial Watch Special Report Examining the FDAäó»s HPV Vaccine Records,25,55dilb,https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/55dilb/a_judicial_watch_special_report_examining_the/,6,1475362504,"Executive Summary
In May 2007, Judicial Watch submitted a request to the FDA under the Freedom of Information Act for all records concerning Merckäó»s new anti-HPV vaccine, Gardasil.

After Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit in October 2007 to compel record production, the FDA finally released four sets of d
ocuments, the last in June 2008. These records detail
the development and expedited approval of Gardasil. The documents include patent and licensing memoranda, test reports for the vaccine, and the final briefing document on
Gardasil submitted to the FDA in April 2006, one month before the vaccine was approved. The FDA also produced 8,864 VAERS reports. Judicial Watch uncovered a transcript of Merckäó»s May 18, 2006, meeting with the Vaccines and Related Biological
Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), at which the vaccine received a unanimous vote of approval.

Analysis of the records shows:
äó¢Gardasil is a prophylactic, preventative vaccine and will not treat pre-existing HPV infection. It is not a cancer vaccine or cure.
äó¢Gardasil is marketed as a vaccine that prevents cancer, but it äóì . . . has not been evaluated for the potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity.äó
äó¢Gardasil is not 100% effective against all HPVs. It is designed to protect against only four strains of HPV, even though there
are over thirty strains including at least fifteen that can cause cancer.
äó¢While Gardasil is the most expensive vaccine ever to be recommended by the FDA, its long-term effectiveness is unknown and could be as brief as only two to three years.
äó¢During testing, an aluminum-containing placebo was used. Aluminum can cause permanent cell damage and is a reactive placebo, unlike most standard saline placebos. This means that tests of Gardasil may not have given an accurate picture of safety levels.
äó¢Although some states are considering making it mandatory for young girls to get the Gardasil vaccine, it has only been tested with one other vaccine commonly given to children. There are ten commonly administered adolescent vaccines.
äó¢Gardasil is still in the testing stages, and will not be fully evaluated for safety until September 2009. VAERS reports show that as many as eighteen people have died after receiving Gardasil

Popped a pill and was having a good time. Towards the end of the night we ran into a group of people who were very nice. Partied with them throughout the night. One of the girls (22F) made a move on me. Told her that I had a gf, she apologized and told gf but she didn't really care about it. Same girl invited us to an orgy this Saturday. We both agreed to go and so did my girlfriend's friend (23F) . We exchanged numbers with her and her friends and left the rave. Woke up Sunday morning to a group text with multiple FAQs about the orgy. Info is as follows:

Orgy will consist of 26ish people (75% girls, 25% guys)
BYOB and food
Pictures of everyone were required from everyone for reference
Provide your own condoms and sex toys
Don't bring anyone who will just ""watch""
Don't force anyone to do ANYTHING against their will

I'm still a little surprised we got invited. The first and most obvious question is should we go? I could take it or leave it honestly, but it'll be a nice experience and not to mention a check in the box. My next question is, for those who've been in orgies before, what are some things I could do to prepare myself? Serious answers only please!

In [2017 it was reported](https://www.statnews.com/2017/08/24/hpv-vaccine-teens/) that rural areas are not as willing to accept the HPV vaccination as urban ones, from the article â€œthe vaccination rate against human papillomavirus, or HPV, was 16 percentage points lower in rural areas than urban areas.â€

We also see that the [average age of new moms is rising](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinekee/fertility-rate-declining-urban-rural), this again fits in with the HPV vaccine causation theory as the vaccine has been going around high schools since late 2007, older women will have missed it unless they made a special effort."

>Birth rates in the United States have recently fallen. Birth rates per 1000 females aged 25â€“29 fell from 118 in 2007 to 105 in 2015. One factor may involve the vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV). Shortly after the vaccine was licensed, several reports of recipients experiencing primary ovarian failure emerged. This study analyzed information gathered in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which represented 8 million 25-to-29-year-old women residing in the United States between 2007 and 2014. Approximately 60% of women who did not receive the HPV vaccine had been pregnant at least once, whereas **only 35% of women who were exposed to the vaccine had conceived.** For married women, 75% who did not receive the shot were found to conceive, **while only 50% who received the vaccine had ever been pregnant.** Using logistic regression to analyze the data, the probability of having been pregnant was estimated for females who received an HPV vaccine compared with females who did not receive the shot. **Results suggest that females who received the HPV shot were less likely to have ever been pregnant than women in the same age group who did not receive the shot.** If 100% of females in this study had received the HPV vaccine, data suggest the number of women having ever conceived would have fallen by 2 million. Further study into the influence of HPV vaccine on fertility is thus warranted.

Gee golly whiz, looks like female promiscuity **still** has a price tag -- HPV and cancer risk -- or HPV Vaccine and sterility risk.
-

(Also, guarantee you this is going to end up resulting in class action lawsuits -- all those teen girls who were vaccinated {as minors, with or without parents & doctors pushing it} -- will now have a {arguably even somewhat VALID} claim that they were not informed of the sterility risk... which of course they weren't.  Gonna be interesting what ""price"" is put on never-conceived ""fetuses""; among other things I guarantee you lefty-feminist-types will, once again, reveal their hypocrisy {un*conceived* children will suddenly be worth ""millions"" in compensation; unborn children who have been ""aborted"" as inconvenient ...they're all just parasitic blobs of tissue.}.)

---
EDIT: Despite the conclusion that most will leap to -- that it is the 'Vaccine' itself that causes the sterility risk... that of course **isn't** necessarily true.  It could just as easily be that -- having gotten the *'sex w/o consequences' vaccine shot*\* -- the vaccinated women ended up being MORE promiscuous, and thus got infected with more (other) STD's, many of which are known to cause problems that lead to sterility or fertility problems. (This study doesn't say whether they gathered data on other STD's the women may have been infected with, nor does it seem likely that they even *tried* to gather data on number of sexual partners, or number of couplings {i.e. ""sexual infection potential"" events}, however unreliable such data would probably be).

\* Regardless of it's fallaciousness, it is my understanding that this is what many young women (especially teen girls) actually think & believe about, and how -- broadly paraphrased -- they have been referring to, the HPV vaccine."

I had the HPV Vaccine (Gardasil shot ) back in 2011 when I was 18. I had the 3 separate shots.  

Last year I had an abnormal Pap smear (abnormal cells in cervix, I believe), but no HPV was detected. Due to the abnormal Pap, my doc wanted me to get a pap again in a year. 

This year/time, I had the opposite results.  My pap came back normal; which I was happy about. However, now HPV was detected.  The nurse told me my ""High-Risk HPV Strain is positive.""   

I have a few questions. 

I am aware that the HPV Vaccine was not going protect against all kinds of HPV. I believe the one in 2011 protects against 4 of the big ones. 

1. If the Vaccine protects 90% of cases of strain 16 and 18,  what are the chances I have one of these strains?  Is it likely I have one of the other high-risk strains that was not protected from the Vaccine?  (Is it likely I do not have  strain 16 or 18
?) 

Due to my pap currently being normal: 
2. I'm assuming my immune system was strong enough this past year to help the cells in my cervix go back to normal. Is this the correct assumption? 
3. Since HPV is now present,  is the virus active?  Even with no cell changes?  

4. If my cells are currently normal, hypothetically,  does this lower transmission rate if I were to engage in sexual intercourse or sexual behaviors? 

5. What can I do to help combat the infection or to keep my immune system strong (so that they do not change to abnormal or atypical cells)? 

My hope would be that when I have my pap and HPV test in a year from now that the cells will remain normal (a normal Pap), and, perhaps if I keep my immune system strong, that the HPV will not be detected.  
At the least, to not have cell changes.  

-Nonsmoker
-No kids
-Currently single 


( Side note: I am pretty healthy overall.  I don't smoke, am at a normal weight for my BMI. I don't have any allergies that I know of.  I try to go to the gym a couple/few times a week and do weight training,  and I try to remain lightly active (walks, etc.)  I try to avoid fried foods, love fruit, and try to get in my veggies when I can..   try to keep up with my current protein intake too, etc.  I don't drink soda. I try to only have water .. and I usually do drink coffee on weekday mornings.   
I do go out and drink on weekends - more so lately since it has been nice weather. I would say once a week is pretty average for me. So when I do, I might have a few mixed drinks which are sugary).   I take birth control pills. I like them because they clear my skin but also as a a form protection when I am sexually active.  I also take Adderrall XR on weekdays, most of the time. 

I would really appreciate advice or insight about this.

>Yes, yes!! So now boys and girls go get your HPV vaccine series! Protective against HPV strains 6, 11, 16 and 18. Two strains (6 & 11) responsible for those pesky genital warts (such buggers) and amazingly also two strains (16 & 18) known to cause 70% of cervical cancers! I love science.

Eh?  You wouldn't force fat people who binge eat to get liposuction, would you?  Those people need to stop eating so damn much and get off their asses and exercise.  They *choose* to eat like a pig and endanger their own health, much like the females who *choose* to spend all their admission tickets at the amusement park to ride the cock carousel.  You can certainly choose *not* to do these things.  Why should other people have to inject this foreign substance into their bodies because of a subset of women who continue to slut it up and endanger their own lives in the process?  If they won't relent, just let natural selection do it's job of removing these women from the gene pool once and for all."

It seems like the majority of information about the vaccine on the web is still pertaining to women, so I wanted to get some input from guys who have had it. What has been your experience with getting the vaccinations and would you say its worth it? My only hesitation in getting it is that my insurance will not pay for it, so the cost would be out of my pocket. I've read that by the age of 26 you have cleared most HPV strains already, and so the vaccine may not be necessary.

Anyway, any input would be appreciated!"

HPV in men is on the rise. Oral sex is one of the causes of HPV, so it's likely that cases of HPV in men are increasing do to men giving women more oral sex.

HPV has been linked to various cancers in both men and women. Although more women die a year from HPV related cancers, a few thousand men a year die to.

Yet all we heard for the longest time was how the HPV vaccine should be free for girls...but no mention of boys. All national programs were aimed at girls, and obamacare provides free STD screening and testing....for female citizens only, after a massive lobbying push from national feminist groups.

Why don't male taxpayers have this same right? Why should I be denied something that might save my life just because of my gender? I thought feminists were AGAINST that kind of thing?

The fact that HPV can cause health problems in women was often used in pro-male infant circumcision arguments. So, it's ok to mutilate and slice up a child at birth in case an adult women doesn't practice safe sex? Needless to say, nobody will dream of saying we should start altering girls body's to protect male health later on in life.

So because its worse in females, its ok to ignore it in men? Just imagine the reverse- a disease that is worse for men, but still kills a few women to. Imagine if national policy was only helping men and ignoring the women, and imagine if large, national mens rights groups were backing it and pressed it into a national healthcare act."

Apparently 80% of women will contract HPV before the age of 50. This has nothing to do with whether you have casual sex with strangers or have a husband and kids, your husband can cheat on you (you can't control if someone cheats on you) pass on the virus and kill you. It's so scary to know this.

I've had an HPV vaccine when I was 16, I'm 23 now, but apparently the vaccine doesn't last forever (about ten years) and only protects against 4 strains of the disease. There are 100 strains. I'm still a virgin, and have never had a pap test since the whole procedure seems so invasive and scary. I've read terrible stories. Upon reading up on pap tests I've learned they are VERY inaccurate. 1000 women would have to have regular pap smear tests, for 35 years to save 1 women from dying of cervical cancer related to HPV. Many women get false positives and think they're healthy, and false negatives where they believe they are sick and get many unnecessary treatments too. :S

On top of all that, you don't need to have intercourse to get HPV, it's transferred by skin. Condoms don't help protect against HPV. So I guess if you get it it's just your bad luck and you die, right?

p.s. I may be a virgin now, but I do plan to have sex eventually, so despite using condoms, and getting a vaccination, i can still get HPV, get cancer and die right? I'm feeling depressed and actually crying. heh

My problem is now that I'm out and I want to try to actively date, I'm terrified. There is no way that I could lie about it because the thought of pretty much being able to give someone cancer terrifies me. The thought of getting to know someone and then being dropped once they get that bomb dropped on them scares me too.

Vaccinate your damn kids, or they'll vaccinate themselves the moment they get the chance.

EDIT: Wow this really blew up. Cool. 

For those of you saying this is an advertisement, yep, you caught me. Totally is. Big Pharma hit me up on Snapchat and said ""yo gurl, post on Reddit and tell all dem other females to prevent up to 16 strains of cancer thereby encouraging them to be sexually loose"". They even offered to pay me with a stick of gum and some dick pics. I couldn't refuse. Could you? 

But for real, guys. What the fuck? I'm literally just a girl who is happy because I exerted control over my own body, took my health into my own hands, and got a vaccine. I wanted some positive feedback for this so I posted about it. I wish I got paid. That would be cool. But I'll have to settle for some sweet, sweet karma.

Vaccines are not bad or scary. They save lives. Vaccinate yourselves, your kids, your grandma, your cat, your dog, your goldfish, and whatever the fuck else you can vaccinate. Stop being scared. Stop believing mommy bloggers and conspiracy theorists. Take care of your health and don't expose yourself to easily preventable but serious diseases. 

Vaccines are cool. Get them.

Non drinker and no drug use. Prescribed Atenenol and amitriptyline. Have Nexplanon birth control implant. I had the Gardisil (so?) vaccine, all three shots, in 2006-2007. Diagnosed with HPV in 2015.


I got my first period 2 months after I turned 11. From the start, my periods are very heavy with large blood clots/tissue passage. My periods were regular until my early 20's.  I became sexually active and started using birth control at age 15.  I don't remember what birth control I was prescribed at that time, it was a daily pill. It never lessened or caused by period to be lighter. Cramping was moderate but manageable.  I became pregnant despite the birth control at age 21, had a vaginal delivery, no complications from birth. During a routine ultrasound it was mentioned I had cysts on my left ovary but nothing more was ever said.  After my pregnancy I opted for an IUD.



The IUD caused severe cramping on the right side of my lower abdomen during my period. It feels like my organs are in a vice, begin squeezed. My periods were still very heavy and very irregular, sometimes with 2+weeks of bleeding with only a week or two inbetween bleeding times. After 3 years, I had the IUD removed and began oral birth control again. Between 2013 and 2015 I wasn't using any birth control, and in early 2016 I had the Nexplanon implant placed in my arm. 1 pregnancy, 1 live birth.



My periods are terrible. I have heavy bleeding, soaking thru a super/overnight pad in about 4 hours and I'll pass large amounts of tissue.  The vice like pain at times makes it hard to walk or move. I also have severe bloating and acne during the week leading up to and the week of.  My periods sometimes come every 2 weeks, sometimes come every 6 weeks.  My last 5-6 periods have been very dark blood, almost black, with the tissue passage for the first few and last few days appearing to be dried up/dehydrated.



I've brought these issues up with my doctors and am told it's the birth control. I'm still getting used to it, it's a common side effect, no reason for concern. I'm always told this without a physical exam or testing. Whatever birth control I used, it was always blamed.

It's going really well.  (Pretend I said that with a giant grin, because I did. We're insufferable. It's great!)

&#x200B;

Now for the fun/tricky part:  he has an unusual orgasm/arousal pattern for a man.  He's very sensitive and cums easily, but doesn't have to stop play.  He'll lose his erection, but not his sensitivity or interest.  He has almost always had 1-2 orgasms by the time I get his clothing off.  By orgasm 3-4, PIV is out of the question, but who cares?!  I wimp out and end play after several hours, but he's had actual orgasms roughly every 30 minutes, and leaks plenty of precum most of the way through.  Plus, after the first couple of orgasms, he's much too small to keep a condom on.  Our play is far from strictly genital focused, so we tend not to think about it, and it's too easy for that stuff to get everywhere.

&#x200B;

If it were just me, fine - any sperm that manages to make it through a copper IUD AND the pill probably belongs to some sort of god.  But him seeing other people - male and female - seems to be really good for both of us.  We don't want to be idiots and/or get a serious STD.  We've invested in preliminary testing, committed to ongoing testing, and we're excited to get the HPV vaccine now that it's approved for adults up to 45.  How much are we risking if we ignore the leaking dick in the room when it isn't actively penetrating anyone?  Are there ways to mitigate that risk?

Thank you!

British MRAs explain in which areas men are discriminated,69,9ca47p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/9ca47p/british_mras_explain_in_which_areas_men_are/,11,1535898578,"Summary of their 2015 manifesto:

â€‹

**1. HEALTH**

a. In the UK there are two national screening programmes for female-specific cancers, none for male-specific cancers, although as many men die from prostate cancer, as women die from breast cancer.

b. A public inquiry is required to identify viable strategies to improve menâ€™s health, with a view to developing a national menâ€™s health policy. An inquiry is required to consider prostate cancer specifically, with a view to introducing initiatives to increase survival rates dramatically. This will inevitably require a considerable increase in public funding of research into, and treatment of, the disease. A national screening programme for prostate cancer should be introduced as a matter of urgency. Men over the age of 40 should have their PSA levels measured annually.

c. Developing the capacity of individual men to improve, maintain and monitor their own health is vital. From pre-school onwards, information and advice should be delivered in a manner consistent with male viewpoints. This should incorporate health promotion, education, the personal development necessary to utilise services effectively, the self-confidence to request and accept help, and the ability to cope with changes in physical and mental functioning.

d. Boys should be given the HPV vaccine.

e. Hormone replacement therapy should be available on the NHS for men, as it is for women.

f. GP surgeries should allow people to register near to where they work, as well as near to where they live. At least one GP practise in each area should be open for everyone â€“ not just people registered with that particular practise â€“ until 21:00 on weekdays, and 09:00 to 17:00 on Saturdays.

g. More resources should be devoted to identifying men suffering from depression, and treating them appropriately.

h. More resources are required to diagnose and treat the mental health conditions of men in prison.

**2. MALE GENITAL MUTILATION**

a. Male Genital Mutilation on individuals under the age of 18 should be illegal other than on grounds of medical need. All MGM operations should be registered, the reason(s) for them being performed recorded, and the related information passed to the Department of Health for publication. Until MGM is made illegal, it should only be performed after the application of local anaesthetic. Only medical practitioners should be permitted to perform the operation, and only in registered medical premises. Men may choose voluntarily to have MGM performed on themselves any time after their 18th birthday.

**3. EMPLOYMENT**

a. The government should strive to reduce the male unemployment rate which is higher than the female unemployment rate and has been for many years.

b. There is another serious aspect to male unemployment:

\- Unemployment is known to be a key driver of marital breakdown,- Unemployment is also known to be a key driver of the high male suicide rate,- Suicide is the leading cause of death of men under 50 in the UK

**4. SUICIDE**

a. Male/female suicide rate differential in the UK nearly doubled between 1982 and 2012, from 1.69:1 to 3.3:1. Suicide is the leading cause of death of men under 50, 26% of men between the ages of 20 and 34 who die have committed suicide (only 13% of women in the same age band). A public inquiry should be held to explore the male suicide rate, and determine a practical strategy to reduce it. This should include measures to address the root causes of what drives men to take their own lives, as well as what is needed to better identify men at risk of committing suicide, and what essential support is needed.

**5. HOMELESSNESS**

a. Almost 90% of street homeless are men. The stream of young people moving into social housing after being in care would diminish rapidly if families were stronger, family breakdowns less common, and fewer young people placed in care in the first place. Our proposals on strengthening families by ending the â€˜winner takes allâ€™ system in the family courts would help reduce the problem of homelessness.

b. It is iniquitous that men forced out of their family homes after family breakdowns are deemed 'intentionally homelessâ€™, even when they have left their homes to escape abusive partners. Local Authorities should bear a responsibility for providing them with accommodation, if they are not in a financial position to afford accommodation.

**6. ARMED FORCES VETERANS' ISSUES**

a. Armed Forces veterans are being denied adequate support for dealing with mental health issues, including Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

b. It is unacceptable that a dual diagnosis is being used to deny veterans concurrent treatment for both mental health issues and substance abuse problems (generally alcohol). Resources must be increased to the point that all veterans with a dual diagnosis receive prompt and comprehensive treatment for both problems. Many veterans are not receiving the support they need following a â€˜dual diagnosisâ€™ of possible mental health issues and substance abuse. The NHS typically requires them to be â€˜cleanâ€™ for a number of months â€“ often six or more â€“ before becoming eligible for treatment. The substance being abused is generally alcohol, a depressant, which makes treatment more difficult. However, these men risked their lives for their country, and deserve the extra investment that would be required to treat men with dual diagnosis.

**7. FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME**

a. Victims of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome should be entitled to criminal injuries compensation from their mothers for inflicting Grevious Bodily Harm on the unborn child.

In 2014, a test case was brought by lawyers on behalf of a six-year-old girl. Three Court of Appeal judges were told that the 17-year-old mother was drinking â€˜an enormous amountâ€™ while pregnant, including a halfbottle of vodka and eight cans of strong lager a day. However, the judges ruled the girl was not entitled to criminal injuries compensation from her mother. In a later section of our manifesto, on the criminal justice system, we explore the issue of women often not being held accountable for their actions and inactions. If men were treated as leniently as women by the criminal justice system, five in every six men in British prisons wouldnâ€™t be there (according to evidence provided).

**8. ACCESS TO CHILDREN AFTER FAMILY BREAKDOWNS, CUSTODY ISSUES**

a. Fathers and paternal grandparents are being denied access to their children and grandchildren following family breakdowns.

b. Separated fathers should have reasonable access to children after family breakdowns

Around one in four children lose contact permanently with their fathers following family breakdowns, mainly due to the failure of the family court system to ensure them reasonable access. This is emotional abuse of children, fathers, grandparents and others. More than 90% of the parents denied reasonable access to their children by family courts are fathers, but we support the rights of all parents to be granted reasonable access to their children after family breakdowns. The combined effect of family breakdowns and an anti-male family law system has led to 24% of all British children having no contact with their fathers. These children are more likely to suffer disadvantage throughout childhood and adult life. The reluctance to reform this system among those who work in the industry (lawyers, judges, court staff, court experts) is driven more by financial self-interest than concern for the welfare of children. Family Law has become a multi-billion pound industry. We propose a simplified legislative model, intended to remove the need for the great majority of contested court proceedings in cases where parents have separated and are unable to agree the living arrangements for their children. (...)

**9. EDUCATION**

a. Proposal: the option of all-boy schools with all-male teaching staffs should be introduced for these communities that want them.

b. Women are given financial assistance denied to men, e.g. at Brunel University, only women doing one-year-long MSc courses in Engineering are given an additional Â£22,750.

The state education system has become ever more dominated by female teachers over many years. Between 1970 and 2010 the proportion of female primary and nursery school teachers rose from 77.4% to 87.4%. Over the same period, the proportion of female secondary school teachers rose from 45.4% to 62.3%. The state education system is run with the objective of advantaging girls over boys from their earliest years. In an interesting analysis, William Collins wrote of teachersâ€™ pro-female bias starting to create a â€˜gender education gapâ€™ in 1987/88, when â€˜Oâ€™ levels were replaced by GCSEs. The gap appeared for the first time that year concurrently with the introduction of continuous assessment by teachers. Predictably, the gap has led to women now taking the majority of university places (57% in 2012/13). The long-term trend for there to be less physical activity in schools is known to have a negative impact on boysâ€™ academic performance, contributing to the gap. A larger problem is the sexism of female teachers, which contributes even more. A study conducted by researchers at the London School of Economics found that boys have realised female teachers award lower grades to boys than to girls, theyâ€™re demotivated by this, and donâ€™t work as hard. Girls donâ€™t exhibit the same demotivation with male teachers. The growing influence of feminists in education is a disturbing but predictable development, following the feminization of the teaching profession. Karen Woodall wrote an article on the matter, â€˜Brainwashing Boys: Feminist Doctrine for the Early Yearsâ€™, following a speech given by Yvette Cooper, Shadow Home Secretary.

**10. PRISON SENTENCING**

a. Five out of six men in British prisons wouldnâ€™t be there, if men were sentenced as leniently as women for the same crimes.

b. The prison population in the UK is around 84,000. Over 80,000 of these are men. William Collins published a detailed article, â€˜UK prisoners: the genders comparedâ€™. It ends with the following conclusion: Men are subject to massive gender discrimination in the criminal justice system. If male offenders were treated in the same way as female offenders, there would be only one-sixth of the number of men in prison. About 68,000 men would not be in prison if they were female, leaving a male prison population of only 13,000.

c. For men, prison patently isnâ€™t working as a deterrent. Conditions in many menâ€™s prisons are brutal. Itâ€™s been estimated that 72% of prisoners have at least two mental health issues, and prison has been described as â€˜long-term warehousing of the mentally illâ€™. Most prisoners have mental health issues â€“ as well as drug dependency, illiteracy, and innumeracy â€“ and prisonersâ€™ time could be used to address these issues, but it isnâ€™t. The coalition has cut spending on rehabilitation programmes. As testament to the ineffectiveness of prison, we need only look at re-offending rates. Of the male prisoners released from prison in 2003, almost a third returned to prison within a year, almost half within three years, and 59% within 10 years. The government needs to go beyond warehousing male criminals, and to invest a great deal more on rehabilitation. It should hold a public inquiry to explore why other countries have far lower re-offending rates than the UK, with a view to following their examples

d. In an age of equality, it is iniquitous that the justice system treats men far more harshly than women. The government should hold a public inquiry into the matter, with a view to ensuring that the justice system becomes gender-blind. Men and women convicted of the same crimes should be equally likely to face incarceration, and serve the same sentences.

**11. POLITICAL REPRESENTATION**

a. The government should create a new cabinet position, Minister for Men and Equalities, to represent the interests of men and boys. The office holder should be a man, and should have access to the same level of resources that are available to the Minister for Women and Equalities.

b. Jess Phillips (a Labour MP selected from an all-women shortlist) tried to block the application of Philip Davies (a Conservative MP) to hold the first debate on menâ€™s issues ever to be held in Parliament, on International Menâ€™s Day, November 19, 2015. Happily, the debate went ahead, anyway. Ms Phillips won a â€˜Toxic Feminist of the Monthâ€™ award in recognition of her attempt to block it.

**12. FATHERLESSNESS, ENCOURAGING STRONG FAMILIES**

Today, fatherhood is being systematically removed from society by governments of all political hues who espouse the Harman/Hewitt political doctrine, through the family courts in their decisions about child access after divorce, and through the widespread development of single parenting, usually single motherhood. Fatherhood is deemed unnecessary by the state, so taxpayers are subsidizing sperm banks for single women and lesbians. At the lower end of the social scale, women are choosing what has become known as â€˜bureaugamyâ€™ - marriage to the state. They are having children with no intention of being married, and seeking the support of the state as the surrogate father. Given that men collectively pay 72% of the income tax collected in the UK, women are effectively replacing men as partners, with men as taxpayers. Findings from a recent study suggest that children who experience parental separation are more likely to report psychological distress when they reach their 30s than those who grow up in an intact family. Furthermore, the findings indicate that this association does not diminish over time across generations.

Teenagers living without their biological fathers:

\- Are more likely to experience problems with sexual health- Are more likely to offend- Are more likely to smoke- Are more likely to drink alcohol- Are more likely to take drugs- Are more likely to play truant from school- Are more likely to leave school at 16

Young adults who grow up not living with their biological fathers:

\- Are less likely to attain qualifications- Are more likely to experience unemployment- Are more likely to have low incomes- Are more likely be on income support- Are more likely to offend and go to jail- Are more likely to suffer from long term emotional and psychological problems- Are more likely to have children outside marriage or outside any partnership

Proposals to restore healthy fatherhood:

a. Tax advantages for married people should be restored (or introduced in countries which never had them).

b. The state should stop subsidizing sperm banks for single women as this encourages fatherless families.

**13. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE**

a. Male victims are being denied support. Men are almost 4/5 of all domestic violence victims.

b. Intimate Partner Violence is not a gendered problem but a generational problem, women are as physically aggressive as men towards intimate partners, as evidenced for example by a 2013 study â€˜References Examining Assaults by Women on their Spouses or Male Partners: An updated annotated bibliographyâ€™.

c. Gender biased family services discriminate kids by working from the feminist perspective of seeing a woman who is vulnerable instead of a woman who is dangerous to her children.

d. Male victims (29%) are nearly twice as likely as female victims (17%) to not tell anyone about the partner abuse. Only 10% of male victims will tell the police (27% women), only 22% will tell a person in an official position (38% women) and only 10% (15% women) will tell a health professional.

e. Virtually all refuge places are allocated to women and children. Without reducing the support given to female victims of IPV, Local Authorities should make funding available, and other support, to groups supporting male victims, whether through the provision of helplines, refuge places, or in other appropriate ways that take account of menâ€™s needs in crises such as this. The amount of funding and support should reflect what is known about the proportion of victims of IPV who are men. Funding should include awareness raising initiatives to make men aware of the existence of support services.

f. The government should introduce mandatory IPV perpetrator courses â€“ for both male and female perpetrators.

**14. SEXUAL ABUSE**

a. Women are responsible for a substantial proportion of sexual offences, including sexual abuses of children. People struggle to recognize women as perpetrators of sexual and non-sexual violence, in spite of the weight of evidence showing them to be frequent perpetrators of both. This is because the public has become conditioned to viewing men as perpetrators, and women as victims.

b. Itâ€™s known from a major American survey that over 25% of sex offences are committed by women against men (with no male accomplices). We would therefore expect the male/female ratio of people charged with sex offences to be a little under 3:1. The real ration in the UK in year 2013 was 146:1.

c. A major public information initiative should be developed to educate men and children about the issue of sexual abuse carried out by women.

d. A public inquiry should be held to establish why women are so rarely held accountable for the sex offences they commit, with a view to holding them properly accountable in the future.

**15. PATERNITY FRAUDS**

a. Women possess considerable reproductive rights, but choose their responsibilities. They can abort unborn children, have their children adopted, or bring up the children themselves â€“ if theyâ€™re single mothers, largely at taxpayersâ€™ expense. In stark contrast, a man has no rights at any stage, but is expected to bear heavy financial responsibility for his children, even when his partner has chosen to become pregnant without his express consent. A manâ€™s consent to sex is not the same as his consent to fatherhood.

b. Paternity fraud is an egregious assault on menâ€™s human rights â€“ it is fraud. It is also a cruel assault on the children who are born into this arrangement, whether or not they later learn who their true fathers are. William Collins has written impressive articles on paternity fraud, touching on the iniquity of DNA paternity tests having no legal validity unless the mother agrees to the tests being carried out - which must change.

c. Paternity fraud is such a grave assault upon the human rights of men and children that attempted (but failed) paternity fraud should attract a minimum three month prison sentence. Where a woman has carried out a proven paternity fraud, her minimum prison term should be 12 months. Where the fraud has continued for more than three years, her prison term should be 12 months plus three months in prison for each year of fraud. Frauds relating to two or more children should attract consecutive, not concurrent, sentences.

**16. RIGHTS OF SUSPECTED SEXUAL OFFENDERS**

a. Menâ€™s lives can be ruined by false rape allegations. The menâ€™s accusers enjoy anonymity, while the men donâ€™t.

b. The government should introduce legislation to protect the anonymity of people suspected of having committed sexual offences, until and unless the individuals have been convicted of the offences.

c. The government should introduce a registry of people convicted of making false sexual offence allegations.

**17. DIVORCE**

a. In an age of equality and no-fault divorce, when women have had the same employment rights as men for many years, it cannot be fair or just that divorced people have a right to a share of assets owned by their ex-spouses before they married, nor a share of assets acquired after marriage, other than to the extent to which they personally contributed to the creation or purchase of those assets.

**18. EXPECTATION OF RETIREMENT YEARS**

a. The government should set the ages at which men and women are entitled to receive the state pension, at levels which ensure that (on average) men and woman can expect to draw their state pension for the same number of years.

**19. ABORTION**

Elective abortions are permissible in Britain up to 24 weeks after conception, yet medical teams are fighting to save the lives of foetuses of around that age, and increasingly they are succeeding. Conversely, there are medical teams at work in the same hospitals killing foetuses of the same age, prior to extracting their dead bodies from their mothersâ€™ wombs. We find this morally indefensible. There comes a point at which the basic right to life of an unborn child overrides the right of a woman over her body. One personâ€™s rights end where another personâ€™s rights begin. In an age when contraception has long been readily available and highly reliable, women should be held morally accountable for the children they conceive. J4MB believes thereâ€™s a point in pregnancy when society â€“ and the law â€“ needs to recognize the right of the unborn child to life. Thereâ€™s no evidence to support the thesis that abortion reduces the risk to mental health of women with an unwanted pregnancy, and clinical trials to investigate the matter would, of course, be highly unethical. There is, however, some evidence to suggest that abortion itself increases the risk to mental health, so medical practitioners who authorize abortions on mental health risk grounds are doing so in the knowledge that thereâ€™s no body of research to support their authorizations.

Proposals:

a. Therefore, in the UK the Abortion Act (1967) should be amended to limit womenâ€™s right to have an abortion on the grounds of reducing the risk of injury to their mental health to a maximum of 13 weeks after conception. At this stage the gender of the embryo is unclear, so this would result in the end of gender-specific abortions, the incidence of which in the UK is a matter of some dispute.

b. The Abortion Act (1967) should remain unchanged with respect to womenâ€™s rights to have abortions carried out on the grounds of reducing the risk of injury to their physical health.

"So Iâ€™m in Peds, and today my Doc said something that caught me off guard.",561,8up0ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/8up0ac/so_im_in_peds_and_today_my_doc_said_something/,59,1530262588,"I work in a pediatrics office. The physician I was working with today, Dr. S, is a really nice, relaxed lady. Sheâ€™s a great person and I love working with her. She never bad mouths anyone, loves her patients and is just really nice to work with in general.


Anyway, today we had a 15 y/o female come in for her well check. She was (over) due for her second Hep A & second HPV. She got them both first in 2016. As I was leaving the room after getting her ready, Dr. S came in and was talking to Mom about what vaccines sheâ€™s due for. She told her what she needs and mom said â€œwell, we wonâ€™t be getting them because she hates needles.â€ Dr. S reply was â€œwell if she hates needles, sheâ€™s going to *really* hate the treatment for HPV.â€ 

My mouth dropped. I was totally not expecting that but was so proud. I never expected her to say anything like that, but Iâ€™m so proud she did! Mom just replied with â€œ....ok.â€ Needless to say, she ended up getting the vaccines. "
HPV disclosure - open discussion,21,9k1yr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/9k1yr0/hpv_disclosure_open_discussion/,3,1538296334,"As you know HPV can be cleared by the immune system or become not detectable. CDC says ""More than 90% of new HPV infections, including those caused by high-risk HPV types, clear or become undetectable within 2 years, and clearance usually occurs in the first 6 months after infection."".

It means that:

* some people clear HPV infection
* some people have persistent HPV infection
* some people have latent / dormant HPV infection

If you have persistent infection (high risk HPV on HPV PCR tests OR genital warts recurring for long time) then it's simple: YOU SHOULD DISCLOSE. Active infection = high viral load = it means that you are contagious. Of course lots of people don't know about their HPV infection but it doesn't mean that you should spread HPV. No one wants this shit.

In case of genital warts remember about recurrences. As CDC says:

> Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%), whether clearance occurs spontaneously or following treatment

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html

so again: disclose. But later (after a few months) it's getting more complicated:

Immune system can 100% remove the virus OR the virus can stay in latency. How many people will have latent / dormant infection? It's really hard to say. There are no 100% bulletproof numbers. But we can suppose that...

> A key uncertainty in the natural history of HPV infection within an individual is whether an HPV infection that becomes undetectable on repeat testing has truly cleared, or whether the virus persists at low, undetectable levels or has entered a latent state. While distinctions between the latter two scenarios are controversial, studies suggest that re-detection of the same HPV type is relatively common, occurring in at least 10â€“20% of women observed to have â€œclearedâ€ the virus

https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/9/10/267/htm

And now - this re-detection of the same HPV strain can be caused by reinfection with the same strain OR reactivation of the latent infection. Latent infections are not contagious (because virus is hiding from the immune system) however they can be reactivated by i.e. pregnancy / ageing / weaker immune system / mechanical wounds (animal studies) / UV light (animal studies). 

**What doctors say about disclosing HPV?**

First opinion:

> Given the ubiquitous nature of HPV infection, unless her partner is a virgin, the odds are pretty darned high that he already has had HPV. He may actually have the infection right now and be the one who gave it to her. On the other hand, he may have had it in the past and already be immune to the strain of HPV she has. Or be infected with another strain she does not have, so that she may actually be the one taking the risk by sleeping with him.

> There is no role for partner notification and  treatment in preventing the spread of HPV. The only thing that partner notification accomplishes is to turn women with abnormal paps into pariahs, while the rest of the HPV infected men and women out there continue to copulate in blissful ignorance.

> I do think itâ€™s worth discussing with your current partner if you discover that you have genital warts.More often that youâ€™d think, the male partner may have  small, previously undetected genital warts that are amenable to treatment. He can visit his doc for a careful exam and get treated if warts are present. That in turn may help you clear the infection faster yourself, since your immune system wonâ€™t be under constant barrage with high viral loads from your partner.

> The good news for HPV-infected women is that almost all HPV infections will clear. Once HPV is gone, your increased risk for cervical cancer goes with it. As does your risk for transmitting the virus to others. Which takes care of the issue of future partners.

http://www.tbtam.com/2012/01/must-tell-your-partners-that-have-hpv-doc-says-no.html

Second opinion:

> ""If you know you are HPV positive [with a low-risk strain not known to commonly cause cancer], I donâ€™t feel you have to disclose that to your partner,"" Jacques Moritz, ob/gyn at Weill Cornell Medicine and NewYork-Presbyterian, tells SELF, noting that even though safe-sex barriers like condoms and dental dams don't fully prevent HPV transmission, you should still use them. Moritz isn't adamant about people needing to disclose those forms of HPV because they're so common and usually not a risk to your health. ""Any man or woman should assume their partner has HPV because itâ€™s that ubiquitous,"" he explains. So ubiquitous, in fact, that doctors don't routinely test for HPV during Pap smears when a woman is under 30, he adds. But there are still reasons it can be a good idea to tell your partner.

Third opinion:

> Many of the 150 viruses that fall under the HPV umbrella won't harm you at all, and you'll never know you had one because they often clear from your system all on their own, board-certified ob/gyn Antonio Pizarro, M.D., tells SELF. â€œItâ€™s not a badge of shame,â€ Pizarro says, so telling someone usually doesnâ€™t need to be a huge production. â€œI would just bring it up as saying youâ€™ve tested positive for HPV, itâ€™s super common, and a lot of people have it,"" he says.

https://www.self.com/story/telling-partners-about-hpv

Fourth opinion:

> â€œHPV is extraordinarily common and is the most common sexually transmitted disease. Almost every sexually active person gets exposed to at least one, if not several, of the 15 carcinogenic viruses,â€ said Mark Schiffman, MD, head of the HPV unit at the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).

> â€œIf youâ€™ve got HIV, youâ€™ve got HIV, but if youâ€™ve got HPV, youâ€™re about to not have HPV,â€ Schiffman said. â€œNine out of 10 times you donâ€™t have it in two years. Maybe your body suppresses it like chickenpox, maybe it is completely gone, but the result is that you are OK.â€

> â€œIf you look at the curve, what it shows is that if you wait six months, youâ€™ve gotten rid of half your worry,â€ Schiffman said.

https://www.healio.com/infectious-disease/stds/news/print/infectious-disease-news/%7Baf692634-fd8f-4598-926d-1847b0ea5e5f%7D/many-hpv-infections-may-clear-quickly-without-treatment

Fifth opinion (from 2009):

> What can be said with certainty is that the most sensitive tests available--tests that detect HPV DNA in genital tissues--become negative within 6-12 months in over 90% of infected persons. We also know that once the test becomes negative, the person is immune to catching the same HPV type again, which is further evidenced that the infection was truly eradicated by the immune system. However, it remains possible that HPV DNA (or maybe even intact virus particles) persists in small amounts, too small for detection by the available tests. Whether this happens at all, or in what proportion of infected persons, cannot be known with certainty with available technology. But if infection persists, it almost certainly is in amounts to small to be transmitted to another person and probably will never re-grow to cause warts or precancerous growth. But in most persons the most infections are controlled by the immune system and most experts believe they are truly cured. For ""quick and dirty"" responses by clinicians like me, the evidence is good enough to say ""cure"" and to reassure our patients accordingly. 

> My practical take-home message is that after several months with no wart recurrence, normal pap, the person can consider him/herself cured; this is practically true if not always biologically true. Such persons probably transmit HPV to future partners rarely, if ever. Accordingly, I do not consider it ethically mandatory, or even recommended, that every person who ever has had HPV must henceforth and forever tell future partners they once were infected. My personal judgment is that you should inform partners in the next 3-4 months after your warts have disappeared, but if after then you have had no recurrences, you can safely assume your immune system has cleared the HPV infection and no longer need inform partners. 

>  For a new partner, you probably can start having sex as soon as the warts clear up. That soon, you SHOULD tell your partner, because there is still some chance of transmission. If s/he is aware of the low risk of an adverse outcome and feels OK with proceeding, don't let HPV stand in your way. If it has been longer than 6 months, I don't think you need say anything. Some people would endorse 3 months, 4 months, or a year; the science doesn't allow any more precision than this. I say 6 months.

Sixth opinion, from /r/Virology /u/CJay07

> I studied HPV for my PhD work, and the statement that ""HPV is with you for life"" isn't accurate. Most sexually active individuals are infected with HPV at one point during their lifetime. Epidemiological estimates range from 60-80% by the time you reach your forties. However, most infections are cleared by the immune system within a few months. A small subset of those individuals that do not clear the virus maintain a persistent infection (~1-2 years), but even those infections get cleared. An even smaller set of people go on to cancer. By that time however, the virus is generally long gone. One common situation in HPV-associated cancer is where the viral genome accidentally becomes a part of the host chromosome and the oncogenic (tumor promoting) elements of the virus become constitutively expressed. Those elements lead to rapid cell growth, among other things. Despite a little bit of the viral genome present at this stage, no viral particles can (or will be) produced.

> HPV infects basal epithelial stem cells, which are self renewing and give rise to the rest of the skin architecture. Here, the virus is maintained as an episome (viral DNA tethered to the host chromosome). There are no in tact virus particles here. Just viral DNA. It takes about three weeks for daughter cells (cells produced from the epithelial stem cells) to reach the surface, and it is not until during the final stages of cellular differentiation (cells becoming keratinized, stratifying, forming the uppermost layers of the skin) that you actually get the production of infectious virus particles. The virus coat (capsid), which envelops and protects the viral DNA, is produced very late during skin differentiation. This is a very fancy mechanism for immune evasion if you think about it. The superficial layers of the skin are not routinely surveyed by the immune system (because these cells are going to die), so by the time HPV expresses its most immunogenic products (the capsid proteins), immune cells are rarely to be found. This is one thought for how HPV can persist for so long (months to years), although the virus has many other ""tricks"" up its sleeve to hide from the immune system. With all that being said, when I say ""virus is cleared"", I mean the viral DNA is gone from its reservoir cell (the epithelial stem cell). Once that is gone, you don't have new viral particles being produced, and those particles that are hanging out on/in the skin will be lost during the natural turnover of the skin. This process wouldn't take long. It's more on the order of weeks, rather than years.

Q: Are there any studies about HPV disclosure?

A: Of course yes.

> This study provides the first data on the correlates and outcomes of male-to-female disclosure of HR-HPV infection. Disclosure did not lead to a perceived worsening relationship, and as disclosers were more likely to discuss the Pap test/HPV vaccine with their partners than non-disclosers, disclosure might be associated with public health benefits that derive from discussions about preventing HPV infections and cervical cancer.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398400/

When I had a hard time with HPV I got lots of positive feedback from /r/UpperLeftyOne [RIP] so that's what she once wrote:

> HPV isn't a forever infection like herpes. Eventually, you can say with certainty, that you are clear of the infection. The problem lies is knowing when this is true. (...) So the longer you are free from physical signs of warts, the safer it is to say that you've cleared the infection. The problem is that you can't see very well. I would absolutely disclose until you've had another pelvic exam and/or Pap smear to verify that there are no more warts. It is not uncommon to have to treat warts more than once before the virus is cleared.

And how about you? What is your opinion? Do you know any other useful quotes / evidence? 

In my opinion it's important to:

* do everything to clear the infection
* keep the healthy lifestyle (no smoking / no drugs / no heavy drinking)
* vaccinate yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9
* use condoms (you can still get Herpes and other stuff, right?)
* in case of serious relationships: vaccinate sexual partners 

And what CDC says about disclosure?

> the value of disclosing a past diagnosis of genital HPV infection to future partners is unclear, although candid discussions about past STDs should be supported whenever possible.

I recently got told I have HPV & recently noticed that my tonsils are enlarged. When I went to the dentist not too long ago, they noted that my tonsils were pretty big. Lately I notice that I can feel them in my throat when I lay down. The HPV is very new and I was wondering what I should do. Would this be a cause to get my tonsils removed? I just want to make sure this issue doesn't get worse. I have already started getting the HPV vaccine but am still very frightened for what this could develop into."
Doctor recommended that I get a colposcopy - is it really necessary?,1,9qlw4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/9qlw4h/doctor_recommended_that_i_get_a_colposcopy_is_it/,1,1540300740,"Info about me: 22 years old, female, 5 ft 10 in, 165 pounds, mixed race (Asian and white), this happened a few weeks ago, in California, concerns my cervix, no other medical issues, no medications other than birth control.

I got my first Pap smear ever a few weeks ago with a new doctor and she called me and said some of my cells were abnormal and that I should get a colposcopy so they could get more information. When I asked if I should be worried, she just said they needed more information. She also said that since Iâ€™m so young, a lot of abnormalities will go away on their own, but that I should get checked every 6 months for a while to make sure... This really seems like overkill to me for something that may just go away. Should I even get a colposcopy? I have the HPV vaccine, donâ€™t have unprotected sex, I feel fine, my periods are normal, Iâ€™m young and Iâ€™m healthy in every other way. Iâ€™ve never had a health issue before and Iâ€™m kind of scared and I just want to ignore this but I feel like thatâ€™s a dumb thing to do. Is this serious?

The big issue is that I donâ€™t want to pay for a colposcopy - I have health insurance through my job but I may have to pay up to $2000 for this procedure myself. I tried to get an estimate for this procedure but it is so difficult to get ahold of anyone who knows anything on the phone so I have no idea what it would cost. Is it possible this was some kind of false positive? What should I do? Save up for a colposcopy or get another Pap smear with a different doctor? What are my options? Thanks in advance for any advice!"

No option to add categories like viscosity, motility, volume, survival after defrosting. As a male I have had to endure great trouble finding information on the whole medical branch called Andrology. I want to be informed on testicular torsion, variocele, spermatocele, urinary travt infection. No one told me I had to pee after ejaculating to clean the pipes. No one told me that matas â€œintimsÃ¦beâ€( english: intimate soap) was for women only and that the low ph was for vaginas. No one especially not my dad told me to wear protective gear for the crotch during soccer practice. I have uniquely by my own money and volition stored my own semen, as backup and insurance, and am aware that the anove mentioned categories matter. I tried downloading Trak as a substitute. I canâ€™t get myself to use it. And it bothers me endlessly that apples feminist bullies has neglected 50% of the population and called it â€œreproductive healthâ€. Have my marketing data. Sure. But donâ€™t be feminist pieces of shit. Its bad enough that here in Denmark women are overwheingly overrepresented in anything related to health. At the bachelors in health economics, and at hospital laborants, its 100-99% female. Donâ€™t you fucking make this health app another tool at their disposal to eradicate men and males from the health sector. 

And where was the notification on my phone that told me HPV vaccine was now free for males in Denmark? After havig been historically unequally free for women only. And to top it off, its only free because a lot of women did not make use of the free vaccine.

What I wrote here could be diminished into some form of â€œnavy seal copypastaâ€. But the issie is serious enough. Make no mistake. 

If your balls suddeny start to hurt and, you realize that the andrology sector doesnâ€™t exist in your eyes might open.  And no, urology is not andrology. If you havenâ€™t noticed these are two different areas of the body.

Your son complains about pain in the neatger regions and you brush it off as a sore hip. Three hours later, your son is now sterile and has to be in the hospital for a week, waiting for the specialist to arrive. 

Not being informed on reproductive health is serious.  And if you care, upvite this. Nor because of karma, bur because I know a lot of arrogant people donâ€™t give a damn about this and will downvote it. Not even talking about the twoxâ€™ers here."

Might have caught an STI,1,96h9b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/96h9b7/might_have_caught_an_sti/,6,1534029392,"Well, this is embarrassing. Throwaway, for obvious reasons.

**Female, 22, 173 cm, 63 kg. Medication: Microgynon 30 (birth control).**

So a previous sexual partner got in touch to tell me he has been tested positive for Condyloma. Great.

We have had unprotected sex, over a year and a half ago, after he told me (and apparently lied) that he was recently tested negative for anything they bother to check. I was tested and was found negative, prior to the sexual encounters. I have not had sex with anyone since.

I haven't noticed any symptoms at all, but I've googled it, and from what I can tell lot of people are symptom-less carriers of HPV, or that the symptoms are often negligent enough to be waved off as something else.

I've had the Gardasil vaccine long before I met him.

I've set an appointment with my GP tomorrow, and will be calling my OBGYN as well and see what he tells me to do. I'll ask the GP for blood tests (can you check for HPV in a blood test?), and we'll go from there.

So the questions are:

- Could I be infected?
- If I am, am I infectious, even while symptom-less?
- What treatment options are available if I am infected, and symptom-less?
- Have I missed anything? Should I do something I haven't already?"

It is only on my left forearm and I have no idea what could have caused this to happen, it seems pretty random (but I'm guessing something irritated my skin there). This has flared up in the past before, one of the times being after I got a vaccine (don't remember which one though, I think it was the HPV one). Earlier today they weren't quite as raised, they were much smaller and looked a little more red but that's about it.

Treating common wart,1,974wan,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/974wan/treating_common_wart/,0,1534245188,"Greetings r/medical!

33 y/o male, treatment: 4 days, doesn't itch, but maybe ascending pathology/soreness?

I'm concerned with the treatment of a wart on my left thumb. I'm treating it with OTC liquid salicylic acid. It formed on a crease in my thumb so I think I may be treating the roots as well. I remember treating this similarly when I was young, somewhere between 9-11y. 

My concern is that I feel tingling/soreness in my wrist as well as ascending dark red discoloration that I just noticed tonight. I know warts are viral. Do I need to worry about infection or letting the virus into my blood stream? I was already 25 when hpv vaccine was only indicated for females. So advice welcome.

DAE parents have boundary issues with nudity? TW sexual abuse maybe?,20,8liwum,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/8liwum/dae_parents_have_boundary_issues_with_nudity_tw/,10,1527106945,"New to this forum, have been reading through the posts for hours and Iâ€™m finding so many similarities between my Nmum and other peopleâ€™s parents. Itâ€™s like they are all cut from the same cloth.

Through reading through the posts I have just realised, at the age of 24, that itâ€™s not normal for my mother to be constantly getting naked around me (Iâ€™m female btw) I could write a novel about the messed up behaviour of this woman but Iâ€™m wondering if anyone elseâ€™s mums behave like this, and what you did to stop it? Iâ€™ve tried telling her it makes me uncomfortable, but that seems to make her enjoy it more. Some highlights include:
 
kindergarten age, at the library with her, she leaves me alone in the kids section, I take a book and go sit in the general reading area about 5 meters away from a random old guy. She sees me and comes over and loudly tells me that â€˜this perv wants to f*** me.â€™
 
age 11 or 12, $20 or so goes missing from her purse, she blames me. (I did not take it) she is hysterical, drags me outside to the corner in my tiny pyjamas and tells me to stand there and prostitute myself to pay her back.

Primary school age, the school is doing free hpv vaccines, I ask if I can get it (I barley knew what it was, I was just terrified of getting sick) and she demands to know why I want it, and how would I get hpv in the first place? (Implying that I want to have sex)

 age 12, Christmas Day. Loudly exclaims in front of my entire extended family â€˜look! Gavvn, your pubes are hanging out!â€™ (They werenâ€™t, this was apparently a joke.) I was mortified. I think everyone else in the room was just as uncomfortable
 
ongoing until age 16 when I left home. There is no lock on the bathroom door, pretty much anytime Iâ€™m in the shower she will find an excuse to bust open to door. No locks on the bedroom door either and she has never once knocked.

 high school age, maybe 14, a boy in my art class asked me to mind his watch while he did something with clay, he forgot to take it back off me and I took it home with me by accident. She finds a mans watch in my bedroom and publicly accused me of â€˜f***ing grown men in my roomâ€™ (because she didnâ€™t think a high school boy would own a watch) 

ongoing, whenever she comes to visit she will always sleep naked with the bedroom door open while my husband is home, she will even walk to the bathroom naked.
 
this year, walk past an adult store with costumes in the front window. In front of male relatives she starts mocking me and asks if thatâ€™s what I wear for my husband.
 
also this year, announce my second pregnancy to everyone at once over a family group chat. Everyone says congratulations, she instead makes a comment about me tearing my vagina. Again in front of male relatives, young and old.

Why do some Nparents do this stuff?? Is it a sexual thing? A power thing? Just a serious lack of boundaries? Do they think this is normal or do they know itâ€™s insane? This is just a short list of many weird sexual behaviours and comments. I want this to stop! It makes me feels so dirty and ashamed and uncomfortable

Vaccination Opinions,0,8p1gnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/8p1gnn/vaccination_opinions/,20,1528327170,"Hello,

I'm looking for some female advice about the Gardasil/HPV vaccination, not sure if this is the right sub. I'm currently a 20f in college and have received none of the vaccines in this series. My mother decided against it when I was young, but now that I'm older I'm interested in getting it (partially due to my doctors recommendation) and want to be well informed. So my questions are basically: has anyone had any serious health problems after this vaccine? (I know correlation doesnt mean causation when it comes to data such as this) What are some good resources for info related to this that I can show to my mom so we can discuss why it is important? 

Thanks for reading, and have a lovely day women of reddit!"
Study shows 40 Percent Lower Fertility Rate among women 25-29 in USA,4,8wu20p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/8wu20p/study_shows_40_percent_lower_fertility_rate_among/,1,1531007193,"I realize this is not directly MGTOW material - but if any part of this is true it is going to have massive effects going forward on a lot of different social and economic issues.

And no, I will not be pulled into another vax-novax debate.   All I am concerned with is the follow-on effects.

 **ABSTRACT**

Birth rates in the United States have recently fallen. Birth rates per 1000 females aged 25â€“29 fell from 118 in 2007 to 105 in 2015. One factor may involve the vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV). Shortly after the vaccine was licensed, several reports of recipients experiencing primary ovarian failure emerged. This study analyzed information gathered in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which represented 8 million 25-to-29-year-old women residing in the United States between 2007 and 2014. **Approximately 60\% of women who did not receive the HPV vaccine had been pregnant at least once, whereas only 35\% of women who were exposed to the vaccine had conceived. For married women, 75\% who did not receive the shot were found to conceive, while only 50\% who received the vaccine had ever been pregnant.** Using logistic regression to analyze the data, the probability of having been pregnant was estimated for females who received an HPV vaccine compared with females who did not receive the shot. Results suggest that females who received the HPV shot were less likely to have ever been pregnant than women in the same age group who did not receive the shot. If 100&#37; of females in this study had received the HPV vaccine, data suggest the number of women having ever conceived would have fallen by 2 million. Further study into the influence of HPV vaccine on fertility is thus warranted."
[29M] dating [32F] for >2 months. Scared about how to bring up high risk HPV exposure,2,8lfl6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/8lfl6u/29m_dating_32f_for_2_months_scared_about_how_to/,4,1527068980,"Hi all,

(Before anyone asks: we haven't had sex yet nor done anything that would expose her lady parts to this virus)

I'm a guy posting here because I'd love some female perspective on my situation. Long story short, been seeing a woman for a bit over 2 months now and I must say it's the first time in a long while for both of us that we've been seriously interested in someone. Everything is going great so far: we're communicating well, extraordinary chemistry, love each other's company, etc. And we're taking things pretty slow physically, long make out sessions and some heavy petting, though nothing past ""first base."" This is unusual for me, but I'm cool with it because again, I really like her. In fact, I'm totally falling in love with her...hence why I'm a bit freaked out about this. It's actually exhilarating and refreshing to be getting to know her as a person before diving into things too deep physically.

As the title would imply, the problem I have is that I know for a fact I've been exposed recently to some high risk strain of HPV. Last fall I went through a phase where I was starting my new job and not really looking for a relationship so I was messing around on dating apps. Ended up meeting a girl that became a good friend of mine, but with whom we both realized we weren't going to form a serious relationship.

We had sex off and on for months starting around September and ending in early March. Before we had sex, she informed me she had an abnormal pap result that indicated a high risk strain of HPV. I'm not super squeamish and after talking it over with a friend, I decided that she was someone I wasn't just going to have a one night stand with and decided to go ahead. I used protection and also found out I could still get the HPV vaccine (even though I was 29) shortly after we started engaging physically. So I got the vaccine, all three doses, finishing up in March. For a while, we weren't using protection either, and generally not being super careful.

As a guy, there's no way I can know whether or not I contracted the virus from her or whether the vaccine kicked in and killed it. And, for all I know, given previous behaviors I could have had it already and been none the wiser. My current girlfriend could frankly have it as well, as in her 20's she's told me she went through a period where she slept with a bunch of guys she met at bars (she's 32 now). Odds are good some of them passed HPV onto her. I saw a recent NIH study that found 65% of men in their population had HPVâ€”men who had never had a history of HPV or any STD....so it's super common.

So chances are we've both been exposed. But I'm freaked out about discussing it with her because she seems a bit finnicky about germs now. I'm terrified that this will torpedo our relationship. Many people I talk to think this is not a realistic fear, given how common HPV is, how manageable it is in a developed country, and the fact that I'm looking for a serious relationship with her -- not just to be friends with benefits. It's easy enough to say to someone else ""if that's going to end the relationship, it wasn't going to work anyway"" but it's hard when I'm the one involved.

I'd love to have sex with her, but I really care about this woman and I'm even willing to pay for her to get the Gardasil 9 vaccine (the one I got) out of pocket and wait several months to do so if she wants. Or just delay having sex until she's more comfortable with our compatibility.

Going through a lot of emotions over this lately...going back and forth between feeling like I screwed up and was reckless and should've thought ahead more sleeping with my other friend. Though I frankly don't really regret it (maybe the not using protection bit) as we really enjoyed each other's company and had a good relationship for what it was. And I know she feels the same......but I'm worried now that it's going to come back to haunt me. Part of me really wants to kick myself. I've played various conversations out in my head 1000 times and am just stressed about it.

Any experience about how to approach this? How might I approach this? I feel that now that we've been together longer than 2 months and things are starting to get heavier it's time to bring it up. Especially if she decides she wants to get the vaccine. I really care about her and have a feeling this relationship could go somewhere...

Thank you!! Appreciate any support and/or input anyone can provide :)

TL;DR; Dating a girl I really like right now for > 2 months. Things are going great and we're both super into each other. We haven't had sex, but before we do I need to tell her that a recent, previous partner of mine had a high risk strain of HPV. Got vaccine last fall, but it may not have kicked in time to protect me from the strain previous partner had. Wondering how to approach this without torpedoing relationship. Scared."
"I was exposed to HPV strain 1, 2 and/or 4 in between doses of Gardasil and I know have genital warts, was the vaccine completely ineffective?",1,8l4xd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8l4xd6/i_was_exposed_to_hpv_strain_1_2_andor_4_in/,4,1526970901,"Hello, I am a female and got the Gardasil vaccine in middle school but I also developed a Plantar wart on my foot at age 12, this was in between or prior to doses of Gardasil. I took 2 doses total as I was <15. 

I remember thinking, ""Don't I already have it, though?"" but because I was a kid I just shrugged. I recently developed genital warts and went for treatment, and the doctors reassured me that the strains that cause genital warts do NOT cause cervical cancer. However, if I know I've already contracted more than one strain, doesn't that point to the vaccine having been completely ineffective? 

I have a copper IUD so no hormonal birth control, I haven't taken hormonal birth control since 16, I quit smoking last year and I have not yet had kids - that's my biggest concern, preserving my fertility. 

I am almost 22 years old, I also have PCOS if that matters. I am 5'5 and 140 lbs, my BMI is something around 22-23. I have never been clinically overweight but plan to lower my BMI to around 20. I got a PAP smear last week and will be talking to my doctor about getting them more frequently. 


My theory is that because I already had HPV either prior to the vaccine or in between doses it wasn't effective at all. I have had sex with someone (protected) who has had sex with a woman who had HPV and cervical cancer. I'm worried that since I know I have 2 types of strains I likely have contracted the cancer one. 

Is this assumption likely to be true? "
What is the average clearance time for an HPV infection for someone in their mid 20s who is healthy?,2,8k4bnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/medical/comments/8k4bnj/what_is_the_average_clearance_time_for_an_hpv/,2,1526593203,"Hi!  Found out a few weeks ago I have a strain of high risk HPV,  but it's not type 16 or 18 (had Gardasil Vaccine in 2011).   Any idea on the clearance time of the infection?  I hear 6 mos-2 years, but was wondering if 6 months is more the norm as opposed to longer than that? 

Also, does anyone know if certain vitamins or supplements do truly help aid in the clearance of HPV?  Like Folic acid, Echinacea, etc.  I know limiting stress, getting enough sleep, and eating properly are probably the most important. 
 (Ps. I am aware HPV is a virus, but as a cold is a virus that clears, most cases of HPV do as well).

Injection site swelling from HPV vaccine getting worse. Is this normal or do I need to follow up?,2,8j9cqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/8j9cqg/injection_site_swelling_from_hpv_vaccine_getting/,2,1526297879,"Age: 26,

I got the HPV-9 vaccine 3 days ago, and the swelling seems to have gotten worse between yesterday and today. It is now approximately 1.5-2"" in diameter, and also raised by about 1mm. The area is really hot/warm, has gotten more red, and hurts a lot (not excruciating, but definitely more painful than my other HPV shots). The reaction is still localized, and I haven't noticed any systemic side effects. Not sure if I have a fever, but I can still think clearly so probably not. Is this still normal, or do I need to follow up with my primary care physician tomorrow? I'm really scared because this has never happened to me before, and I don't know if this is really serious and worsening, or if I'm just overreacting.

"Found warts, had cryotherapy... Now what?",7,8i0ncp,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/8i0ncp/found_warts_had_cryotherapy_now_what/,1,1525845020,"A bit of back story, I am a female aged 21. I started having sex with multiple partners around August of last year. Until that point I had only been with one other person. In March of this year I figured it was time for an STD check, it came back negative. I understand that I wasn't tested for HPV at this time so it could have been passed to me by any of them- there were a couple instances where I hadn't used condoms all in the months of 2018. At the end of April I noticed I had bumps on my anus and went to go get an STD checked. I went to a free clinic where the lady said they were genital warts right away. I did my first session of cryotherapy that day. Then, I was told to keep an eye to see if I needed a second treatment. I had an appointment for two weeks later and in this time I abstained from all sexual intercourse. At my second appointment the same lady told me it had healed very well and that there was only one visible wart and one tiny one left to freeze off. I did that and went on my way. 

Now where I'm unsure is what I'm supposed to do next. I have been doing a bunch of research on HPV, but theres so much information out there and none that really cater towards... What do I do after cryotherapy? Should I be scheduling a pap smear? I understand that the virus exists inside me and that warts could appear again, but is there any other procedure I should be doing? It seems too easy. I learned that I should be boosting my immune, etc. I got a multivitamin and immunity booster... Anything else? I'm wondering now though:

How would one know they're free of HPV? Is it just after the 6 months-2 years? Do I get some sort of test? Will the pap smear detect this? What about the vaccine? Do I get it now? Would I book the pap, let them know of the genital warts then have them tell me what kind of HPV it is? It's all pretty confusing to me and I don't know of anyone who has gone through a similar thing. I hope someone can offer some guidance.

The Case for Male Circumcision,0,7yf5jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/7yf5jh/the_case_for_male_circumcision/,28,1518999016,"one thing that unites anti-Semites of the left-wing and right-wing variety is dislike of circumcising men. I am in favor of circumcision for two massive reasons:

**I**

The [benefits WAYYYY outweigh the bogus ""concerns"" about it](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1758146/)

>There is substantial evidence that circumcision protects males from HIV infection, penile carcinoma, urinary tract infections, and ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases. We could find little scientific evidence of adverse effects on sexual, psychological, or emotional health. Surgical risks associated with circumcision, particularly bleeding, penile injury, and local infection, as well as the consequences of the pain experienced with neonatal circumcision, are valid concerns that require appropriate responses.

[More](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3684945/)

>There were no significant differences in male sexual satisfaction or dysfunction among trial participants, and in one trial, circumcised men reported increased penile sensitivity and enhanced ease of reaching orgasm.9 In addition, 97% of female partners reported either no change or improved sexual satisfaction after their male partner was circumcised...The evidence for the long-term public health benefits of male circumcision has increased substantially during the past 5 years. If a vaccine were available that reduced HIV risk by 60%, genital herpes risk by 30%, and HR-HPV risk by 35%, the medical community would rally behind the immunization and it would be promoted as a game-changing public health intervention. Based on the medical evidence, banning infant male circumcision would deprive parents of the right to act on behalf of their childrenâ€™s health.


**II** 

It being widespread in America, the only Christian majority country in which a majority of all men are circumcised, normalizes a Jewish tradition/practice. That is has been so widespread is indicative that Jewish ideas are accepted and embraced here, unlike in Europe. The continuation of this trend will further ensure the relative Jewish acceptance we have here that we don't elsewhere in the diaspora.

ENOUGH SAID. Anyone who, given the proven health benefits demonstrated by the best and most reputable sources, questions them, is basically an anti-Semite. The only alternative explanation they're left with is ""da Jooz control medicine."" (And for Jews who oppose, its just ignorance of naivete of the true motives behind those who argue against it)"

When reading up on the vaccine a bit, I am seeing a lot of people claiming the vaccine gave them HPV/abnormal PAP results, genital warts, or even outbreaks of warts on the hands, feet, or face.

I'm confused about this because what I read claims Gardisil has either deactivated virus, or just a protein similar to one found in the HPV virus (It's actually unclear to me which description is correct since those seem like different things), so it doesn't seem logical that an uninfected person could get HPV from the shot.

Chemically Castrated Gender Bending Pesticides. Are Gays Naturally Born that Way?,0,7c7zm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/adventism/comments/7c7zm0/chemically_castrated_gender_bending_pesticides/,67,1510429669,"Edited to add [Born Gay? SDA ARTICLE](http://www.adventistsaffirm.org/article/80/previous-issues/volume-14-number-1/homosexuality-in-the-church-should-this-born-a-gay-lifestyle-be-baptized).
>Homosexuality in the Church: Should This ""Born-a-Gay"" Lifestyle Be Baptized?

by Samuel Koranteng-Pipim

>Why is homosexuality an Adventist ""hot potato""? Are there clear answers to the new interpretations of Scripture we are hearing?


All manner of sin can be forgiven, provided we admit our wrongdoing, repent, and turn away from it. But there can be no forgiveness when sinners are in denial--when they insist that their lustful desires and practices are not sinful, when they re-interpret Scripture to justify their sins, and when they defiantly maintain that they will not turn from their sinful ways.
Homosexuality Has Come to Church
Almost two decades ago, a former dean of the Theological Seminary at Andrews University perceptively noted: ""The gay crisis has come to church. Some homosexuals are coming to church not only for forgiveness and mercy but to say to the church, as they have to the world, `Homosexuality is not sinful; it is natural to me. God made me this way. He accepts me and my homosexuality as good. Therefore the time has come for the church to accept me as I am and join me in saying that gayness is good.'""1

The above statement aptly captures the essence of the ""born-a-gay gospel"" and its varied ""ministries"" or ""support groups.""2 Though advocates of this gospel employ the term ""ministry"" to describe their ""outreach"" to gay and lesbians, such ""ministries"" for the most part do not teach homosexuals to repent of their particular sin. Instead, they suggest that the church itself must be ""educated"" to own up to its ""immoral"" past, when it failed to ""understand"" and recognize homosexuality as a morally legitimate lifestyle. Regrettably, an increasing number of Christians are uncritically embracing this new ""gospel.""
The Changing Attitude Toward Homosexuality
Homosexuality is not a new sexual behavior that has suddenly burst upon our modern culture. The practice has been present in almost every human society. Not unexpectedly, the Bible also deals with the subject in such texts as Genesis 19 (cf. Jude 7; 2 Pet 2:6-10), Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13, Romans 1:24-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, and 1 Timothy 1:8-11. If there is anything new about the practice of homosexuality, it lies in the fact that contrary to the church's response in the past, many churches in our day are accepting homosexuality as a morally legitimate lifestyle.
Even in our own Seventh-day Adventist church the attitudes of some are changing on the issue of homosexuality.



>Even though we may easily dismiss the above examples of allegedly healthy gay and lesbian relationships in the Bible as frivolous inventions, not all the arguments of pro-gay theology can be rebuffed so handily. Some of the arguments are quite sophisticated, often invoking scientific, philosophical, or logical arguments to show that (i) people are born homosexual (i.e., homosexuality is genetic or inborn); (ii) the sexual orientation of people ""born gay"" should be viewed as a natural or normal trait of their identity, like the color of the skin, eyes, or hair, or as a God-given gift; (iii) a person's ""God-given"" homosexual orientation is morally neutral and unchangeable; and (iv) the Bible is silent, or does not condemn, homosexuality as such, but only its abuse.
Sincere, Bible-believing Christians are often caught off-guard by the subtle and plausible-sounding arguments in favor of homosexuality today. In an effort to clear away the smoke-screen which often clouds this issue, I will list some of the arguments in circulation, following each with a response which I hope will make clear the fundamental issue at stake for the Christian. I believe that the reader will find in Scripture a clear and consistent guide to God's will in this highly-charged matter.
Because of space limitations I can only summarize and respond to some of the major arguments put forth by those attempting to reconcile the ""born a gay"" ideology with the Bible's ""born again"" theology. Those seeking a fuller discussion and documentation on the subject should consult my forthcoming book, Must We Be Silent? 

[Chemically Castrated](http://news.berkeley.edu/2010/03/01/frogs/). Gender Bending Pesticides. Are Gays Naturally Born that Way?

Increasingly, Adventist must deal with homosexuality in the church. Are we prepared to deal with those that claim that they were born that way? New Research into pesticides chemicals and vaccinations, inform us that the enemy is purposefully sewing and destroying seeds.

With the increasing number [of gays as SDA's, the church, the church finds itself trying to clearly articulate it's position on homosexuality.](https://www.adventist.org/en/information/official-statements/statements/article/go/-/same-sex-unions/).

>Homosexuality is a manifestation of the disturbance and brokenness in human inclinations and relations caused by the entrance of sin into the world. While everyone is subject to fallen human nature, ""we also believe that by God's grace and through the encouragement of the community of faith, an individual may live in harmony with the principles of God's Word"" (Seventh-day Adventist Position Statement on Homosexuality, 2012). 4


[SEE HPV](http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/janak)


Homosexuals themselves try to use an emotional approach to a Biblical law. See this article entitled [Gays in the Family](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/3071156). 
>Just sitting in the pews as an LGBT person can be one of the most uncomfortable situations of our lives, as weâ€™re spoken about in a theoretical and theological fashion, but seldom are we actually asked or allowed to share our perspective.

This is a method that is used to try to confuse the law abiding Christian. But when we can answer that the seed itself is being corrupted we can see that the law of God does not change and that we must fight back against the altering of people at the DNA level.

As a church, when we see  that vaccines, pesticides, and chemicals can alter more than our mood, we must now [reexamine how those that were ""born that way,"" were actually ""born that way!""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3168220/).

Medications/conditions: None
Smoke: No
Drink: Occasional 
Medical issues: None that I'm aware of
Duration: 1.5-2 months

I noticed that within the past 1.5 months, I gained 5 pounds!! In late January, I was 109 pounds, and I decided to start a diet hoping to convert some of my fat into muscle. For about the first two weeks, I followed a low carb moderate protein diet and kept my calorie intake at 1200 with carbs every 3rd day. After that, I didn't follow through because the diet didn't include fruits (except 1/2 grapefruit), and also made me tired. On the third week, I changed my diet back to the way it was in January (I had more energy) before my diet, except that I had a grapefruit every morning, since I learned that it is a negative calorie food. This went on for about a month. I weighed myself last week, and I noticed that I was at 112 pounds! I stopped eating grapefruit, cut my calorie intake (hoping to lose the extra weight that I gained), but I ended up gaining another 2 pounds within just this one week! I even went to work out, and I still didn't lose any weight (I actually gained weight from working out). Did I completely mess up my metabolism by going on the low carb moderate protein diet, stopping mid-way, and then adding grapefruit to my regular diet, and then abruptly cutting it out? Please help! Is this typical due to dieting, or is there something else that I need to be concerned about? I'm still in my normal BMI, but I don't want to keep gaining weight at this rate!

P.S. The numbers are my weights when I wake up in the morning.

Carrageenan lube to inhibit HPV (and possibly HSV) transmission,21,77zts2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Swingers/comments/77zts2/carrageenan_lube_to_inhibit_hpv_and_possibly_hsv/,5,1508702551,"In my quest for safer sex practices, I ran across the information that carrageenan, a substance found in some lubes, is an inhibitor for HPV (and possibly HSV) transmission. A recent small-scale study showed promising results, reducing HPV transmission rates in human females with 50%-60%: 

https://thelinknewspaper.ca/article/can-algae-prevent-hpv

The authors plan a follow-up study where they combine using this lube with condoms, so my understanding is that the reduction was observed when not using condoms. Separate studies show condom use decreases the risk of transmission by around 70%. 

The potential of carrageenan is known for quite some years, this is a study from 2006: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16839203

Also, there are some studies (so far, on mice) that show the potential to inhibit the transmission of the herpes virus too: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC170551/

My suggestion is that we should consider using carrageenan lube when playing with others, for a possible increase in safety. Of course, this shouldn't replace the use of condoms or doing the anti-HPV vaccine (but keep in mind the vaccine only protects against a few strains).

I thought to share this here, maybe it prevents someone from catching something. Using the carrageenan lube shouldn't make you over-confident or take additional risks though, these are small scale studies (or not even performed on humans) and none show a 100% safety profile. But, if you're going to do something anyway, it seems like using a carrageenan-based lube MIGHT give you some added protection.

Take care! And let me know if you have any thoughts on this :)"

> Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%)

**Possible solutions:**

A. Check your glucose level and do HbA1c test. There is a correlation between GW recurrences and diabetes.

> Through clinical practice, it is often perceived that patients with diabetes are more likely to suffer from severe and recalcitrant warts. This study was set up to investigate if genital warts were more common in patients with diabetes and to determine if patients with diabetes and genital warts required more treatment than those without diabetes. Only female patients with diabetes and genital warts were investigated and were compared to the non-diabetic population. Results suggested that patients with diabetes had more extensive warts and recurrences. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20852193

B. Try antiviral herbs: Ellagic acid (i.e. from Pomegranate extract) and Annona Muricata extract. You can order EA+AM from iHerb.

> Ellagic acid (EA) and Annona Muricata (AM) have antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antiviral activity demonstrated by in vitro models. This pilot study investigated the in vivo potential anti-viral activity in women affected by Low squamous intraepithelial lesion (L-SIL) related to high risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV), and the ability to modify the oncoproteins expression in the cervical lesion thickness. Sixty women affected by HR-HPV related L-SIL, were randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 30) supplemented with EA (16 mg) + AM (100 mg) 2 times daily for 6 months and group B (n = 30) administered with placebo. HR-HPV clearance was obtained in 74% of cases in group A compared to 25% of cases in group B (p = 0.001) and p21 expression in LSIL thickness increased in 63.2% of cases in group A compared to 20% in group B (p = 0.03). AE/AM supplementation significantly induces HR-HPV elimination and stimulates p21 expression in LSIL thickness.

C. Try medicinal mushrooms: Coriolus Versicolor and Reishi. Only extracts are effective. Mushroom powders = placebo.

> This preliminary randomized study investigated the efficacy of medicinal mushrooms, Trametes versicolor (TV), Ganoderma lucidum (GL), and Laetiporus sulphureus (LS), on the clearance of oral human papillomavirus (HPV, serotypes 16 and 18). Among 472 patients who underwent oral swabs for gingivitis, 61 patients were positive for HPV16 or HPV18. Twenty patients were included in group 1 (LS) and 41 patients were included in group 2 (TV+GL) for 2 months. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV was performed at inclusion and after 2 months. In group 1, the clearance was equal to 5% after 2 months of treatment. In group 2, the clearance was equal to 88% (P<0.001). The detection of HPV16 or HPV18 could become relevant in routine since positivity is frequent and because a harmless and costless treatment may exist. The use of TV+GL for the clearance of oral HPV deserves further investigation.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25271984#

D. Combine Cryotherapy or Podophyllotoxin with Panavir, antiviral gel made in Russia. You can order Panavir from online pharmacies.

> The article presents the results of treatment of 51 men with recurrent genital HPV infection in the form of genital warts. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the treatment. Group 1 of patients has received the combination treatment--electrocoagulation + pharmacotherapy (panavir intravenously and topically in the form of a gel), Group 2 of patients--only electrocoagulation. According to the results of follow-up within 6 months, disease recurrence rate was significantly higher in Group 2--39.5% versus 9.6% in the Group 1. Postoperative complications were also more frequently recorded in the Group 2. These findings suggest that the combined treatment of reccurent forms of genital warts is preferred than just using destructive methods of treatment.

http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/24649765

> This research is devoted to determination of the clinical efficacy of Panavir in the combined therapy of the uterine cervix diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). The article presents data of the complex examination of 59 patients. Patients with diagnosed 16th, 18th, 31st, 33rd types of HPV underwent destructive methods of treatment of the cervix followed by Panavir. The efficacy of Panavir was estimated by PCR in 3, 6 and 12 months from the beginning of treatment and it was 84,7%. Antiviral therapy permits to prevent recurrence of papillomavirus infection of the cervix uteri.

E. Try Solanum incanum extract, SR-T100 gel.

> In this pilot study of condyloma treatment, 19 (73%) of 26 patients using the SR-T100 gel (2.3% solamargine in Solanum incanum plant extract) exhibited a response, and 16 (61.5%) patients achieved total clearance. In addition, only one patient showed a severe (grade 3-4) skin-related side effect. Although an extract of Solanum dulcamara L. has been reported in folk medicine to treat warts, this is the first reported trial of the use of solamargine to treat condyloma.

F. Combine Cryotherapy or Podophyllotoxin with Inosine Pranobex (3g daily, 14-28 days)

> This study evaluates the effectiveness of immunomodulating drug isoprinosine in a comprehensive treatment of genital warts in men. Most of the patients were aged 20-30 years. The combination therapy was found to have long term effectiveness. In the group of patients undergoing only destructive methods of treatment relapse after 8 month follow-up was diagnosed in 32% and in patients of the combination therapy group (destruction plus isoprinosine) - in 7% of patients. The pharmacological action of the drug (immunostimulating, antiviral) and the effectiveness of its combination with destructive therapies justify the use of inosine pranobex (isoprinosine) both in the complex therapy of genital warts and for the prevention of the disease recurrence.

G. Combine Imiquimod with Gardasil / Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine. Imiquimod / Aldara is not very effective in males, but it seems that Imiquimod + full vaccination is much more effective.

> The study comprised 36 patients, including 22 men, aged 26.4+/-4.1 years, who had from 1 to 5 anogenital warts. Participants of the study were vaccinated by quadrivalent recombinant vaccine under a 3-dose scheme 0-2-6 months co-administered with imiquimod 5% cream three times per week up to 16 weeks. The follow-up period was 2 years. Complete disappearance of genital warts within 1 year from baseline was observed in 34 (94.4%) patients. Two patients with anogenital warts after 1 year were treated for 1 year 3 months and 1 year and 4 months with Solcoderm which lead to the complete disappearance of genital warts. There were no recurrences of genital warts during the 2 years of follow-up.

H. Try to get local hyperthermia (44 celsius degrees for 50-60 minutes)

> Local hyperthermia has been successfully used in the treatment of viral warts by mechanisms that have largely remained unclear. Using an organotypic culture system, we found that hyperthermia at 42 Â°C and 45 Â°C could induce a significant increase in the transcriptional expression of interferon (IFN)-Î±, IFN-Î² and IFN-Î³, in a temperature-dependent manner in condyloma acuminata (CA), but not in normal skin. Accordingly, local hyperthermia could enhance the expression of 2â€²-5â€² oligoadenylate synthase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase, two antiviral enzymes downstream of the IFN-dependant pathway.

I. Vaccine yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9.  They are not therapeutic vaccines but...

>  Background: Various therapeutic modalities have been implemented for wart treatment. Recently, resistant warts treated using quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine have been reported, although original articles on the efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine on viral warts are rare. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the treatment of multiple warts Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients with multiple warts who had been treated with quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Pusan National University Hospital from January 2014 to November 2016. All patients received 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine at baseline, 2 and 6 months. Patient demographics and clinical features were reviewed. Therapeutic response and adverse reactions following vaccination were assessed. Results: Regarding therapeutic response, 14 patients (46.67%) showed â€œComplete responseâ€, 5 (16.67%) showed â€œPartial responseâ€, and 11 (36.67%) showed â€œNo responseâ€. There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, disease duration, and lesion number and location between the three groups divided by treatment response. No severe adverse events were noted. Conclusion: The advantage of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the treatment of multiple warts is that it is more convenient and less painful. HPV vaccine might be a good alternative to conventional destructive methods for certain cases such as those including multiple warts, dangerous lesion locations, and uncooperative patients.

How to fight with HPV genital warts recurrences?,5,7wesdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPV/comments/7wesdd/how_to_fight_with_hpv_genital_warts_recurrences/,0,1518224198,"**PROBLEM:**

> Recurrence of anogenital warts within 3 months is common (approximately 30%)

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/surv-manual/chpt05-hpv.html

**Possible solutions:**

A. Check your glucose level and do HbA1c test. There is a correlation between GW recurrences and diabetes.

> Through clinical practice, it is often perceived that patients with diabetes are more likely to suffer from severe and recalcitrant warts. This study was set up to investigate if genital warts were more common in patients with diabetes and to determine if patients with diabetes and genital warts required more treatment than those without diabetes. Only female patients with diabetes and genital warts were investigated and were compared to the non-diabetic population. Results suggested that patients with diabetes had more extensive warts and recurrences.

B. Try antiviral herbs: Ellagic acid (i.e. from Pomegranate extract) and Annona Muricata extract. You can order EA+AM from iHerb.

> Ellagic acid (EA) and Annona Muricata (AM) have antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antiviral activity demonstrated by in vitro models. This pilot study investigated the in vivo potential anti-viral activity in women affected by Low squamous intraepithelial lesion (L-SIL) related to high risk human papilloma virus (HR-HPV), and the ability to modify the oncoproteins expression in the cervical lesion thickness. Sixty women affected by HR-HPV related L-SIL, were randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 30) supplemented with EA (16 mg) + AM (100 mg) 2 times daily for 6 months and group B (n = 30) administered with placebo. HR-HPV clearance was obtained in 74% of cases in group A compared to 25% of cases in group B (p = 0.001) and p21 expression in LSIL thickness increased in 63.2% of cases in group A compared to 20% in group B (p = 0.03). AE/AM supplementation significantly induces HR-HPV elimination and stimulates p21 expression in LSIL thickness.

C. Try medicinal mushrooms: Coriolus Versicolor and Reishi. Only extracts are effective. Mushroom powders = placebo.

> This preliminary randomized study investigated the efficacy of medicinal mushrooms, Trametes versicolor (TV), Ganoderma lucidum (GL), and Laetiporus sulphureus (LS), on the clearance of oral human papillomavirus (HPV, serotypes 16 and 18). Among 472 patients who underwent oral swabs for gingivitis, 61 patients were positive for HPV16 or HPV18. Twenty patients were included in group 1 (LS) and 41 patients were included in group 2 (TV+GL) for 2 months. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HPV was performed at inclusion and after 2 months. In group 1, the clearance was equal to 5% after 2 months of treatment. In group 2, the clearance was equal to 88% (P<0.001). The detection of HPV16 or HPV18 could become relevant in routine since positivity is frequent and because a harmless and costless treatment may exist. The use of TV+GL for the clearance of oral HPV deserves further investigation.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25271984#

D. Combine Cryotherapy or Podophyllotoxin with Panavir, antiviral gel made in Russia. You can order Panavir from online pharmacies.

> The article presents the results of treatment of 51 men with recurrent genital HPV infection in the form of genital warts. Patients were divided into two groups depending on the treatment. Group 1 of patients has received the combination treatment--electrocoagulation + pharmacotherapy (panavir intravenously and topically in the form of a gel), Group 2 of patients--only electrocoagulation. According to the results of follow-up within 6 months, disease recurrence rate was significantly higher in Group 2--39.5% versus 9.6% in the Group 1. Postoperative complications were also more frequently recorded in the Group 2. These findings suggest that the combined treatment of reccurent forms of genital warts is preferred than just using destructive methods of treatment.

http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/24649765

> This research is devoted to determination of the clinical efficacy of Panavir in the combined therapy of the uterine cervix diseases associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). The article presents data of the complex examination of 59 patients. Patients with diagnosed 16th, 18th, 31st, 33rd types of HPV underwent destructive methods of treatment of the cervix followed by Panavir. The efficacy of Panavir was estimated by PCR in 3, 6 and 12 months from the beginning of treatment and it was 84,7%. Antiviral therapy permits to prevent recurrence of papillomavirus infection of the cervix uteri.

http://journals.rudn.ru/medicine/article/view/3463

E. Try Solanum incanum extract, SR-T100 gel.

> In this pilot study of condyloma treatment, 19 (73%) of 26 patients using the SR-T100 gel (2.3% solamargine in Solanum incanum plant extract) exhibited a response, and 16 (61.5%) patients achieved total clearance. In addition, only one patient showed a severe (grade 3-4) skin-related side effect. Although an extract of Solanum dulcamara L. has been reported in folk medicine to treat warts, this is the first reported trial of the use of solamargine to treat condyloma.

https://www.reddit.com/domain/transmedcomms.biomedcentral.com/

F. Combine Cryotherapy or Podophyllotoxin with Inosine Pranobex (3g daily, 14-28 days)

> This study evaluates the effectiveness of immunomodulating drug isoprinosine in a comprehensive treatment of genital warts in men. Most of the patients were aged 20-30 years. The combination therapy was found to have long term effectiveness. In the group of patients undergoing only destructive methods of treatment relapse after 8 month follow-up was diagnosed in 32% and in patients of the combination therapy group (destruction plus isoprinosine) - in 7% of patients. The pharmacological action of the drug (immunostimulating, antiviral) and the effectiveness of its combination with destructive therapies justify the use of inosine pranobex (isoprinosine) both in the complex therapy of genital warts and for the prevention of the disease recurrence.

G. Combine Imiquimod with Gardasil / Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine. Imiquimod / Aldara is not very effective in males, but it seems that Imiquimod + full vaccination is much more effective.

> The study comprised 36 patients, including 22 men, aged 26.4+/-4.1 years, who had from 1 to 5 anogenital warts. Participants of the study were vaccinated by quadrivalent recombinant vaccine under a 3-dose scheme 0-2-6 months co-administered with imiquimod 5% cream three times per week up to 16 weeks. The follow-up period was 2 years. Complete disappearance of genital warts within 1 year from baseline was observed in 34 (94.4%) patients. Two patients with anogenital warts after 1 year were treated for 1 year 3 months and 1 year and 4 months with Solcoderm which lead to the complete disappearance of genital warts. There were no recurrences of genital warts during the 2 years of follow-up.

H. Try to get local hyperthermia (44 celsius degrees for 50-60 minutes)

> Local hyperthermia has been successfully used in the treatment of viral warts by mechanisms that have largely remained unclear. Using an organotypic culture system, we found that hyperthermia at 42 Â°C and 45 Â°C could induce a significant increase in the transcriptional expression of interferon (IFN)-Î±, IFN-Î² and IFN-Î³, in a temperature-dependent manner in condyloma acuminata (CA), but not in normal skin. Accordingly, local hyperthermia could enhance the expression of 2â€²-5â€² oligoadenylate synthase and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase, two antiviral enzymes downstream of the IFN-dependant pathway.

I. Vaccine yourself with Gardasil or Gardasil 9.  They are not therapeutic vaccines but...

>  Background: Various therapeutic modalities have been implemented for wart treatment. Recently, resistant warts treated using quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine have been reported, although original articles on the efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine on viral warts are rare. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the treatment of multiple warts Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 30 patients with multiple warts who had been treated with quadrivalent HPV vaccine in Pusan National University Hospital from January 2014 to November 2016. All patients received 3 doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine at baseline, 2 and 6 months. Patient demographics and clinical features were reviewed. Therapeutic response and adverse reactions following vaccination were assessed. Results: Regarding therapeutic response, 14 patients (46.67%) showed â€œComplete responseâ€, 5 (16.67%) showed â€œPartial responseâ€, and 11 (36.67%) showed â€œNo responseâ€. There were no statistically significant differences in sex, age, disease duration, and lesion number and location between the three groups divided by treatment response. No severe adverse events were noted. Conclusion: The advantage of quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the treatment of multiple warts is that it is more convenient and less painful. HPV vaccine might be a good alternative to conventional destructive methods for certain cases such as those including multiple warts, dangerous lesion locations, and uncooperative patients.

A guy you're dating tells you he had genital warts in the past. How do you react?,8,6oxagd,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/6oxagd/a_guy_youre_dating_tells_you_he_had_genital_warts/,21,1500784823,"So imagine you've been dating a guy (mid 20's - [M26]), you've been talking for a few weeks, dates have been going well, you guys have some chemistry and get along well. On the 3rd/4th date he discloses that he had genital warts 6-12 months ago.


**History:** I found I had this condition from a girl I dated around a year ago, it was never a long term relationship as she was finishing college that year and moving back home (3-4 hours away from me). She was unaware that she had it, told me later when she found them. (We used condoms every time).


**Info:** Genital warts have no serious impact on my health, it's just a few small warts that go away shortly after treatment (they can recur) and only impacts my dating life. Girls have been receiving a vaccine (Gardasil) since 2008 (Australia), 2012 (UK) - (Unsure on US dates) which protects against the strains of HPV that causes 90% of genital warts.


How do you react, and would you consider getting the Gardasil vaccine if you liked the guy enough?


All opinions/answers are welcome, but as I am from the UK - Getting the opinions of a female in the UK will be extremely helpful! (please still answer even if you are not from the UK)


**Edit:** Women are able to get the vaccine up to age 26+, generally says to the age of 26 as they assume you've likely been exposed to HPV by that age.


TL;DR - How would you react if a guy you've been dating (things go well, multiple dates) disclosed he had genital warts 6-12 months ago - "
Help me with an insecurity/HPV,0,7j3u4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7j3u4w/help_me_with_an_insecurityhpv/,4,1513043507,"Hi guys. I have kind of a strange question/concern that I'm hoping the good people of r/sex can help me with. I'm male, early-mid twenties, and currently struggling with a nagging concern in the back of my mind.

I'm a very analytical and risk-averse sort of person, and for me the idea of getting an STD has always been horrifying. (By no means do I wish to offend anyone who has an incurable STD, I am simply stating my own feelings which may/may not be entirely rational. Nevertheless, it is important for context to understand that I am exceedingly averse to contracting one myself.)

As a result of this attitude among other reasons, I have restricted my sexual activities over the course of my life, never allowing/choosing for myself to behave particularly promiscuously. (While you'll have to take my word for it, I should also probably say that I don't believe I am unattractive, in fact I would likely be considered fairly good-looking by most standards). Still, I have never had a one night stand. And when single I would always turn down the offers of women who I did not know (well-enough) who wished to engage in sexual activities. Why is this? I couldn't quite say, except that the idea of sleeping with someone I don't know seems quite unappealing, even scary. It has always seemed like I am in the minority among men, and my unwillingness to be casually intimate with women often results in my masculinity or maturity being impugned somehow. 

I also wish to clarify one more thing for context, but I am concerned that if mis-read, I will become the target of a certain amount of negativity. Basically, I find too much promiscuity (in others) to be unattractive. 

Before you bring out the pitchforks, I would NEVER treat someone poorly or even differently after learning of their sexual past. Really. I promise. Really really.

I simply find it unattractive for me !personally! (emphasis on personally, largely due to an increased risk of STDs). 
The number of partners itself matters little, except in terms of how it relates to their past behavior. (i.e. having sex with lots of people in a short time is worse to me than having lots of sex with a few people over a long time). 
I realize this is not entirely rational, and may even be some type of compulsive thought, but it is how I feel.
 For example, I will even be less willing to share a beverage from the same glass (as often happens socially) with someone who I know is very promiscuous. Don't get me wrong, I would never create an awkward situation or let someone know they had made me feel this way, but I must admit that the aversion exists. 

I also DO NOT have a double standard, this applies equally to men as well as women, especially in the exact example of the drinking-aversion I described above. It also only applies to how I feel INTERNALLY, and is NOT how I socialize. I have male and female friends who have LOTS of sex with different people, they are still my friends and our friendship has no relevance or correlation to their sexual activities. I also have friends (male and female) who are sexually conservative. Basically what I'm saying is, I don't consider myself sex-negative really at all, so much as hyper-concerned with how sex might vector diseases. I'm fairly liberal and progressive, non-religious, and I don't view sex in a moral context at all really, merely a biological one.

 I apologize for my lengthy exposition, I simply wish for you to understand where I'm coming from before I get to the crux of the issue. 

Basically, I'm hoping you can help me decide if it is worthwhile for me to go through the expense and trouble of getting the HPV vaccine as a male. 

As I said, I'm analytical, so I felt the best way of approaching this was to try and calculate the odds that I have already been exposed. I have had one sexual partner in my lifetime, and she is also the only woman who has ever given me oral or manual stimulation. So basically, if I have contracted anything, it is almost certainly from her. We have been very happy in a long term monogamous relationship for the last three years. She herself had six sexual partners prior to me, and sexual contact with eight individuals total if you include oral, etc. I understand that HPV can stay in someone's system without presenting symptoms, and also that it can go away on its own after two to three years, so with that in mind I can provide a bit of longitudinal data. I have no desire to grill her for more precise details, since that would be rude, but this is all the information I already possess.
Two to three of her sexual partners were within a year prior to my first getting involved with her, with the others spread out over her seven year sexual history before meeting me. She has never presented any symptoms of HPV nor tested positive, though I also understand that HPV is frequently left out of standard screenings because of the high incidence rate. She took the virginity of at least one, potentially two of the past partners mentioned (three if you include me), so they can likely be excluded as potential vectors. That said, neither of those were the more recent partners, who are therefore relatively more high-risk as a function of having likely had more partners themselves.

With those odds, do you think it is likely I have already been exposed or no? I understand that due to my gender and age, I may be unable to get the vaccine without paying out of pocket since it is unlikely to be covered by my insurance, so it wouldn't be a casual investment. If I was still HPV-free for certain, I would undoubtedly get the vaccine for the peace of mind of knowing I was protected. However, since my exposure status is in question, I am not certain I can justify the expense.

So what do you all think? Should I get it? Or is it likely I've already been exposed through my partner?

Part of me is thinking that the vaccine is worthwhile due to the fact that there are different strains, and the vaccine will have protective benefits for any of the most high risk types that I haven't been exposed already. 

I feel that while it is unlikely my exposure is zero due to my SO having had six past partners (while it varies among age groups, common sources say as many as one in four has HPV), then even if I have already contracted one or two varieties I should still protect myself from the others, no? What do you guys think?

How to afford regular STI testing and prevention? I am broke and my insurance is awful / nonexistent.,1,7bjqie,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/7bjqie/how_to_afford_regular_sti_testing_and_prevention/,6,1510153648,"I am a 45-year-old heteroflexible guy who would like to begin regularly having ethically nonmonogamous sex with multiple partners.  I've been lurking on the edges of the poly world for three years, and am ready to take a deeper dive.  Ideally I see myself with two or three regular female partners, and one regular oral-only male partner.  I may also want to participate in some MFM, MMF, and MMFM scenarios.

I do plan to use condoms for all penetrative sex.  I would really rather not use them for giving or receiving oral.  I plan to discuss testing history with my partners, but I can't depend on that to protect me entirely.  When you're poly and sleeping with other poly people, that's a pretty big network that some sort of bug could spread around.

Before I do this, I want to have a plan in place for regular STI testing and prevention.  My thinking is that at minimum I should get tested every three months for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, trich, and chlamydia.  I've also considered whether it makes sense to get Hepatitis B and HPV vaccines (thought most providers will not give the latter to anyone over 26).

Right now I have some really crappy short-term insurance plan that doesn't cover much of anything.  I'm in the process of signing up for ACA coverage through Healthcare.gov.  I'll have to get the cheapest Bronze plan, which looks like it's going to run me around $330/mo.  After paying for insurance, I'm not going to have much money left over.  I make about $39K/year, but most of that is going to debt repayment at the moment.  So, I'm on a pretty tight budget.

I know that ACA health insurance covers some STI screening, but is it really going to cover me if I ask for a full panel of tests every three months?  If I explain my nonmonogamous activity to my primary care doctor, is he likely to order the tests?  (I'm pretty open with my doc, but I feel weird about telling him that I have sex with lots of men and women.)

My local county health department offers free HIV screening, but there is no other free testing available in my area.  If my health insurance won't cover it, I'll have to pay for the remaining tests out of pocket.  I've shopped around, and I'm looking at $210 for each set of tests.  I'm sort of embarrassed to say it, but I can't swing that.  With all the debt I'm paying down, I can't even afford a car at the moment.

Does my proposed screening regimen make sense?  Should I get the additional vaccinations?  Does anyone have any experience getting frequent STI screening through ACA health insurance?  Any tips for how I can get the tests out of pocket for less than $210?"

(/r/AskScience x-post),3,79t1c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virology/comments/79t1c2/age_limits_for_vaccines_raskscience_xpost/,2,1509448064,"I was recently looking over the [CDC recommended immunization schedule for adults](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/downloads/adult/adult-combined-schedule.pdf) and I noticed a couple of oddities. Most notably is the HPV vaccine. Why isn't this recommended for males past age 21 and for females past age 26? Is there a biological reason that people become less susceptible as they age? On a related note, why is 1957 the cutoff birth year for MMR vaccine?"

Gardasil vaccine indication or danger for adults?,1,6svtqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/6svtqa/gardasil_vaccine_indication_or_danger_for_adults/,5,1502423194,"Female, 35, 170/60kg,  European caucasian, no complaints or illnesses nor medications, no smoking etc., monogameous.

What I understand:


- This gardasil vaccine is a great invention and recommended for teenagers. Sometimes for sexually never active young adults(?). 


- it does not protect against hpv that a person had contact to before. It would help against the other strains though.

My conclusion and question 1: 

In the worst case it would not help anything (if contact to all strains was made before) but also not do harm.
Or would there be more serious reactions to the vaccine due to antibodies? Is that even possible with those viruses, or do the not cause antibodies to form?

Question 2: should an adult with few past partners (in my case three) consider getting the vaccine in the small hope of partial protection against some strains the person did not have exposure to?

Question 3: Costs aside, would it be practicable and possible to get tested for these hpv strains to see if a vaccination still makes sense? Or is this something that can't be tested from a blood sample? 

Question 4: Did any MDs here get the vaccine for themselves despite not being in the target age group?

I am currently reading this source: http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/Handbook10-home~handbook10part4~handbook10-4-6



(Edited out because I had a brainfart and mixed up HPV and HSV like  an idiot.)

My boyfriend and I are together for 10 years, which is why we sometimes do not use condoms (we don't mind getting a kid at this stage). He does not have genital warts.

As small as the benefit may be, if I did not have contact to all strains in the vaccine, it would still be useful, right?

Thank you in advance, folks!"
How can men support feminism?,13,50ozxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/50ozxe/how_can_men_support_feminism/,92,1472786370,"[This article](http://www.xojane.com/issues/feminism-men-practical-steps) seems to identify the multiple practical step that all men can use to promote feminism and not contribute to a culture of gender inequality. I'll do a shortlist here, but please go ahead and check the original article as well, especially if a point seems funky, most of them have some reasoning.

1. Do 50% (or more) of housework.

2. Do 50% (or more) of emotional support work in your intimate relationships and friendships.

3. Consume cultural products produced by women.

4. Give women space.

5. â€¦ but insert yourself into spaces where you can use your maleness to interrupt sexism.

6. When a woman tells you something is sexist, believe her.

7. Educate yourself about sexual consent and make sure there is clear, unambiguous communication of consent in all your sexual relationships.

8. Be responsible for contraception.

9. Get the HPV vaccine.

10. Have progressive name politics.

11. If you have children, be an equal parent.

12. Pay attention to and challenge informal instances of gender role enforcement.

14. Make sure that honesty and respect guide your romantic and sexual relationships with women.

15. Donâ€™t be an online bystander in the face of sexism.

16. Be responsible with money in domestic/romantic relationships.

17. Be responsible for your own health.

18. Donâ€™t ogle or make comments about women. (i.e., Keep your tongue in your mouth and comments to yourself.)

19. Pay attention to the sex of experts and key figures presenting information to you in the media.

20. Ensure that some of your heroes and role models are women.

21. Praise the virtues and accomplishments of women in your life to others.

22. Have integrity with your male friends. (i.e., Donâ€™t be a â€œbro.â€)

23. Donâ€™t treat your spouse like a â€œnag.â€ If she is â€œnagging,â€ you are probably lagging. 

24. Know that acknowledging your own sexist opinions and stereotypes you hold is not enough. Do something about them.

25. Befriend women.

26. Find female mentors/leaders. (i.e., Be subordinate to women.)

27. When in a romantic relationship, be responsible for events and special dates associated with your side of the family.

28. Donâ€™t police womenâ€™s appearance.

29. Offer to accompany female friends if they have to walk home alone at nightâ€¦or in a public space where they may be likely to feel unsafe.

30. Inject feminism into your daily conversations with other men.

31. If you have a tendency to behave inappropriately toward women when you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol, do not consume drugs or alcohol.

32. Be aware of the physical and emotional space you occupy, and donâ€™t take up more space than you need.

33. Walk the walk about income inequality.

34. Get in the habit of treating your maleness as an unearned privilege that you have to actively work to cede rather than femaleness being an unearned disadvantage that women have to work to overcome.

35. Self-identify as a feminist."
HPV Vaccine and a cheating husband,1,6oh2c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/6oh2c6/hpv_vaccine_and_a_cheating_husband/,6,1500594276,"32 y/o female with two children under 3. 
I have just discovered that my husband has cheated on me twice. Once without a condom. This is very recent and he says we have not had any sexual contact since he slept with her. We don't have sex often so I'm sure this is true. Whilst I believe him I will wait a few weeks and then get a sexual health check up - because why not? I will also insist he does the same. We are currently separated but going to counselling and I think we will probably be able to work things out.

My question is about whether I should consider getting the HPV vaccine. When we got together 12 years ago he was a virgin and I had one previous sexual partner (who was also a virgin as we were together young) but we ALWAYS used a condom. My husband and I have two children and so obviously so not use condoms. I have a copper coil now, if that makes a difference. 

I contacted my gp and spoke to a nurse but she advised against the vaccine as they said there was no point as I would already be infected (I didn't think I could be infected by my husband or previous partner if we believe they were virgins - which I do). She explained that all men naturally carry the virus and any woman who has sex will too. She also said that most woman have a natural immunity and were able to fight off the virus quite easily and that as long as I went for my Pap smears I would not need the vaccine. 

I know that the woman my husband slept with has had quite a few boyfriends so I can only speculate as to her sexual health. 

I could get the vaccine in 3 doses from the local pharmacy but this means no sexual contact for 6 months which we both may find difficult but I will do it if it is worth it. 

I suppose I think money and time (6 months) aside there doesn't seem to be any disadvantage to me getting the vaccine but I would love a second opinion. "
"/r/science now under 100% corporate manipulation, banned me for posting about a vaccine I've been following closely for years ""You have already been warned about posting inappropriate comments, you are now banned.""",301,2fsr8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2fsr8o/rscience_now_under_100_corporate_manipulation/,312,1410203805,"Yesterday there was a thread top on the front page of Reddit with an unrealistic amount of upvotes for something which is an incredibly boring topic for the Reddit Hive-Mind, it's obviously been falsely pushed to the top by our corporate friends, they've found a new use for their marketing budgets.  

**61 percent fall in female genital warts due to free HPV vaccine**

http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2fqlxi/61_percent_fall_in_female_genital_warts_due_to/

Some real posters could smell something wasn't right http://i.imgur.com/i7D9DKq.jpg they've clocked that this repetitive pro-vaccine whitewash is a bit odd.  There were also lots of shills posting the Party Line and 'I LOVE SCIENCE!' to drown out the real posters who were posting stories about the horrifying complications which they've witnessed post-vaccine.

Personally, after having read hundreds of studies and case studies on this vaccine over a number of years, I came in to sum up with my own conclusion, but apparently my comments were 'inappropriate', apparently only one side of the story i.e. pro-vaccine, is appropriate.

Going forward the most important thing is that as many people in /r/science as possible realize what's going on and that these posts are just paid-for Big Pharma commercials, not real information with real posters.

For the record, here's my comment on the HPV vaccine which they decided was 'inappropriate'.

--------------------------------------------

Right, so apparently these ruthless corporations are willing to destroy their own Cancer Industry for the good of humanity....hmmm...anyone actually believe that? Look into the lifelong autoimmune diseases being induced by this vaccine, they are highly profitable diseases leaving people dependent on expensive drugs for the rest of their lives. Sorry folks, that's the only way this makes sense, that's the only way this jigsaw fits together properly.

Look into why Japan has stopped their HPV program, read up on why Spain, France and India are all considering a ban on the vaccine.

Don't believe the Reddit Hivemind Hype, look into these topics yourself and keep away from corporate controlled sites like the CDC and FDA, that why you'll stay clear of propaganda.

Opinions on an HPV vaccination?,10,5rrwpk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/5rrwpk/opinions_on_an_hpv_vaccination/,18,1486125241,"Hi /r/AskDocs! I'm looking for some advice in terms of whether or not I should receive a particular vaccine; particularly, the HPV vaccine. Some background:

I'm 16 years old and male, and live in the U.S.. I currently have a girlfriend, but we ***are not*** currently sexually active, in terms of full-contact sex, this has not happened and we do not intend it to for some time. I have to note that we may choose to begin sexual activities (as in full-contact sex) eventually, but likely not for a few months from now at the very least. I'd also like to state that, while appreciated, I truthfully do not need ""the talk."" I've already had it from both my parents and physician; I don't mean to be arrogant, but both me and my girlfriend are smart students and highly value our futures. When we do begin this, we will be sure to engage in full safety.

Anyways, recently my doctor has been highly suggesting the HPV vaccination. At first I was entirely in agreement, I didn't see any reason *not* to. However, after talking with my mother who, apparently, had done some research has found a plethora of issues on the topic; many concerned recipients of the virus have experienced undesirable side effects, and she's delved into government-backed lawsuits against the vaccination, some with side effects such as *infertility.*

I've spoken with her gynecologist (as I've requested a meeting with her for this exact issue, long story), and she often suggests to some of her young female patients to avoid it for some of these exact reasons. She said she'll email me with some more evidence or ideas on the subject if I'd like.

Now I've yet to to a ton of research on my own and have only seen some of the things she's directly showed me. I figured I may as well ask here, to see what you guys have to say.

Any insight is appreciated, and any sourcing and documentation is as well. Many thanks!"
Questinioning my gender. Pretty confused right now. (possible TW?),2,71g4en,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/71g4en/questinioning_my_gender_pretty_confused_right_now/,2,1505988964,"Yo, I'm super confused here. I don't know anything anymore. 
(This is way longer than I wanted it to be. Kinda feel silly for having written this much about my shitty feeling â€“ Iâ€˜m nervous tbh because this feels so personal)

Also, TW for a bit of self-harm/-mutilation talk.

I canâ€˜t recall too much of my childhood but there are at least a few memories which always stuck with me.
Back in kindergarten I never really felt like a girl. I donâ€˜t remember feeling like a guy either but the more I think about it the more I start to believe that this was for a different reason â€“ I could look at the boys around me and recognize that they were different from me in appearence which obviously meant that I couldnâ€˜t be one of them. 
When we were role-playing I also preferred to be a male character. At one point I started thinking this was weird and embarassing so I started to repress it (this was way later on, when I was in elementary).
Also remember stuffing my pants when I was alone and I never knew what to think of that. Donâ€˜t know much about elementary, only that I felt completely alienated from the girls like they were speaking a different language. I still had female friends and that was ok but for the most part I felt quite wrong. 

My childhood wasn't all that great but also not all that bad. My family is a bit of a mess â€“ my grandparents are very controlling, my mom is a bit overbearing and my father never gave a shit about me and only hit me/told me he was going to kill me/told me to fuck off. Iâ€˜m not really angry at any of this â€“ there are reasons why they are like this and whatâ€˜s done is done. 
However I had some anger issues as a kid and got sent to a therapist for this. Donâ€˜t remember much about that either but a few years later she told me that I never really talked to her about anything. 

Then puberty came and my life went to hell.
I hated myself. I hated my body. I was disgusted with it. I still am. I've met quite a few mentally ill people because I've been
to hospitals due to self-harm, skipping school and a suicide attempt but I can't remember anyone having such problems with their body like
I do. Kinda arrogant to assume this but most of them didnâ€˜t have problems with watching videos of themselves or  were in romantic relationships, both which do not work for me. I canâ€˜t look at pictures of myself or in the mirror â€“ the person I see is wrong. I have a hard time believing this is my body because I have no real connection to it. Itâ€˜s like Iâ€˜m trapped in it. When Iâ€˜m not â€šawareâ€˜ of it Iâ€˜m more like a floating consciousness but once I take a look at myself Iâ€˜m back in reality.
The thought of someone touching me â€šdown thereâ€˜ or â€šup thereâ€˜ repulses me to no end. It makes me sick. My breasts feel like they were clued on by someone else, I LOATHE my period to no end, my vagina is weird and I hate my curves. 
For the most part I started to ignore it (never took track of my period, stopped taking care of myself when puberty came around, never went to a gynecologicst, never gave a shit about that HPV vaccine although I did get it, etc.) and get miserable whenever I was reminded that I was â€štrappedâ€˜ in here (e.g., by looking in the mirror). But I sometimes had and have the urge to cut my own breasts off, to stab my vagina or I always hoped that I would get cancer so people would remove my uterus. Also had two phases where I starved myself because I couldnâ€˜t stand my curves. 
I thought this was just some self-harming shit like how one of the reasons why Iâ€˜m cutting is because I actually want to fuck my body up.
But itâ€˜s not like I have any reason to hate my body like this because honestly, nobody ever told me that Iâ€˜m ugly or anything. If they did I canâ€˜t remember.

Kinda had the idea of binding my breasts and starting to wear boy clothes when I was 16 but dropped it because I was too shy to try it. Also tried a few times to be more girly, to dress myself more feminine, to put on some make-up but it never really felt right at all, just like a mask I was wearing. I avoid wearing 'feminine' clothing and whenever I do I'm really uncomfortable.

I also have some serious confusion when it comes to my sexual orientation. Iâ€˜m kinda positive that Iâ€˜m attracted to guys but the thought of being with a guy and being the â€šwomanâ€˜ just seems so wrong. I have some attraction to ladies too and I can accept that a little bit better but not to the point where I would let a girl touch me. Kinda messes me up because everything I consider (Straight? Bi? Gay?) just seems wrong. It doesnâ€˜t fit.

And yeah. Sometimes I get this sensation of having a flat chest or a penis (like weird phantom limb syndrome) but whenever I try to check my breasts are in the way or thereâ€˜s nothing there which always distresses me a little. Nothing that makes me heavily depressed though â€“ itâ€˜s more like being annoyed that I was born with this shit. 

I just ignored a lot of things. I went through life like I was a robot, somewhat detached from myself and the world around me. Nothing ever seemed right and I just wanted to die tbh.
I was aware of trans people ever since I was 14 and I never had a problem with it. It was just how it  is. I never really knew what HRT can do and I never thought of it all that much. Kinda avoided it too, it wasnâ€˜t just something I wanted to deal with. 
But then a friend of a friend came out and I met a few transman online and it kinda messed me up a bit. I thought I was transphobic at first but itâ€˜s also a bit like I was jealous, like they could be who they were and I was just stuck in this shitty body. 
And then I found out what HRT can actually do and that you can top surgery (how naive is this? Why did never really think about this before? WTF) and ever since then things have been getting worse. At first I thought it was some
kink stuff but then I couldn't stop thinking of going through that myself and that this was actually something that sounded incredibly appealing to me. 

Not sure what to think of all that. Am I in phase? Am I having some weird crisis? Is this related to my mental illness?
Because I'm not sure what to think of social transition. Taking on a male name and male pronouns sounds weird and unusual but not exactly awful (I mean, I get a rush whenever someone thought I was a dude online but one time this happened irl and it kinda upset me because I thought being masculine as a girl means that you failed and are unattractive, wtf). Don't really if
I do want to be seen as a man by others - I mean, I guess. Maybe. Iâ€˜m kinda scared I canâ€˜t fully blend in with the other guys or that I might come across as creepy and weird (Iâ€˜m quite shy and awkward and crippled by my anxiety and I guess people are more accepting of that if you are a girl). 

Oh yeah, and of course there is mental illness. I've been diagnosed with recurrent/chronic depression and avpd. There is a chance that I might have bpd - one of my therapists
thought about it and dismissed it because I wasn't showing enough symptoms or I was too young and another suggested it but I only had her for five sessions.
It kinda made sense to me though with all the self-harm, the self-hatred, my confusion over my sexuality, etc. but now Iâ€˜m not so sure anymore. 

And there's my family of course. I doubt my sister would care and my parents are pretty tolerant but everyone else would probably lose their shit. Not that that would influence me in anything but it would be very hurtful.

Iâ€˜m so scared I might just be some shitty girl who has a identity crisis. The thought of this makes me want to scream because part of me makes me feel like something would be taken away from me. For the first time in my life I have something that might explain all those extremely negative feelings I have about my body, why I never related to the person in the mirror, why I was so scared of physical intimancy, something that makes *sense*. I always dreaded the idea of growing old as a woman to the point where I planned on killing myself before I was 30. I never really saw a future for myself but now I can at least imagine one. But what if Iâ€˜m making this all up, desperate to find something that might ease my self-hatred?

I canâ€˜t stop thinking about this. I'm way more aware of my body now and it's driving me mad. I really want to talk to my old therapist about this but Iâ€˜m so afraid she might laugh at me and think Iâ€˜m fucking crazy because Iâ€˜m making shit up.  "
How much can UHIP cover HPV vaccine?,5,6hbwm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/6hbwm1/how_much_can_uhip_cover_hpv_vaccine/,3,1497518322,"Only find [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/1a04hg/does_the_health_plan_we_get_through_the/) which is already 4 years old. My friends got it fully covered under UHIP last year, but UHIP webpage's FAQ states that HPV is not covered. Really confusing.

So how much shall I (20, female) pay for an HPV vaccine? And where can I get it (ideally on campus)?

Thanks."
HPV cancers in Males were finally recognised by major TV networks in Canada.,23,58hj8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/58hj8t/hpv_cancers_in_males_were_finally_recognised_by/,12,1477006965,"Normally we only hear about women's health issues on TV news such as breast cancer 
so last evening I was quite surprised that the major TV networks in Canada
raised awareness that mouth and throat cancers caused by HPV is on the rise among 
Canadian men and were pointing how vaccination was available to girls in all provinces but not in all provinces for boys.


But they didn't say anything if the vaccine works on adult men or encouraged adult men to get vaccinated. 



I don't know why they finally recognized this problem in men as this is very unusual in Canada.


Probably to save the women?

""Between 1992 and 2012, the incidence of HPV-related mouth and throat cancers increased 56 per cent in males and 17 per cent in females.""

""But itâ€™s now more common to see HPV-related throat and mouth cancers in younger, otherwise healthy patients.""

""Recent studies suggest that oropharyngeal cancer will become the most common HPV-associated malignancy by the year 2020, surpassing cancer of the cervix,â€

Need advice and reassurance on a myriad of rising health concerns,3,6digxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/6digxo/need_advice_and_reassurance_on_a_myriad_of_rising/,6,1495849314,"Hi friends,

In the past month I have found out that I have a lump in my right breast, am HPV positive and came back with an abnormal pap. I'm also currently experiencing the weirdest period of my life where I'm cramping horribly and feeling normal PMS symptoms but there is little to no blood, and what is there is old and brown.

I don't know anything about my breast lump yet, I have a follow up in a few weeks to see if it has changed size and my doctor will then determine if I need a mammogram.

Finding out about the HPV has been the most upsetting as I have bad anxiety and this is unfamiliar territory. I will be getting a colposcopy in the next couple of weeks as well to see the severity of the cell abnormalities and I am very nervous. I would love to know I'm not the only one who has had to go through that and what other women have experienced or found out from these tests. Logically I am not TOO concerned as I had the Gardisil vaccine a few years ago but I still get anxious in regards to anything health related.

I am also concerned that I may be pregnant as I have had unprotected sex with a partner in the past month, even though I have a Skyla IUD. The strings are there and in place but I have never had a period like this where I expect to have my normal first couple of days of heavy bleeding but my menstrual cup is virtually empty. I have had my Skyla for a little over a year and about a 20 day cycle. My period is on time if that's what it is, but I am also concerned that it could be early pregnancy symptoms instead. 

I don't have any immediate female friends that I can discuss this with so any advice or positivity would be much appreciate. Thanks in advance.

Edit: Definitely not pregnant. Decided to pee on a stick for a peace of mind and all is well. I think that was more me anticipating something else bad happening with the past couple of weeks I've had."

She told me that it was impossible due to the length of time I had been on the birth control and that I would have seen symptoms earlier. A month later I get a bill from the lab company and she tested me for pretty much every STD out there, I have been with the same partner for 8 years. she did not tell me she was running those tests, I noticed she tested me for HPV High-Risk Types and when I was 17 I received the Guradasil vaccine. I am currently stuck with a $230 lab bill that my insurance will not cover, they won't ever cover the full ""Cytopath C/V Auto Fluid"" only $22.75 of the $85.19
I can't afford this, is there anything I can do?"

Birth control can lead to having unprotected sexy times and not worrying as much (about babies); but should I be worried about HPV?,11,4yqk7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/4yqk7v/birth_control_can_lead_to_having_unprotected_sexy/,13,1471748426,"Hi Ladies (and guys)! Everyone in this subreddit has always been so kind and helpful so I thought this would be a safe place for a somewhat birth control-related discussion. 

As I've been doing research on birth control (never had it before but starting Nexplanon next week) I've become more knowledgable about risks surrounding sex. I just learned about HPV (which is weird - I knew about all the other common STDs - you think they'd teach people about HPV but I live in the US so...yeah.). 

Since birth control will allow my boyfriend and I to fool around more without condoms but still be protected (from babies), I'm just a little bit concerned with what I've learned about HPV. We haven't had unprotected sex (always condoms) and don't really touch our genitals together (I'm overly weird about not wanting to be pregnant) but we've both done oral so maybe this is a moot point in regards to HPV. 

Those of you who have decided to do things more unprotected, do you worry about HPV? Neither of us have the vaccine and he just had an STD test and bloodwork and everything came back clean (I'll do mine next week). But I'm concerned that there's not really any way to test for HPV in men (which seems like bullshit) and that it can lay dormant for awhile. So it's basically just a crap shoot if I could be getting a virus that could give me/us various types of cancer. I feel pretty helpless about it. I've only had sex with one person before my current bf and we were each other's firsts (and never touched genitals, always used condoms, only once did oral) - I know there's a chance I could have it but my initial guess is that I don't. I'm more concerned about my boyfriend having it and it being dormant (no warts) because he's had more partners in the past and his last ex was a crazy (abusive) bitch who cheated on him (with *at least* one person, probably more) and slept with him after the fact, before he found out. [Thankfully we're both now in an extremely healthy relationship with each other. :) ]

I'm 23 (f) and he's 24 (m) - I could still get the vaccine, but my body can be pretty sensitive to things so I'd be worried how I would physically react to it (I'm still physically recovering from a month-long infection in both of my kidneys that the doctors were too ignorant to treat until I ended up in the hospital). I'm also concerned about possible side effects from the vaccine, though I haven't had a chance to do research on what those side effects are yet. He's too old to get the vaccine (from what I've read, anyway), but I don't know if it would even do anything *if* he already has it anyway. 

I'll be talking to my doctor when I get the implant this coming week but I also wanted to hear from everyone on here if it's as big of a concern as I feel like it is, and how you all have approached unprotected sex and HPV. :/

**TL;DR: Should I be concerned about HPV with unprotected sexy times? Feeling pretty helpless that there's no test for men and the only way to tell for females is with the growth of abnormal cervix cells; plus, there's no cure. Should I be this worried about it?**

Hi everyone! First, thank you all so much for the replies, personal experiences, and well wishes! I really appreciate it and I love how this community cares about one another. 

I deliberated on what I'd researched about the vaccine, HPV, and my current situation. By the end of it, I had come to an initial conclusion that I felt would be right for me, but still wanted to talk to my doctor about it. During my appointment, we discussed the vaccine, my risk and situation, and he ultimately came to the same conclusion that I had on my own - but it was nice to hear that his opinion was also what I felt was right for me. 

I've decided not to get the vaccine - although I *do* think it's a great, safe vaccine and I would recommend others to get it. There's a chance that my current partner could have some type of HPV, though if he does, it's already likely been passed on to me. We're both young and healthy so there's a good chance that *if* we have it, we'll be able to clear it. I have no doubt whatsoever that our relationship will continue to be monogamous, so there isn't any risk from outside sources. I also mentioned in reply to a comment that I have eczema, so possible side effects of the vaccine may go unnoticed. 

So, all of that combined makes for the best course of action (for me) to be not getting the vaccine, and just being aware of my body and getting pap smears on a regular basis. 

Thank you so much to everyone who commented and helped me to make an educated choice. I was really feeling overwhelmed with this a week ago and I felt like there was no ""right choice"". Thank you all for your well wishes and support - I've only been able to talk about this to my doctor and boyfriend, so I really appreciate you all being there for me. :) "
"[Health insurance, USA] Healthcare provider stated that vaccine would be covered under insurance, a month ago. I received bill from insurance stating vaccine wasn't covered because there was no referral for vaccine. How do I dispute payment and/or negotiate full cost down?",1,5nfma3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/5nfma3/health_insurance_usa_healthcare_provider_stated/,10,1484205439,"**Backstory**  
In December 2016, I went to a local CVS Minuteclinic to get a school mandatory health workup done, such as TB skin test. I have used Minuteclinic in the past for mandatory vaccines such as MMR booster shots through UnitedHealthcare's Student health insurance in the past with no issues with billing. Toward the end of my visit, the healthcare provider asks me if I was interested in and wanted a vaccine for HPV. I made no mention of HPV vaccine during the entire visit. She told me that there were new research and guidelines out showing benefit in getting HPV vaccines for males, when normally they are for females. I asked if it would be covered via insurance and she said it should be since it is a vaccine / preventative medicine. Later she as she was finishing typing up the patient report, she reconfirmed to me that the HPV vaccine shouldn't cost anything out of pocket. I currently still have the Patient Visit Receipt that shows $0.00 next to the charge for HPV.  

**This week**  
I received mail from CVS Minuteclinic billing me for $235. $214 for the HPV vaccine and $21 for Vaccine Injection. In the letter, it states **""UHC Student Resources notified us that you did not have the required referral. This balance is your responsibility. If this is incorrect, contact your insurer""**   

* I did not need a referral in the past to get any vaccinations, thus I didn't expect to have this problem. In hindsight, I shouldn't have assumed that.  
* The healthcare provider at the clinic repeatedly told me that my insurance would cover it. While the final burden is on me, is there any way I can use what she said to nullify/lower the bill?  
* What are the best steps to lower the bill? Who do I contact first (insurance or minuteclinic billing) and what's the proper way to address this issue?**  

Thanks for helping in advance. I've never had this issue in the past before so I'm quite lost on how to negotiate medical bills."

I'm not taking any medications or have any other medical issues that I'm aware of.


On and off for the past couple years, I've experienced intense itching on my labia/perineum area.  About a month ago, I bought a yeast infection treatment (Miconazole Nitrate), but it didn't help.  I finally went to a doctor's office to get it checked out, and I got diagnosed with BV.  My doctor just said that there was a 5-day gel injection treatment available over-the-counter, but she didn't give a specific brand, and I assumed that it'd be easy to find.  I googled around for it, and the only over-the-counter treatments I could find related to vaginal itching were for yeast infections, which I've already done.  All the treatments specifically for BV that I found online were prescription-only, and I never got a prescription.  My question is: what, specifically, can I take to treat this?  Is there an over-the-counter option or do I need to get a prescription?  I'm going back to the doctor's office in two weeks for my second dose of the HPV vaccine, but the itching is driving me nuts, and I want to treat it ASAP.

From what i've read, feminism has actively worked to get the HPV vaccine gadrasil approved(or at least widely distributed): http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2008/09/15/requiring-gardasil-for-us-immigrants/

And to quote a sub article:
""
Inoculation against HPV is particularly important for ensuring that girls and women who are victims of rape or incest are protected from contracting the potentially deadly virus. To be truly effective, the vaccine, like sexuality education, must be given to all teens well before any become sexually active.

Yes. And Iâ€™d like to emphasize the â€œall teensâ€ â€” that would include boys. 

Letâ€™s hope the advisory committee makes the right decision. I have faith that they will""

But in 2014, almost 10 years after its release it's creator confessed that gadrasil causes more deaths(3.6 per 100,000 vaccinations) than cervical cancer(less than 2.4 per 100,000 women in first world countries):
http://thefreethoughtproject.com/lead-developer-hpv-vaccines-clean-warns-parents-young-girls-its-giant-deadly-sca

I remember actively discouraging my female classmates from getting this vaccine back in 2009, when there was an almost obligatory vaccination wave administering gadrasil in my country, because even back then there were stories circulating on debilitating illnesses developing in response to the vaccine, although mainstream media denied these allegations, tricking many girls into getting the vaccine regardless.

What is your view on this topic?"

So this one is going to be a bit long, but I spent a lot of time reading and researching, and in addition to writing this for help and advice, I'm writing it in the hopes that this can be *the* collective thread where people share thoughts, ideas, coping mechanisms, morale and reassurance re: HPV. I'm sick of being alone on this, and I'm sure there are others out there who feel the same.

tl;dr: I probably have HPV. I don't like the idea of being a potential disease vector. I don't want to harm future partners. I met someone I really like. I'm struggling with having to explain this awkward situation. Also, this isn't medical advice, it's my experience. If you think you might have problems, GO SEE A DOCTOR!

Anyway, here's my story:

* Late 2011 - My ex and I start going out.
* Aug 2012 - She tells me she had an abnormal pap smear. She's (understandably) super embarrassed and in tears. She says she had the vaccine but the vaccine doesn't cover all strains. I wasn't vaccinated but it probably wouldn't have helped since it didn't help her. She explains that her doc said that the risk for guys is very low. I'm a bit taken aback and I silently wonder who gave it to who, but ultimately realize that it's unproductive to think about that anyway. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so for a while I stress out about me and / or her getting cancer, but then it subsides. Doc says to keep having sex won't really change anything at that point. We keep having a healthy loving relationship with great sex. No symptoms or signs.
* Early 2014 - She breaks up with me, which is a bit of a shock, and quite a bad time for me. But then I commiserate with some friends, go on a trip, get some perspective, realize it's not really about me and life goes on. We talk again, and we're now on good terms (but not together anymore obviously). Around this time it occurs to me that I probably have (/had?) HPV. I decide not to think about it for a while since I want to take a break from relationships / dating and not worry about it till I get some regularity and peace of mind in my life. 
* Now -  I meet an amazing lady out of random chance. Sheer dumb luck. She's extremely intelligent and can hold interesting conversation (major pants dropper), is fun to be around, beautiful, just an all round brilliant person. We hung out for a while the day we met, and then met again the day after, and have been talking on the internet since. I'm reasonably certain she's also interested, and I'd like to try my luck on asking her out on a date. I would really like nothing more than to have a great time with her discussing all manner of topics, wine, dine, have fun, and if she's okay with it, take her home, cuddle, kiss, and bang. But shit, I might have HPV. :(

*Stats*
=====

A brief interlude. Here's some stats I learned about HPV, with legitimate cited sources. Some are only related to men since that's what I'd been researching. But I hope it'll help give some perspective to those prone to worry.

* ""By age 50, at least 4 out of every 5 women will have been infected with HPV at one point in their lives."" http://m.cdc.gov/en/HealthSafetyTopics/DiseasesConditions/Cancer/HPV/basicInfo

* ""More than 50 percent of sexually active people are infected with HPV at some point in their lives; some studies suggest that more than 80 percent of women will have HPV by age 50."" http://www.ppsev.org/media/documents/8ThingsYouNeedtoKnowAboutHumanPapillomavirus.pdf

* ""Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an extremely common STD, with an estimated 80 percent of sexually active people contracting it at some point in their lives. In most cases, the virus is harmless and most people have no symptoms. The body clears most HPV infections naturally."" http://www.ashasexualhealth.org/std-sti/hpv/overview-and-fast-facts.html

* ""Very few cases of â€œhigh-riskâ€ HPV will lead to cervical cancer, for example, primarily because the immune response is usually able to suppress the virus before cancer develops. In some cases, HPV may cause cell changes that persist for years, and the cells can eventually become cancerous if not detected in time. However, regular screening (such as Pap tests) can almost always find abnormalities so they can be treated, if needed, before cancer occurs. Some other cancers associated with â€œhigh-riskâ€ HPV include those of the anus, penis, vagina, and vulva. These cancers are not common and are very rare in industrialized nations, however ... Partners who are sexually intimate only with each other are not likely to pass the same virus back and forth. When HPV infection goes away the immune system will remember that HPV type and keep a new infection of the same HPV type from occurring again."" http://www.ashasexualhealth.org/std-sti/hpv/relationships-hpv.html

* About 79 million Americans are currently infected with HPV. About 14 million
people become newly infected each year. HPV is so common that most
sexually-active men and women will get at least one type of HPV at some point
in their lives. http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm

* Combined prevalence of all types of HPV related cancer in men is around 1 in 40000. Prevalence of cervical cancer in women is around 1 in 10000. Compare with some rates of unlikely deaths that normal people never worry about:

> Sun/heat exposure    273     1 in 13,729
> Shark attack*   62  1 in 60,453
> Lightning   47  1 in 79, 746
> Train crash     24  1 in 156,169
> Fireworks   11  1 in 340,733

http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/how-scared-should-we-be/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0

And this compares the rate of *getting* cancer with unlikely deaths. Dying from cervical cancer is much rarer because it's very slow growing and usually caught in time given access to decent medical care.

* In a study with 290 healthy men of ages 18-44 with HPV, at the end of 12 months all of them cleared cancer-causing HPV: ""At 6 months, 44.5%, 41.7%, and 46.5% of subjects remained positive for any HPV, oncogenic HPV, and nononcogenic HPV, respectively, compared with 25.2%, 19.0%, and 29.3% at 12 months and 10.7%, 0%, and 14.4% at 18 months.""  http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/198/6/827.full

* CDC fact sheet for HPV and men: http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv-and-men.htm

* ""Should you stop having sex with your partner if she finds out?
There is no need to stop having sexual contact with your partner if she is
tested for the virus and finds out she has HPV. The virus is commonly exchanged
between sexual partners, and by the time HPV is detected, it most likely
already has been shared between the two of you. And, once a particular type of
the virus has been exchanged, there is little risk of a ""ping-pong"" effect â€“ in
which you and your partner keep re-infecting each other with the same type. (In
other words, you don't need to worry about passing the same type of HPV back
and forth.) However, if you become sexually involved with a different partner,
you may pass any types of HPV that are ""active"" in your body to her, and vice
versa. Remember: HPV is not a sign that you or your partner has been unfaithful. HPV
can be ""silent"" for many years before it is detected by a test. Your partner
may have had the HPV virus for a long time, and there is no way to know when or
from whom she got it.""

* ""Q: What can you do to protect yourself, and your partner?

A: Because HPV is so common, it is difficult to avoid it altogether. It is
reasonable to expect that you will get HPV at some time during your life.
Sexual contact with just one partner can be enough to get or spread the virus."" http://www.thehpvtest.com/about-hpv/faqs-for-men/#Is-there-an-HPV-test-for-men

* Cool post by drpynchon that explains the risk for women and gives some perspective. Quote: ""Unfortunately, there is no doubt that you are at a higher RELATIVE risk of cervical cancer, but your ABSOLUTE risk is still tiny. And it's important that you keep things in perspective. According to a JAMA article from 2007, the overall prevalence of high-risk HPV strains in the US female population is about 15%.1 That's approximately 22.5 MILLION women. On the other hand, in a given year about 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.2 Ignoring the small fraction of cancers unrelated to these strains, that's about 0.05% of women with high-risk strains of HPV per year. Or 1 in 2,000 women with a high-risk strain. And among those women who do get this diagnosis, those who were in your position (knew they had the virus, got the recommended surveillance testing, STOPPED SMOKING) likely had phenomenal odds for early recognition, treatment and cure."" http://ask.metafilter.com/240318/I-have-High-Risk-hpv-What-now

* The ASHA page for HPV is really great. Here is the myths and misconceptions part:
"" Myth: I'm the only person I know with HPV. It's easy to understand why so many people hold this misunderstanding about HPV. After all, public awareness of the virus is extremely low. Most people who contact ASHA with questions about HPV have never even heard of HPV until they were diagnosed. Those struggling with this troubling condition or strange new diagnosis rarely discuss it with others, since it would seem unlikely that they would understand. And others--your second-best friend, your cousin, your coworker, your neighbor across the street--likewise feel constrained to keep silent about their HPV, thinking that you wouldn't understand. The net result is that very few people ever have the chance to place genital HPV in an accurate context, as the very common virus it really is. According to an article published in 1997 in the American Journal of Medicine, about 74 percent of Americans--nearly three out of four--have been infected with genital HPV at some point in their lives. Among those ages 15-49, only one in four Americans has not had a genital HPV infection.""

**How it feels**
==========

The idea that I won some cosmic lottery to be a walking talking cancer vector feels really shitty. It really takes the joy out of you sometimes. I realize now that this description is a bit dramatic, but that's really how I felt at the beginning, and periodically so. You then realize that it does mostly go away and rarely does it cause major problems, but it's really the uncertainty that gets you. When will it go away? Do I still have it? Why does it take so f*king long for it to die? Would anyone even choose to date a person with an STD? What would my friends think? Given the ridiculous misinformation about STDs, would they ostracize me? What did I do to deserve this? (Hint: No one deserves to get an STD, and no one gets one because they deserve it or anything crazy like that.) Is my sex life over? Will I ever find a partner?

Being a nerd who was an introverted late bloomer and who only recently got self confidence, I'm really enjoying the new found attention I'm getting, and it's really a damper when I'm having a great time with a girl and then I get into the attitude of ""oh, but this can't / won't go anywhere"".

I would be absolutely devastated if I knew that I harmed someone, let alone in this way.

[HPV protection] Question about HPV protection for females,2,4ry35u,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/4ry35u/hpv_protection_question_about_hpv_protection_for/,6,1468056141,"I'm a virgin female and have gotten my first two Gardasil doses (out of three).

That is my current worry. Upon more research, I guess men can't test for HPV? So now I'm paranoid about oral sex in particular. Can I easily get the HPV virus? I can't bear to get an STD, let alone cervical cancer. Are two doses of the three vaccines enough?

Background:

1. I've been sexually active for around 12 years, with mostly men and a few women.

2. I ALWAYS use condoms with male partners. I sometimes, but rarely, use gloves/dental dams with female ones.

3. I've never had warts or other visible symptoms of HPV. I don't think I've ever been tested for HPV before, though I get tested regularly for other STIs. So, if I have it now, I have NO IDEA how long ago I was exposed.

4. I got the HPV vaccine several years ago.

5. Last pap, around three years ago, was normal.

6. My understanding is that men can't get tested, so telling them would just be an FYI. It wouldn't prompt them to get tested and wouldn't give them useful information for the future. It would just be an uncomfortable conversation with no upside.

I'm leaning toward not contacting past male partners because of point #6 above. But I would appreciate some outside perspective. Am I off-base? If so, how would you suggest I proceed?"

I'm 22, non smoker and I live a pretty healthy life style. Except for occasional pizzas and hash browns. I just bought my first house and have an incredibly supportive and wonderful boyfriend.

And it looks like my cervical cancer came back. 

I just got 6 biopsies done 10 days ago, and the doctor wants to meet in person to discuss my results. And if it does, I have a high probability of having my cervix, or more, removed.

My boyfriend and I really want kids one day, and while the day isn't any time soon, it's still something we both really want. And while we're both totally on board with adoption, I truly wanted the experience of being pregnant. And having that choice taken away from me... It's just hard to deal with.

I'm a mid twenties male, shes a mid-twenties female. Some history of the relationship might be elucidating:

We started off as friends but both wanted to get physical. I rebuffed her repeatedly as I'd just left another relationship and came away with a case of HPV. I had no intentions of infecting her, and knew I wouldnt be able to live with the guilt if i did. After much dread, I admitted this to her as the reason we couldn't be more than friends. She was touched by my honesty, got the vaccine, and only after that did we start hooking up and dating. Then we moved in together. Fast forward to now.

We've been dating basically 3+ years at this point. She ended up contracting HPV despite the vaccine. We haven't had sex in over a year and a half. She's totally cold to the idea of sex, and, understandably, the entire experience is framed negatively by HPV. Despite receiving the full vaccine before we became physical, she's developed pre-cancerous cells in her uterus and is (rightfully so) pretty traumatized about it.

We still love each other very much. I get the occasion oral sex from her (less frequently now), though she recoils from my touch or any attempts I make to repay the favor. 

I have tried all the things: massages, full-day pampering, making her dinner, cleaning the apartment, love letters, love notes, love poems, surprise gifts, vacations together, and still the sex is nowhere on the horizon. I'm pretty torn about all this. On the one hand I feel sorry for her and guilty about much of this, but on the other hand, I gave her full disclosure before we every touched each other. I love her and I feel guilty about all that, but I just want to have a loving, sexual relationship with her. It has been over a year and half since we had sex. Will this ever get better or am I just prolonging the inevitable?

Of course, this begs the question- doesnâ€™t it make her sexist for believing men shouldnâ€™t be able to address discrimination and legitimate male issues?

Also, read the comments from member marilove- she once stated that â€œsexism against men doesnâ€™t exist, thatâ€™s not how this works.â€ She regularly comments how men donâ€™t need any rights, feminism should control government and politics, and once that â€œa little bit of male discrimination might not be such a bad thing.â€

She is one of rebeccas favorite posters.

I would like to state here that Rebecca Watson is a bigot who supports the legal and social discrimination of males. She supports laws that discriminate against men, and does not believe that legal and social discrimination of males is in any way a negative occurrence.

Theres a very disturbing article about providing the HPV vaccine to 12 year olds in England.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21282382
Notice the language here:
â€œ""Vaccination of boys was not recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation because once 80% coverage among girls has been achieved, there is little benefit in vaccinating boys to prevent cervical cancer in girls.â€

Soâ€¦.they wont vaccinate boys because it doesnâ€™t benefit girls? So boys dying of throat cancer doesnâ€™t matter? The only reason for vaccination is to protect the female life? Does the male life not matter?

In Germany, insurance companies offer the HPV vaccine free for women and girls, but not for anybody born maleâ€¦..doesnt this sound very similar to the reproductive rights discriminations that feminists speak of?

I often read feminists say that the MRA movement is simply a hate movement and that no legitimate discrimination against men exists. They also say that the only way to achieve equality is by more feminism- but how is feminism supposed to address mens issues?


It is NOT equality to force all males into the military for 1-2 years as many countries do (conscription)
It is NOT equality to have different pension and disability ages for men and women, forcing men to retire at an older age even if disables, as many countries do
It is NOT equality to neglect homeless shelters for men even though men constitute over 2/3 of the homeless population in the United States.
It is NOT equality to bar male domestic violence victims from equal government services or to pass â€œmandatory male arrest lawsâ€ where even if a woman attacks her boyfriend and he runs out of the house visibly wounded and calls the police, he is still the one arrested
It is NOT equality to give men longer jail sentences for respective crimes.
It is NOT equality for the U.S federal government to spend 15x more on female-specific medical research on a PER DEATH ratio.
The German constitution states that if a male and female job applicant have equal qualifications, the job should go to the woman. Many countries have similar lawsâ€¦.which are NOT equality!!!
It was NOT equality for U.N relief aid stations to refuse food to single men after the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
It is NOT equality than newborn males have no legal bodily integrity and can legally have 20,000 nerve endings of healthy, specialized sexual tissue ripped, sliced and torn off at birth.
Is it NOT equality for the U.N to focus only on preventing violence against women while ignoring violence against men as unimportant, even tough men are the majority of victims of violence and murder around the world.
It is NOT equality for a certain british company to state that â€œacceptable dress standardsâ€ for male employees include a mandatory suit and tie, yet women are allowed to wear t-shirt and jeans. (Not that this one is particularly important, yet I find it particularly irksome.)

It is NOT equality to have special government programs and services for women that men do not get- why should a middle class women get something a poor, working class man does not?

Most people would save 1 woman before 3 men,116,17qlvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/17qlvu/most_people_would_save_1_woman_before_3_men/,39,1359808722,"In trying to explain and define societal misandry and the ""male unprivileged"" in a broad sense, I try and find one concise fact or analogy  to sum things up, without having to ramble on and on about Norway conscription policy or swiss tax law.

I realized today that the best way to sum up sexism against men in todays culture might in fact be a question.

I decided to take to the streets (and yahoo answers) to test my hypothesis, and needless to say i confirmed what i suspected.

""If 3 men and 1 woman were drowning and you had to choose, would you save the 3 men or 1 woman?""

and yea, you know what the more frequently given answer was.

try it yourself. then knock the 3 men up to 4, then 5, then 10, than 100. see how many it takes.

our culture automatically favors women. subconsciously, people treat women better, even if they are unaware of it.

If its raining and theres only one umbrella, it goes to the woman.
If theres only more chair, its supposed to go to the woman




People always say how its misogynistic to use the words â€œbitchâ€ ad â€œcuntâ€ about womenâ€¦.but what about when said words are directed towards men? By women? And what about all of the male gender-specific terms, lke asshole, prick, douchebag, etc? why donâ€™t people have a problem with these terms?

The answer is simple- because people do not see anything wrong with directing negativity towards males. Degrading and insulting males isnâ€™t seen as a â€œbadâ€ thing. 

Its as if being female gives you an automatic impunity from certain hardships and treatment that men donâ€™t need or deserve.

People hate seeing a woman starving, or in poverty, or struggling. But people couldnâ€™t care less about men in the same situation

we turn our NFL fields pink because breast cancer affects women.

european countries don't give the HPV vaccine to boys to prevent throat cancer because they arent girls and dont mater as much.

routine infant male circumcision is allowed because boys are the only ones affected.

no one points out that having higher retirement ages for men in many european countries violates the European court of justice' ruling against ANY legal disparity between genders because men are the ones with the unfavorable position.

no one asks if forcing all 18 year old boys to join the military for 1-2 years in said european countries might not be espousing of the principles of gender equality, because only boys are affected.

but if you imagine the reverse....

i read a post from a feminist that said ""you do realize that sexism aganst men does NOT exist right? thats not how this works.""

...but what is ""this"", i wonder?


this is what male sexism is...the tendency to ignore, rationalize, justify or fail to even recognize systemic injustice and disparities that affect males.

in most peoples minds, sexism against males just ""doesnt count."" its not that people dont care, its that people's brains literally do not compute the concept of discrimination against men

letting""ladies go first"", or passing a special bill to increase research for heart disease and cancer and women goes uncontested by the general population.

a charity for women or girls would be lauded as a heroic act of human rights and decency.

a charity for men and boys would be a medieval, misogynistic hate project.

our society teaches women=good, men=bad, and im seeing the effects more and more.

how much longer will it be until federal research funding for prostate cancer is cut completely? or when colleges are 75% female? or when all boys have to go through special ""gender sensitivity training"" as children to learn to respect women and girls (without the reciprocal, of course.)

do you trust that social security benefits and health care will be equal for you when you retire? or there at all?

* Higher retirement age, women get to retired earlier, especially if they had children, it will only be equal in 2041.

* Medication coverage, some medication is only covered if you are female, such as HPV vaccine or estradiol

*  Manual work weight limits, women have much lower ones, meaning they can't be force to do harder work.

* Women can leave prison for up to 10 days in a year to visit their child. They can use cosmetics and have no limits for hair.

*  In case of war, women can stay home instead of conscripting, if they care for a child aged 14 and below. Also applies to single fathers.

* Female police officers can't be assigned to riskier tasks.



In the past it was even worse, women were banned from working as a miner, meaning men had to do it, of course this can interpreted as discrimination of women. Until 2001 rape was only recognized as raping a women. Men had to pay more for insurance."
Don't forget the HPV vaccine (and tobacco's not a great idea either),33,48khsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/48khsw/dont_forget_the_hpv_vaccine_and_tobaccos_not_a/,2,1456921326,"So I'm back here and posting, and y'all are one of my major communities.  I think it's time for me to stop worrying about making this perfect and just put it out there as a reminder.

My past few weeks (and months if you count putting up with the symptoms developing before the diagnosis) have been occupied with a close relative coming down with oral cancer.  As if you needed to hear it, oral cancer *really* sucks!  It actually turns out this particular one is most likely from smoking but HPV is now such a common and increasing cause that the referral went to a HPV specialist first.  (Or, look at it this way, it's now *so* common that they put a HPV specialist in charge of admissions for that whole department at the hospital.)

The symptoms are No Fun and the same either way, while HPV adds the opportunity to share the risk with your partner(s), and is also a risk for cervical cancer, so if you've been putting off getting the shot, here's your reminder.  In the US it's recommended and probably covered for females 26 and under, but it protects males too.

If you've already had the vaccine, keep an eye on the news or in touch with your doctor because it seems like there are newer versions coming out which cover additional strains.

...and if you're smoking, as bi folk are also apparently at higher risk for - well, yeah, tobacco's nasty on that front too, do what you can to minimize your exposure.  I've only managed to 'quit' 'over' to e-cigs and fell back on the regular ones for a bit during the stress of all this, but the verdict coming back has been a reason to think thrice about grabbing a real one.  The lucky victim had quit completely for 20 years before it hit - so yeah, try to knock it off before that.

He's in treatment now, the 'drama' phase is hopefully about over with, and fingers are crossed - just take whatever energy you would've spent on sympathy and go out and get the shot or spread the word instead, so maybe at least one other person gets spared this mess."
Why I'm kind of glad I got genital warts,129,1w1n0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1w1n0r/why_im_kind_of_glad_i_got_genital_warts/,13,1390612675,"That might sound weird. But this is something I really want to talk about anonymously, and I adore this community. I'm a 22-year-old female college student who has gotten the Gardasil vaccine.

**How I found out**: Noticed some bumps around my vagina. Put off going to the doctor for months. Was googling ""extreme cases of herpes"" until 3am and getting nightmares, so I decided to just do it. Doctor said I had genital warts caused by HPV.

**My reaction**: Cried. A lot. For two days. Thought that my boyfriend would never want to have sex with me and that my sex life was basically over.

**My friend's reaction**: (When I told her I had HPV) ""LIKE HERPES?!""
(When I told my f-buddy) ""Uhh what is HPV?"" Then was pretty cool about it.

**When I researched HPV**: Almost everyone who is sexually active gets it at some point in their life, and doesn't even know it. Condoms aren't very effective against it. HPV goes away eventually, or lies dormant for the rest of your life. There are no test for men. The type that causes warts is not the same type that causes cervical cancer. It's not a huge deal.

**The warts themselves**: Not even the bumps that I thought they were. Apparently the bumps around my vaginal opening were just.. my vagina! Go figure. The warts themselves are tiny, barely raised, and in the area between my vagina and anus. There are about 8 of them and they just look like little white spots.

**The treatment**: My doc has been doing freezing treatments twice a week. This hurts like hell, but is bearable. I always treat myself to tacos and a margarita afterwards.

**Why I'm kind of glad I got them**: To be honest, I wasn't the guru of safe sex. I would use a condom with random hookups, but not with people I knew. I was a little bit promiscuous, and there's nothing wrong with that, but I was careless about it. This has been a huge wakeup call for me. What if it had been herpes? or HIV? For all the times I've had unprotected sex, it could have been worse. And I'm not taking those chances again.

I also had a long talk with my f-buddy about it. That was the scariest part for me. But it allowed us to have a very open conversation about sex and STDs that we'd never had before. It also made me realize that he is not just an f-buddy. I can't have sex until the warts are gone, but he still invites me to sleepover, or help me with homework, or actually just watch the movie.

I've learned that I have so much value besides my sexual side. It's taken a huge halt in my sex life to make me realize how much it defined me. I'm actually focusing better on other things, and my self-esteem has skyrocketed.

Having genital warts sucks. But it is *not the worst thing that has happened to me*. I'll be glad when this is over, but I plan on taking all of the lessons with me, and hopefully getting other people to educate themselves a little more about it."
Something i realized after my first doctor's appointment,12,2fht6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/2fht6m/something_i_realized_after_my_first_doctors/,12,1409896150,"So i've seen several threads about people going to a doctor and them asking about their sexual preferences or activities. Sometimes during these appointments they say the doctor was either attacking them with the questions or that they simply deflect answering in defense of their trans status being threatened. Where i'm not trying to debate any of these claims, because they're in the right if they feel like they've been attacked, i just thought i'd share some insight for some people who have yet to visit a doctor.


When i went in my doctor asked about my sexual preference, or if i had sex with men or women. Where i started to worry she may be trying to use everything i say against me, i realized that there's underlyign medical concerns from that doctor. Mainly she was making sure i was being safe. She was asking some of these question to actually help make sure i'm informed and keeping myself safe while i transition. Like she explained if i were to have sex with men during my transition to try and use a female condom instead, as a normal condom could get stuck if i'm having anal sex. She also informed me that HPV can lead to prostate cancer, which actually led to me deciding to get the vaccine. 


I guess my point is, pay close attention to tones of what is being said and context. And always answer truthfully, because if something is left out it may cause your transition to either be on hold or to be unsafe in a medical stand point. And again i'm not trying to debate the claims that there are shitty doctors out there with shitty attitudes. I mean hell, my family doctor of 12 years, or however the hell long i've lived in the area, flat out refused to see me.  Just make sure you're medically safe while transitioning and first try and ""play ball"" with the doctor and make sure you know what they are asking these questions for.  

One a side not, for liability reasons i have to see their inhouse therapist, without charge, for one session for them to make sure going forward is ok. He is dedicated to our LGBT clinic with the university and even has student doctor's around to learn more about lgbt issues and how best to help us. I'm super excited and can't wait to blow his mind on how ready i am.

""Dr. Diane Harper was a leading expert responsible for the Phase II and Phase III safety and effectiveness studies which secured the approval of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasilâ„¢ and Cervarixâ„¢.  Dr. Harper also authored many of the published, scholarly papers about the vaccines.  She is now the latest in a long string of experts who are pressing the red alert button on the devastating consequences and irrelevancy of these vaccines.  Dr. Harper made her surprising confession at the 4th International Converence on Vaccination which took place in Reston, Virginia.  Her speech, which was originally intended to promote the benefits of the vaccines, took a 180-degree turn when she chose instead to clean her conscience about the deadly vaccines so she â€œcould sleep at nightâ€.  The following is an excerpt from a story by Sarah Cain:

â€œDr. Harper explained in her presentation that the cervical cancer risk in the U.S. is already extremely low, and that vaccinations are unlikely to have any effect upon the rate of cervical cancer in the United States.  In fact, 70% of all HPV infections resolve themselves without treatment in a year, and the number rises to well over 90% in two years.  Harper also mentioned the safety angle.  All trials of the vaccines were done on children aged 15 and above, despite them currently being marketed for 9-year-olds.  So far, 15,037 girls have reported adverse side effects from Gardasilâ„¢ alone to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), and this number only reflects parents who underwent the hurdles required for reporting adverse reactions.  At the time of writing, 44 girls are officially known to have died from these vaccines.  The reported side effects include Guillian BarrÃ© Syndrome (paralysis lasting for years, or permanently â€” sometimes eventually causing suffocation), lupus, seizures, blood clots, and brain inflammation.  Parents are usually not made aware of these risks.  Dr. Harper, the vaccine developer, claimed that she was speaking out, so that she might finally be able to sleep at night.  â€™About eight in every ten women who have been sexually active will have HPV at some stage of their life,â€™ Harper says.  â€™Normally there are no symptoms, and in 98 per cent of cases it clears itself.  But in those cases where it doesnâ€™t, and isnâ€™t treated, it can lead to pre-cancerous cells which may develop into cervical cancer.â€™â€ 

Although these two vaccines are marketed as protection against cervical cancer, this claim is purely hypothetical.  Studies have proven â€œthere is no demonstrated relationship between the condition being vaccinated for and the rare cancers that the vaccine might prevent, but it is marketed to do that nonetheless.  In fact, there is no actual evidence that the vaccine can prevent any cancer.  From the manufacturers own admissions, the vaccine only works on 4 strains out of 40 for a specific venereal disease that dies on its own in a relatively short period, so the chance of it actually helping an individual is about about the same as the chance of her being struck by a meteorite.â€

UPDATE #1: Since coming forward with the truth about the devastating consequences of the HPV vaccine, Dr. Harper has been victim of a relentless campaign attempting to discredit the validity of her claims.  Harper was even misquoted by British tabloid The Sunday Express which printed a false story loaded with fabricated quotations attributed to Harper.  In an interview with The Guardian, Harper makes it very clear about what exactly she said in order to protect herself from a potential lawsuit.  In an interview with CBS NEWS, Harper clarifies her position, and once again makes it crystal clear just how devastating this vaccine can be: â€œIf we vaccinate 11 year olds and the protection doesnâ€™t last â€¦ weâ€™ve put them at harm from side effects, small but real, for no benefit,â€ says Dr. Harper. â€œThe benefit to public health is nothing, there is no reduction in cervical cancers, they are just postponed, unless the protection lasts for at least 15 years, and over 70% of all sexually active females of all ages are vaccinated.â€  She also says that enough serious side effects have been reported after Gardasil use that the vaccine could prove riskier than the cervical cancer it purports to prevent.  Cervical cancer is usually entirely curable when detected early through normal Pap screenings.

â€œThe risks of serious adverse events including death reported after Gardasil use in (the JAMA article by CDCâ€™s Dr. Barbara Slade) were 3.4/100,000 doses distributed,â€ Harper tells CBS NEWS.  â€The rate of serious adverse events on par with the death rate of cervical cancer.  Gardasil has been associated with at least as many serious adverse events as there are deaths from cervical cancer developing each year.  Indeed, the risks of vaccination are underreported in Sladeâ€™s article, as they are based on a denominator of doses distributed from Merckâ€™s warehouse.  Up to a third of those doses may be in refrigerators waiting to be dispensed as the autumn onslaught of vaccine messages is sent home to parents the first day of school.  Should the denominator in Dr. Sladeâ€™s work be adjusted to account for this, and then divided by three for the number of women who would receive all three doses, the incidence rate of serious adverse events increases up to five fold. How does a parent value that information,â€ said Harper.

â€œParents and women must know that deaths occurred,â€ Harper tells CBS NEWS.  â€œNot all deaths that have been reported were represented in Dr. Sladeâ€™s work, one-third of the death reports were unavailable to the CDC, leaving the parents of the deceased teenagers in despair that the CDC is ignoring the very rare but real occurrences that need not have happened if parents were given information stating that there are real, but small risks of death surrounding the administration of Gardasil.â€  She also worries that Merckâ€™s aggressive marketing of the vaccine may have given women a false sense of security. â€œThe future expectations women hold because they have received free doses of Gardasil purchased by philanthropic foundations, by public health agencies or covered by insurance is the true threat to cervical cancer in the future.  Should women stop Pap screening after vaccination, the cervical cancer rate will actually increase per year. Should women believe this is preventive for all cancers â€” something never stated, but often inferred by many in the population â€” a reduction in all health care will compound our current health crisis.  Should Gardasil not be effective for more than 15 years, the most costly public health experiment in cancer control will have failed miserably.â€  Harper notes that her concern for the vaccineâ€™s deadly side effects applies only to women in the Western world.  â€Of course, in developing countries where there is no safety Pap screening for women repeatedly over their lifetimes, the risks of serious adverse events may be acceptable as the incidence rate of cervical cancer is five to 12 times higher than in the US, dwarfing the risk of death reported after Gardasil.â€

UPDATE #2: The National Vaccine Information Center HAS CONFIRMED two virologists, Stephen Krahling and Joan Wlochowski have filed a lawsuit against their former employer and vaccine manufacturer Merck.  NVIC writes: â€œThe lawsuit alleges that Merck defrauded the U.S. for over 10 years by overstating the MMR vaccineâ€™s effectivenes.  The virologists claim in their lawsuit that they â€˜Witnessed firsthand the improper testing and data falseification in which Merck engaged to artificially inflate the vaccineâ€™s efficacy findings.â€  NVIC president and co-founder, Barbara Loe Fisher, warns of the disturbingly cozy relationship and overwhelming conflict of interest between federal agencies charged with vaccine safety oversight (such as the Centers for Disease Control) and vaccine manufacturers.  Merckâ€™s global vaccine sales total more than $20 BILLION A YEAR.

As the worldâ€™s pharmaceutical giants continue to be driven less by moral accountability and more by profit and shareholder-driven bottom lines, we are going to see more and more products such as this vaccine which are marketed as â€œessential to oneâ€™s survival.â€  While some vaccines are indeed essential, such as vaccines for polio and measles, the HPV vaccine is a new beast entirely.  To learn more about how pharmaceutical giants are putting profits ahead of ethics you need to watch FRONTLINEâ€™s terrifying new documentary â€œHunting The Nightmare Bacteria.â€

First ever experience and really worried/scared.,6,1vfvg6,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/1vfvg6/first_ever_experience_and_really_worriedscared/,17,1389987929,"From browsing, I feel like these questions come up all the time but I wanted to submit my own to try to give myself some peace of mind.

I've only ever been into girls but recently decided it would be interesting to try something else. I can't ever imagine myself in a relationship with a guy but the thought of getting physical intrigued me. Not really knowing anyone or where to start, I downloaded Grindr a few days ago. I've been talking with some guys and one guy and I in particular hit it off pretty well. Decided to hang out last night and it turned into messing around. Being uninterested in anything romantic, we didn't kiss. Just jerked each other off. In retrospect I was NOT ready for what came next - emotionally or mentally - but he gave me a blowjob and fingered me using his saliva as a lubricant. I also ended up getting a decent bit of his cum on my hands.

Not only did the experience bring me to the realization that I'm not as interested in guys as I previously thought, but now I'm terrified I might have caught something. I talked with him before and even messaged him afterwards to let him know I was freaked out. He assured me he was clean and told me he gets regularly tested, the last test having been last Wednesday (about a week ago). He says he hasn't had any sex since then and told me the last time he had before the test was in early December.

He seems pretty cool and felt bad that I'd had a not so good experience. He told me he thought I was a cool guy and that even if I wasn't interested in fooling around, he'd like to stay friends. I'm inclined to think that I'll be fine but as a naturally anxious person I'm still unable to calm down. I feel so ridiculously stupid and wreckless.

I was hoping I could get some advice. I know I'll want to get myself tested but have no idea how or where to get it done and how long I'll have to wait to know 100% if I have anything. I live on campus at my university and the clinic probably offers tests. I understand insurance often covers these costs but as I've never been romantically interested in a guy, I've never discussed my curiousity with my family and simply can't have it showing up on records - neither party is even close to ready for that discussion. I was also hoping I could get some information on what kind of STIs/Ds I should be worried about. I've gotten the first injection for my HPV vaccine so I'd guess my risk is lower. I know without cuts on my penis HIV would be pretty improbable but the fingering with saliva worries me. I'm also worried about herpes or some other incurable disease (although the thought of having anything at all scared the absolute shit out of me).

I'm sorry for all the text but could really use some advice. I'm away from home for school and can't visit my doctor for any information.

Thanks, Reddit.
I'm sorry if I'm overreacting, I really am just terrified.

Edit: Thanks for the replies. I really do appreciate it. I didn't mean to insinuate or come off as thinking the gay community carries more diseases, just that hookup apps/sites are probably less safe than encounters that arise from getting to know someone as a friend/romantic interest before getting sexual - male or female.

Any ideas of where I could go for a decent/thorough/cheap screening?"
How can I be an ally?,25,1uf7yr,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1uf7yr/how_can_i_be_an_ally/,9,1388906318,"I used a throwaway account because everyone knows my main account and I don't want them to come across this post.



I am a cishet Arab female from an Arab country. Things are very different in my country than in the US and Canada etc.


I am studying abroad in the UK, and I have received a lot of training on sensitivity and active listening, and how to deal with people coming out or telling you they have problems with their sexual identity. I am also very good friends with a few gay, bisexual, and pansexual people here in the UK. Because of my friendships and my volunteer work, my male best friends from home have come out to me as gay. Several acquaintances that I've only spoken to a few times have come out to me as gay because they see that I am good friends with gay people here in the UK, which shows that they are very desperate for support!


How can I help them?


I know in other countries, you have LGBT+ icons and spokespersons who can stand up and fight for LGBT+ rights. In my country, this is not possible. My friends would be disowned if they came out. They would be social pariahs. It is still considered a mental disorder here!!! One of them wants to get the HPV vaccine but is too afraid (even the medics cannot be trusted to keep their mouth shut!!)



They hate themselves for being gay. One of them is very religious and has serious problems accepting his sexuality because of it. What can I do to help them?


I read some of the posts on this sub and a lot of them have to do with gay marriage..we are a long, long way from that, and I don't think we will get there any time soon.


What are some resources that can help me?


I want to change my community. I can do this because I am straight. My gay friends are too scared to speak up (and rightly so). But I am straight and my heterosexuality protects me from any bullying or harassment. So far, I have been posting photos and articles on Facebook that show that I am very LGBT+ friendly. Because of this, some of the people that I know from home came out to me. What more can I do to help?"
Circumcision isn't the villain that r/atheism thinks it is.,0,vr5jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vr5jf/circumcision_isnt_the_villain_that_ratheism/,138,1340937924,"Is r/atheism the bastion of rationality it thinks it is? Here's some counterweight to the polemics against medical circumcision we've seen recently.

First, let's start out with the patently bad arguments on both sides.

Patently bad arguments **in favor** of circumcision:

 * I'm cut and I don't remember it and don't mind it now. (Anecdotes are not data)
 * God commands it.
 * Women prefer it this way. (This would probably be equally likely for an intact person in an area with low circ. rates)
 * I want my son to look like me.

Patently bad arguments **against** circumcision:

 * It's unnatural. ([naturalistic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy)) 
 * It's the same as female genital mutilation. (where the clitoris is removed)
 * It started as a religious tradition, therefore it's *inherently* bad. (Wrong and irrelevant from a medical point of view)


Those out of the way, let's look at some of the medical benefits of circumcision. 

There is **extremely strong** medical evidence that **circumcision reduces HIV transmission**; so much, in fact, that the randomized controlled trials in Africa were stopped early because it was so efficacious. (Long term follow-up [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210632)).

There are several attacks to this result. (Note the trend of attacking the results you don't want.) First, people attempted to discredit the methods or call into question the validity of the studies. This is unconvincing; there were three separate RCTs and a plethora of observational data. The evidence is overwhelming. 

Second, people have argued that safe sex (eg - condom use, education) is more effective. This is not disputed; however, the studies' results were **with education on sex and condom use for all participants**. Additionally, this is akin to arguing that condoms shouldn't be used because abstinence-only education is 'more effective' in preventing HIV spread. Circumcision is cheap, permanent, and effective in preventing the spread of HIV, and the WHO [currently recommends](http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/MCrecommendations_en.pdf) it as a tool to combat the AIDS epidemic in Africa. 

Finally, it's argued that this result can't be extrapolated to places where HIV is not endemic. Well, that very question was addressed in this [recent paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008723), which concluded that circumcision was likely cost-saving (and life saving) when applied to *only HIV transmission* in the United States. The paper does not take complications of circumcision into account, though they're unlikely to change the result. 

**Also, this makes no mention of the other benefits, like [reduced HPV transmission](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3119044/), lower [assorted STD rates](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16581731), reduced [penile cancer rates](http://www.springerlink.com/content/t38q2m0679375653/), and potentially [reduced prostate cancer rates](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.26653/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&userIsAuthenticated=false).**

The obvious rebuttal is that this makes no mention of the drawbacks of the procedure. A common argument is that 'we should cut off the breasts of women to prevent breast cancer'. This, too, is unconvincing. First, there are situations where mastectomy is medically indicated for prophylactic purposes. Second, the breasts have significant demonstrable positive health effects for newborns. Finally, the mastectomy procedure is much riskier than circumcision and requires a much longer recovery period. 

So what are the drawbacks? It's claimed that it has significant sexual effects, but there is [little medical evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_effects_of_circumcision) for that claim, with an equal amount of evidence for the contrary. Opponents cite figures like 'half the sensory nerves are lost,' but again, without evidence of **actual effects**, this is irrelevant. 

It's also claimed that there are significant psychological side effects, but again, [there is no medical evidence of long-term adverse effects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10930942).

There is also the potential for complications from the surgery itself. These are generally considered extremely low (~0.2%) and most studies find that the short-term risk/benefit equation is fairly balanced considering the positive effects circumcision has on prevention of UTIs, phimosis, epididymitis, balanitis, etc. See, for example, [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1794670). Note that this analysis, and several others were done before the effects on HIV/HPV transmission were known.

Another common argument against circumcision is that it should be left up to the child to decide when he comes 'of age'. However, this has some fatal flaws. 

First, most of the protective benefit comes with sexual activity, so the procedure should be done by age 11 or so (as with the HPV vaccine). Children that age are not capable of giving informed consent. 

Second, it's [much more costly](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469634) to circumcise post-neonatal infants. Ten times, in fact.

Third, childhood amnesia prevents the memory of the procedure's pain for neonates. This is not the case in children or adults, who will most likely carry painful memories through the rest of their lives. 

An apt comparison can be drawn with vaccination. In fact, circumcision could be called a 'physical vaccine.' All vaccines come with risks and benefits, including initial pain with administration, severe complications, and even death. There is a 'tipping point' for any vaccine that makes it 'worth it'. There is mounting evidence that *routine medical infant circumcision* has more positives than negatives. **It has undeniably saved thousands of lives**.

Anti-circumcision activists may also point out that the AAP's policy (along with several other countries medical associations) is that there is no medical reason for circumcision. I would like to point out that this policy was enacted in 1999, well before this new data on HIV, HSV, and prostate cancer risk was available. 

Even if you're unconvinced that circumcision is a 'good thing', you must admit that there is a tipping point where you'd support its routine administration. If not, you're guilty of ignoring evidence and clinging to dogma. Who do we know does that?"
The Closet and HPV Vaccine,3,250xi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/250xi1/the_closet_and_hpv_vaccine/,16,1399564234,"I guess I am looking for advice as well as to get this off my chest and come to terms with my emotions.

Just recently I came across a few sources suggesting that young men, such as myself (19 years old), should probably receive an HPV vaccination. Being somewhat of a paranoid STI-phobic person, I feel as if getting the vaccine will put me at ease. I have only had one sexual experience, which involved someone a bit older than myself, was strictly oral, and was a couple months ago.

So, today, my stress has reached a high point. This morning I visited the doctor's office to get a yearly check-up and some blood work done. During my appointment I asked for my immunization record. I just assumed that it would show whether or not I had be vaccinated for HPV. Well, it didn't. I wish I would have spoken up to my doctor about it. Argh! For some reason, I am assuming that I have not received the HPV vaccine since it is mostly targeted at the female population. Can you get your blood drawn and be vaccinated in the same day?

Anyways, now I am conflicted. I would like to be vaccinated, but I'm not out to my parents, or anybody for the matter. While I am not opposed to the idea of coming out to my parents, I'm not sure I want to at the moment. I don't think my parents would react adversely if I told them, but I know the gay label and all the bullshit that comes along with it would be practically tattooed on me. My original plans entailed coming out when I was truly sexually active.

I can't help but wonder if I was just scared to ask my doctor today. Had my doctor asked me, ""are you hetero, bi, or homosexual?"" as one of the standard questions, I would have mentioned that I am gay. But I have never actually told someone *by my own will*, ""I am gay,"" so maybe that is what held me back. The realities of just how difficult coming out can be hit me hard to day, really hard.

Getting back to the point, being that my parents manages my medical visits, what would you guys recommend I do to get vaccinated? I feel as if I have only three options:

* Wait another year to visit the doctor's office, with some testicles this time. **Con**: Closer to age cutoff.
* Come out to my parents. Explain why I want an HPV vaccine. **Con**: Am I ready to come out yet?
* Call for an appointment. **Con**: Will probably show up on the insurance record.

I'm all ears, just hold my hand as you tell me :/

**TLDR: I want to be vaccinated for HPV, but feel as if I have to come out of the closet. Not sure I want to come out yet...**"
"I'm fairly certain I have HPV, is it too late to get the vaccination?",2,2wkctt,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2wkctt/im_fairly_certain_i_have_hpv_is_it_too_late_to/,8,1424481350,"I am a 27 year old male in a relationship with a 23 year old female that's been going on for a year and a half. My girlfriend has HPV, we've known about this for the last year. I'm almost positive I gave it to her, seeing as I had a very promiscuous past before her. I used protection for intercourse 90% of the time with all my partners, but never for oral sex.

My girlfriend and I got into the conversation of vaccines. I came to find out she doesn't trust vaccines. This raised a bit of a red flag. She doesn't have the HPV vaccine and neither do I (I believe).

Sorry if this is a dumb question but considering I already have HPV, is it too late to get vaccinated? And if not, where can I go about getting the vaccine? "
PSA: I Got the Gardasil Vaccine and Still Got HPV,6,1ak6bt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1ak6bt/psa_i_got_the_gardasil_vaccine_and_still_got_hpv/,18,1363681071,"Hi guys, I thought it would be helpful to share my experience since it's a relevant topic for everyone, but women especially.

I was vaccinated with the Gardasil vaccine when I was a teenager and understood it as a prevention against cervical cancer and HPV (a bit naive, but that's how it was explained to me as a young'un). Today, as a 22 year old, I just found out from my gynecologist that I have HPV. Fortunately, it's almost positively the mild strain that will not result in cervical cancer; it just clears up on it's own in a year's time (phew!). BUT, I was still a little flabbergasted that I could get HPV even with the full rounds of immunization I had as a teen. 

Here's how this all works as I understand it now, and a friendly reminder for all the sexually-active folks out there:

* Gardasil works to prevent the *serious* types of HPV that can turn into cervical cancer; it does **not** protect you from any and all types of HPV.
*It is impossible to test for the presence of HPV in males, therefore you can't know who gave it to you or when.

* While it is unlikely that you will pass it onto other females (the most common way to transfer is ""old-fashioned coitus"" as my gynecologist put it), it is still a risk nonetheless.

* According to the CDC, HPV is the most common STD and most sexually active males and females will get it at some point in their lives.

This means that Pap smears are REALLY important! If you are sexually active, get one done every year, for real. Had I followed one nurse's recent advice to only go once every two or three years (check to see if your doctor's office is switching to this policy), I would not have known.

Another note: since guys do not present symptoms, they may check out as STD-free, even on paper. This means that if you are in a monogamous relationship and are using other forms of birth control besides condoms (because that tends to happen in long-term relationships), you might still end up with HPV.

So ladies (and gents), be safe out there! Wrap it up and Pap it up, y'all."

Throughout my search it was clear that the information I collected should be a thread of its own. My knowledge on vaccines was enough to make me doubt them but not in-depth enough. Before I started little did I know how many shocking facts i would come across. Now I am convinced more than ever that people should be aware, very aware and think before they act.

I spent a long time trying to link legitimate online resources. I encourage everyone to try and link the situation by themselves as well. Knowledge is the path to freedom, playing safe with our genetics is the path to our future. Anyone who wants to read this please prepare yourself with time and patience to go through the resources.

1st Step, Find vaccines content:

First of all I looked up the content for the vaccines they wanted to inject my newborn with, I already had the content for them in paper from a European country.  One of them was a live strain vaccine, I refused immediately because I don't agree with a newborn to be injected with a live strain in the first 24 hours of his life. 
I was very surprised to only find information statements on American vaccines that did not contain any details about the content of the vaccines (example: * http://www.immunize.org/vis/dtap.pdf). I personally think this should be illegal.

After some research I managed to find contents, although they differ for each producer, some things remain the same. I will start with the facts that were most shocking to me.
 - Hepatitis B vaccine: a few types of vaccines are on the market, but their content doesn't differ much. They wanted to inject my newborn on the 3rd day with one.

Fendrix Hepatitis B vaccine:

* http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/document.aspx?documentid=16906&docType=SPC#COMPOSITION

""1 dose (0.5 ml) contains:

1 adjuvanted by AS04C containing:
- 3-O-desacyl-4'- monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) 2	50 micrograms

2 adsorbed on aluminium phosphate (0.5 milligrams Al3+ in total)

3 produced in yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology.

For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1""
""6.1 Sodium chloride
Water for injections ""

What is ""produced by recombinant DNA technology"":

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recombinant_DNA_Vaccine -> method also used in HPV vaccine

* http://www.vaccines.gov/more_info/types#recombinant -> method also used in MMR vaccine

That led me to another thought - hey as far as I know vaccines contain traces from animals DNA. What I thought was going on is that they use some animal cells, often monkeys,do their genetic manipulations, insert genes, and purify the DNA they work with trying to eradicate bacteria and other viruses. Well, I was partly right. I will get to this later. So what about the monkey/animal DNA they use to grow the vaccine virus?

""WI-38
WI are the initials for Wistar Institute of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  The number (38) signifies the number of aborted fetuses Dr. Leonard Hayflick dissected before he successfully developed the cell line from the lung tissue of an aborted female baby of three months.  Dr. Hayflick published his work in the medical journal, Experimental Cell Research.  Hayflick disclosed in this publication that three separate cell lines had been developed from aborted babies.  Included with the WI-38 were the WI-26 and the WI-44.

MRC-5
This cell line was developed from the culturing of normal lung tissue of a 14 week old fetus.  J. P. Jacobs published his work on MRC-5 in September 1966 (Nature 227: 168-170, 1970),

Where is the moral in this? My personal morals tell me that killing a growing child and injecting it in one's body is sick.
Injecting vaccines that contain DNA from animals or other humans can have lasting effect on the genetics, not only in my generation, in generations to come. Injected at the earliest development of a child! 


Let's move on to some other ingredients:

Monosodium Glutamate - neurotoxic - keep in mind we are talking about injecting it into this little new born baby:

Thimerosal

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F__NIq35Ul4 - 
Congressman Dan Burton Grills FDA Representative Over Mercury In Vaccines Issue

Most vaccines no longer have Thimerosal in their list of ingredients, however it is still used during the production process and removed after or some vaccines contain traces of it still.

* http://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vaccine-ingredients Contains a description of vaccine ingredients.

I will stop here because a thick book can be written on the matter. I will leave any further research to each individual.
I want to simply note, autism and cancer numbers rise yearly. Leukemia is huge in England - England promotes high vaccine usage. 
There is no official explanation why that happens, scientists cannot state with certainty that vaccines are not connected with the matter.
My own brother now suffers from leukemia with Philadelphia chromosome, which is genetically inherited, and still my family is asking how come, when there is no history in my family for such diseases?

I would like to conclude that I personally believe vaccines are still an experiment, trial and error procedure. Although I wish my children to be safe from polio and many other diseases, I don't believe vaccines are the way to their safety, on the contrary, my opinion is that they impose much higher long term dangers than benefits.

I believe everyone should be aware not only of the benefits but also of the dangers and no-one should be misled or forced as it is currently happening throughout the world.

PSA: I Got the Gardasil Vaccine and Still Got HPV (Crosspost from r/TwoXChromosomes),18,1ak6l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/1ak6l5/psa_i_got_the_gardasil_vaccine_and_still_got_hpv/,8,1363681248,"Hi guys, I thought it would be helpful to share my experience since it's a relevant topic for everyone, but women especially.

I was vaccinated with the Gardasil vaccine when I was a teenager and understood it as a prevention against cervical cancer and HPV (a bit naive, but that's how it was explained to me as a young'un). Today, as a 22 year old, I just found out from my gynecologist that I have HPV. Fortunately, it's almost positively the mild strain that will not result in cervical cancer; it just clears up on it's own in a year's time (phew!). BUT, I was still a little flabbergasted that I could get HPV even with the full rounds of immunization I had as a teen. 

Here's how this all works as I understand it now, and a friendly reminder for all the sexually-active folks out there:

* Gardasil works to prevent the *serious* types of HPV that can turn into cervical cancer; it does **not** protect you from any and all types of HPV.

* It is impossible to test for the presence of HPV in males, therefore you can't know who gave it to you or when.

* While it is unlikely that you will pass it onto other females (the most common way to transfer is ""old-fashioned coitus"" as my gynecologist put it), it is still a risk nonetheless.

* According to the CDC, HPV is the most common STD and most sexually active males and females will get it at some point in their lives.

This means that Pap smears are REALLY important! If you are sexually active, get one done every year, for real. Had I followed one nurse's recent advice to only go once every two or three years (check to see if your doctor's office is switching to this policy), I would not have known.

Another note: since guys do not present symptoms, they may check out as STD-free, even on paper. This means that if you are in a monogamous relationship and are using other forms of birth control besides condoms (because that tends to happen in long-term relationships), you might still end up with HPV.

So ladies (and gents), be safe out there! Wrap it up and Pap it up, y'all."

Treating depression may reduce heart disease risk

Heart disease and depression are both serious and prevalent conditions; mounting evidence infers that they are connected.Depression and cardiac risk


Researcher Heidi May, PhD, a cardiovascular epidemiologist, wanted to examine whether treating depression reduces the chances of developing heart disease.Treating depression reduces cardiac risk


The results showed that individuals who were no longer depressed had similar rates of heart disease as those who had never been depressed (4.6% and 4.8%, respectively).



In other words, treatment for depression resulted in a decreased level of cardiovascular risk that was roughly equivalent to someone who did not have depression.


Past research has shown that depression increases the chances of cardiovascular health issues in the long-term but, as May explains, ""knowing that alleviating the symptoms of depression reduces a person's risk of heart disease in the short term, too, can help care providers and patients commit more fully to treating the symptoms of depression.""She notes that the results of the current study are observational, and full clinical trials will be necessary to investigate the interplay between depression and heart disease further.Written by Tim Newman

New HPV vaccine could curb cervical cancers and health costs if adopted widely.

McDonnell Foundation, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research."

male with HPV?,3,1xkf4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/mcgill/comments/1xkf4t/male_with_hpv/,11,1392107168,"Hi, 

I'm writing an article about male vaccination for HPV, and was wondering if anyone at McGill (or outside) who has developed genital warts/cancer, or who proactively sought the vaccine themselves, might be willing to speak to me?

I'm mainly wondering how people feel about the gender-based (as opposed to population-based) sponsoring by the Quebec government of the female vaccination, but not male? 

We can arrange to meet elsewhere, or you can comment here.

How do you deal with boundary violations? [CAW],4,1s1g93,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1s1g93/how_do_you_deal_with_boundary_violations_caw/,10,1386148435,"**Some background:**
I work as a math tutor at a University.  I'm a short girl with long hair and big boobs.  I suffered sexual/physical/emotional abuse as a kid, and a large part of that involved someone grabbing my hair and using it as a handle before abusing me.  Anyone grabbing my hair from behind or cornering me tends to make me feel really uncomfortable.  Standing up for myself is really hard because as a kid it would get me injured.  I know the vast majority of people mean well and I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.  

**Messing with my hair**
When I'm at work helping someone, a couple of times a week someone (always female) will come up behind me and start playing with my hair.  This is usually someone I've never met before.  I'm helping someone with a math problem and suddenly something is pulling at my hair painfully.  I turn around and it pulls it even further.  Usually the woman will say, ""I looove your hair."" and continue playing with it.  I usually pull my hair out of their hands.  If I don't say anything they will usually reach for my hair again and try to braid it.  If I say, ""Please don't."" or ""I don't like my hair played with."" they get offended and tell me that everyone likes their hair played with and they were just being nice, then they try to grab my hair again.  

This also happens when I'm anywhere in public, specifically in Trader Joe's for some reason.  My friends also do this.  Usually from behind (because when I see someone approaching from the front I can move out of the way and avoid them).  I usually explain to my friends how it's an abuse trigger and to please not do it.  They usually say, ""But I *like* playing with hair."" or try to make me feel bad for not liking my hair played with and they don't stop.  Some people have started saying, ""I know you hate this, but I looove your hair."" as they grab it.  I've had to have serious talks with them and some people I just can't be around because they won't stop.  

One thing that seems to help a little is wearing my hair in a braid and keeping it inside my shirt.  This keeps the casual strangers off my hair, but friends will often try to get it out of my shirt and unbraided.  When I was going through my punk phase I kept bits of sharpened metal braided into my hair so people grabbing it would hurt their hands.  

**Touching my boobs or ass**
This is usually from my straight female friends.  The boobs don't bother me as much because I can see it coming and avoid it or brace myself mentally.  Certain friends will grab everyone's asses.  I talked to them on several occasions and asked them to stop but they say, ""I just like grabbing asses!"" or ""I'm not into girls so it doesn't count.""  One of these friends identifies as genderqueer (still uses female pronouns though) and I explained to her that if a man grabbed my ass I would be offended, and I'm not going to treat her any differently.  

**Stalking**
I also have a possible stalker.  He used to volunteer at my work but was fired for creepy behavior.  I kept my boss informed and she's had many talks with him about his behavior.  I'm not sure exactly what's wrong with him.  He might be borderline autistic.  His hands are covered with what look exactly like HPV warts and he scratches and picks and chews at them and pulls off scabs to chew on then spits them out and puts the scabs in his pockets.  Also he's constantly trying to touch me and my stuff.  I'm a bit paranoid because I never got the HPV vaccine and if I get it on my hands my sex life as a lesbian would suck, plus the increased risk of cancer.  It's possible he has something non-contagious, but it freaks me out.  

Whenever I have something in my hand, he tries to take it from me and stick it in his pockets.  He's also surprisingly fast.  I've lost several pens and lunches because I was too creeped out to want them back.  The other day I was eating goldfish crackers (because I slept too late to pack a real lunch) and he grabs the bag, sticks both hands in, and says, ""I love goldfish, can I have some?"" I say, ""I guess?"" so he takes almost all the goldfish, puts them in his pockets, licks his hands, then sticks them back in the bag to grab the rest.  Then he sat down really close to me and kept inching close and leaning on me.  I got up and walked away.  

Even though he doesn't work there anymore, he's still there around 6-8 hours a day as a student.  He follows me around most of the time.  I tell him to stop.  The boss tells him to stop.  He asks me for math help but I keep telling him that I don't tutor the math he's in and to ask a different tutor but he insists that he wants my help and that we can figure out the problem together.  The boss has told him to stop asking me for help and go sit in the other room.  It kills me, but I'm actually rude to him to try to get him to leave me alone.  It works about half the time.  

At some point he got my cell number and started calling me a bunch, breathing and saying weird things. The boss told him it was inappropriate and at least he stopped doing that.

**Mansplaining**
One of the Math professors at the school used to be a friend of mine.  We played D&D and other games but I stopped hanging out with him because he's a super competitive douchebag and a serious creeper around women.  Lately, any time I sit down somewhere he moves all his stuff to sit right next to me.  He then listens as I tutor people and frequently interrupts, ""YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG!  I'LL SHOW YOU HOW TO DO IT THE RIGHT WAY!""  which is funny because he's almost always wrong and the student gets creeped out and mentions it to me after.  He also just sits inches away from me and stares at me or my computer screen without saying anything.  

**tl;dr People touch me and I want to make them stop without hurting anyone's feelings.**

Question about Gardasil HPV vaccine. why isn't it approved for people above 26?,1,2ap95j,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/2ap95j/question_about_gardasil_hpv_vaccine_why_isnt_it/,12,1405400277,"how can i get this damn vaccine?  i went to the doctor and the doctor wouldn't prescribe it since i am over 26. and its not recommended by the fda for people over 26.


i would think that if it's inconclusive, then why not get it. but my doctor said they wouldn't prescribe something that hasn't been shown to be effective. 

i still want to get it, despite it not being shown to be effective. it seems pretty irrational that if you are 27 and the cutoff is 26 then all of a sudden it doesnt work. i think that it doesn work, but it hasnt been shown to work. 

According to the cdc website:

>Why aren't HPV vaccines recommended for people older than 26?
Both vaccines were studied in thousands of people from 9 through 26 years old and found to be safe and effective for these ages. The vaccine is not licensed in the United States for persons over age 26 years, as GARDASIL has not been demonstrated to prevent HPV-related outcomes in a general population of women and men older than 26 years of age.


>Why is HPV vaccination only recommended through age 26?
HPV vaccines are licensed for females and males through age 26 years.  Vaccination would have the greatest benefit when administered to girls and boys, aged 11 or 12 years.
As in trials in younger women, a clinical trial of quadrivalent vaccine in women >26 years found the vaccine to be safe. This study also showed that the vaccine was effective in women without evidence of existing or past infection with HPV vaccine types. However, the study demonstrated limited or no protection against disease in the overall study population. Neither vaccine is licensed in the United States for use in women over the age of 26 years.  Although women over age 26 years are not recommended to receive HPV vaccination, they should have cervical cancer screening as currently recommended.

it appears that the studies haven't been on people above 26. so it's not clear whether it's effective or not. is this true? is it not effective for people over 26, or has it just not been shown to be effective and thus it's not clear whether it's effective or not.

>Grand Total HPV Vaccine only Problems reported in the CDC database: *38,217 in less than 10 years!*

>However, *that striking number does not represent the exact number of HPV harms* since the CDC admits that VAERS reports actually represent 10 percent, or less, of all vaccine adverse reactions/harms.

>If that be the case, then there is a possibility that as many as 382,170 females could be harmed from the HPV vaccines.

>The above data come from reports made to the [CDCâ€™s Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/data/index), not some fictitious public relations agenda. 

>Those HPV-vaccine-induced harms are verifiable as being submitted on behalf of individuals who have been harmed by a corporate manufacturerâ€™s product for which pharmaceutical corporations have no legal liability for damages caused.

>Even former FDA Commissioner David Kessler, MD, wrote an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) June 2, 1993,vol.269, No.21, p.2785, wherein he stated the incredibly sad facts about how few adverse event reports actually are made: â€œonly about 1% of serious adverse events are reported to the FDA.â€ 

>It seems that MDs and healthcare professionals, who should know better, are the worst offenders at not reporting vaccine adverse events. Based upon Kesslerâ€™s admission, could the realâ€”or closer to factualâ€”HPV vaccine adverse reactions be 382,170?

>Physicians apparent lack of professionalism regarding reporting adverse vaccine events may stem from their dogmatic beliefs that any reaction patients experience from vaccines only are â€œcoincidences.â€ 

>[This graph](https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/gold-mine-or-dumpster-dive-a-closer-look-at-adverse-event-reports/) shows just how negligent the medical profession is in reporting pharmaceutical, including vaccine, adverse reactions. 

>Can that be considered â€œmedical malpracticeâ€? Why is adverse event reporting not mandated under law for the medical profession just like vaccines are mandated for people to receive them?

â€œThe blue bars are direct reports, submitted by health professionals or the public â€” about 4% of the total submitted in 2010. The remainder are submitted by manufacturers.â€

>Can you imagine any other manufacturer getting away with such product liability malfeasance like vaccine makers do? 

>The word malfeasance is a legal term applying to public officialsâ€™ culpability. The U.S. Congress is to blame for giving vaccine manufacturers a â€œGet out of Jail FREEâ€ card on vaccine product liability.

>And yet, no one wants to correct that gravely flawed â€œno-fault-vaccine-liabilityâ€ gift-program the U.S. Congress gave to Big Pharma and vaccine manufacturers!

>Is there any wonder why the public is overly concerned about and refusing to get vaccines? Rightfully so! Take a perfectly healthy child to get shot up with up to nine vaccines at one doctorâ€™s visit and the kid never is the same afterward. 

>Who, in their right mind, except Big Pharma executives and their medical acolytes, wouldnâ€™t question, be scared, or refuse to have their child damaged for life? There ought to be a law against damaging a child with vaccines! VAERS proves it happens more than we know! 

>Kids arenâ€™t the only ones; adults experience vaccine damage, e.g., [Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS).](http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/vaccine/guillainbarre.htm)

>Since the U.S. Congress, federal and state health agencies are doing nothing to investigate the problems with vaccines and their toxic ingredients; are kowtowing to pseudo-science or what more realistically is â€œconsensus scienceâ€; [and introducing/passing oppressive resolutions](http://www.activistpost.com/2015/04/the-us-congress-is-out-to-lunch-about.html) advocating increased vaccine schedules, concerned citizens have taken it upon themselves to expose the criminal activities going on in the name of medical science. 

>The HPV vaccines are the perfect â€˜poster childâ€™ for that, since those vaccines account for a good number of the VAERS reports being made.

>However, in countries other than the USA, there are totally different tactics being taken by national governments, even to suing vaccine makers and stopping vaccination programs. Here are some examples:

[The Colombian Controversy Continues](http://sanevax.org/hpv-vaccines-colombian-controversy-continues/)

[UK: Parliamentary meeting of families with girls injured by HPV vaccines](http://sanevax.org/uk-parliamentary-meeting-families-girls-injured-hpv-vaccines/)

>I think readers can get an idea that there is world-wide concern, plus legal actions instituted against the HPV vaccine manufacturers, but nothing is done in the USA where there is the most damage confirmed as per the CDC VAERS reports!

>Furthermore, the U.S. media actively refuses to report vaccine â€˜politicsâ€™ in other countries. Why? For more information about HPV vaccine issues in other countries, readers may want to look through SaneVaxâ€™s Press Releases [here.](http://sanevax.org/media-about/sanevax-press-releases/)

>The most amazing and admirable mission of SaneVax is its presence in countries around the globe, as stated in SaneVax: [Who we are, What we do, Why we do:](http://sanevax.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/SaneVax-who-we-are.pdf)

""SANEVAX has an international presence in the countries of Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Japan, Finland, France, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Peru, Russia, Spain, South Africa, Sweden, Zambia, United Kingdom, and United States of America. We are known in 157 countries around the world.""

>SaneVax has been instrumental in helping injured HPV vaccinees attain justice in their respective countryâ€™s legal system.

""In November 2014, a 15 year-old survivor of HPV vaccination, living in El Carmen de Bolivar, Colombia, became the recipient of the first judgment issued by any High Court in the country in a case regarding complications occurring after HPV vaccination. In this landmark decision the court ruled that the fundamental rights of this girl and her newborn daughter must be protected by Colombian health authorities.""

>One has to question why is there such a total disconnect between legal systems in the USA and other countries? 

>The problem in the USA is Congress and the lobbying system that makes â€œmoney talkâ€ and deprives every individual of his/her right to self-determination regarding toxic vaccines, or when one is harmed by any of Big Pharmaâ€™s vaccinesâ€”as is the case with HPV vaccine damage in the USA.

>The Vaccine Court in the USA often is referred to as a â€˜kangaroo courtâ€™. Thereâ€™s a total legal disconnect in the USA that would never be permitted either in industry, i.e., automotive, manufacturing, etc., or in foreign countriesâ€™ health and legal systems.

>Probably nothing says how or why that disconnect operates so effectively than the [money official lobbying records report.](https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/top.php?indexType=i)

>According to OpenSecrets.org, from 1998 to 2014, Pharmaceuticals/health products gave â€œcool aidâ€ totaling $3,036,664,697 â€“ thatâ€™s $3 Billion plus! 

>Now, there ought to be a law against that, not laws taking away peopleâ€™s rights to prevent toxic poisons being injected into them and/or their children. 

>Thatâ€™s what Adolph Hitlerâ€™s Third Reich did and a justified war was fought about. 

>How come every U.S. citizen now is faced with forced chemical inoculation? Shouldnâ€™t we remember the Nuremberg Code? "
from dead bed to just friends,28,trw4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/trw4y/from_dead_bed_to_just_friends/,10,1337303254,"sorry in advance for the rant. i'm a 28yo male who's been in a relationship with a 28yo female for 3 years now. the first year was awesome. she was smart and hot, she liked me, she initiated things (often vigorously). then it changed. before we started hooking up i explained i'd previously contracted hpv. that old thing. she said she appreciated the fair warning, but she'd already had the vaccine. we moved forward. one year of great sex. 

then the inevitable happened. she contracted hpv anyway. i guess the vaccine only protects against certain strains and it is more effective the longer it's been in the system. she'd only gotten it recently before we started having sex. I was supportive and often went with her to the doctors while she got help. but, needless to say, this negatively altered our relationship.

sex was gone. she was incapable of becoming aroused around me. she never got wet and even with lube sex was painful for her. i tried everything. literally every trick in the book. she would come home and i'd have flowers on the table, dinner cooked, the apartment cleaned, the dishes done, give her a massage, and at the end of the night she still wasnt in the mood. I suggested relationship counseling but she declined. 

three nights ago we admitted the reality of the situation to one another. we are just friends who live together and kiss on the lips. as soon as our lease is up, we're done. unfortunately thats in 3 months from now, but whatever.

things haven't changed much since then. the things that have bubbled beneath the surface are out in the open. we both cried hard that night. she held me while i literally sobbed like a 2nd grader. 

obviously things are odd and i'm sure there are more tears in the future, but i feel like new and better things are in store for both of us. we all deserve to be with someone who wants to have sex with us. even if you have love and companionship, without sex (for me anyway), a relationship is dangerously incomplete. I don't want to tell any of you how to handle your own situations, but I feel we've done the right thing. "
Can it be argued that MRAs are doing more for gays than feminists?,0,1wzol2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1wzol2/can_it_be_argued_that_mras_are_doing_more_for/,10,1391556659,"it seems like when feminists support pro-women and anti-male legislation, they forget about how gay men would be affected

For example, take domestic violence. Feminists push for the female-victim only politicization of domestic violence. The violence against women act, only women's only shelters should exist, etc.

In california, male victims of domestic violence were banned from any state domestic violence service. It was illegal for the state to give anhy resources or have any programs or shelters for men. This was finally overturned in shewry v. california after the national coalition for men, but with heavy feminists resistance.

wouldnt it hurt gay male to not have resoruces for male victims of domestic violence?

and all the stuff i post about free heart screenings for women, etc....doesnt it hurt gay men to be left out? if feminists really care about gay men, why arent they really pushing for the free HPV vaccine for men?

turns out, there was a gay man who posted in r/mensrights about that very thing. he was replying to a post i made about the HPV vaccine being for women only. he is gay, and had previously aligned himself with feminists. he said he and some other guys had brought up the issue, how gay men couldnt get the HPV shot, and how maybe they should campaign to have it for men to...and the mood suddenly changed. the women feminists they were talking to seemed uncomfortable, and started to shun them. 2 weeks later, they were asked to leave the group.

Executions / Capital Punishment is Barbaric. Also applies to Human rights abuses / Rule of Law / International Law,2,3qw3v5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CIWO/comments/3qw3v5/executions_capital_punishment_is_barbaric_also/,0,1446268976,"Note, this page is a counter to any western criticism of executions/capital punishment, human rights abuses, rule of Law, International law, etc.

China use of capital punishment is criticized as barbaric and inhumane. I will explain why this is false. Remember to keep in mind that China has more corruption because itâ€™s a much larger country and itâ€™s a developing country.

In China (and several other Asian countries), society comes before the individual. China punishes major criminals severely, which discourages the crimes. Here, crimes are a glitch of the system.

In the west, the individualâ€™s rights trump society, but often that means the rights of the rich and powerful. The west protects some of the world's worst criminals, which is why they produce so many relative to their population (war criminals, medical, banking/finance, police brutality, etc). Corruption is not a glitch but a key part of their system.

One should ask, do thousands to hundreds of millions of negatively affected lives weigh less than that of a single criminal?

The rest of the document is split by country and then types of crimes and the corresponding punishment or lack thereof. China is up first and then the west. Notice how minor the crimes in China are, relative to western countries, yet the punishment is far more severe than those meted out (if ever) to the worst criminals from the west. That should convince you which of these countries truly cares about human rights, rule of law, and international law - all the values that west hypocritically lecture about.

Now, we analyze the west, but first, a funny quote.

**Racist Police Brutality**

&nbsp;

Even at home, the â€œdefenders of human rightsâ€ treat their own citizens as subhumans unworthy of human dignity let alone human rights.

&nbsp;

>For instance, how does a man who is relatively healthy when taken into custody by police lapse into a coma and die while under their supervision? What kind of twisted logic allows a police officer to use a police car to run down an American citizen and justifies it in the name of permissible deadly force? And what country are we living in where the police can beat, shoot, choke, taser and tackle American citizens, all with the protection of the courts?

&nbsp;

>Certainly, the Constitutionâ€™s safeguards against police abuse means nothing when government agents can crash through your door, terrorize your children, shoot your dogs, and jail you on any number of trumped of charges, and you have little say in the matter. For instance, San Diego police, responding to a domestic disturbance call on a Sunday morning, showed up at the wrong address, only to shoot the homeownerâ€™s 6-year-old service dog in the head.

&nbsp;

>Rubbing salt in the wound, itâ€™s often the unlucky victim of excessive police force who ends up being charged with wrongdoing.

&nbsp;

>The president can now direct the military to detain, arrest and secretly execute American citizens. These are the powers of an imperial dictator, not an elected official bound by the rule of law.

This is the mantra of the financial-crisis era, one that saw virtually every major bank and financial company on Wall Street embroiled in obscene criminal scandals that impoverished millions and collectively destroyed hundreds of billions, in fact, trillions of dollars of the world's wealth â€” and nobody went to jail. Nobody, that is, except Bernie Madoff, a flamboyant and pathological celebrity con artist, whose victims happened to be other rich and famous people.

&nbsp;

>The rest of them, all of them, got off. Not a single executive who ran the companies that cooked up and cashed in on the phony financial boom â€” an industrywide scam that involved the mass sale of mismarked, fraudulent mortgage-backed securities â€” has ever been convicted. Their names by now are familiar to even the most casual Middle American news consumer: companies like AIG, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Most of these firms were directly involved in elaborate fraud and theft. Lehman Brothers hid billions in loans from its investors. Bank of America lied about billions in bonuses. Goldman Sachs failed to tell clients how it put together the born-to-lose toxic mortgage deals it was selling. What's more, many of these companies had corporate chieftains whose actions cost investors billions â€” from AIG derivatives chief Joe Cassano, who assured investors they would not lose even ""one dollar"" just months before his unit imploded, to the $263 million in compensation that former Lehman chief Dick ""The Gorilla"" Fuld conveniently failed to disclose. Yet not one of them has faced time behind bars.

Monsanto is an agribusiness whose resume boasts PCBs, Agent Orange, dioxin, GMO, Aspartame, growth hormones, herbicides (Lasso and Roundup) ... have been marred by health scandals and trials sometimes leading to their prohibition.

>â€¦the flagship brand, the herbicide 2,4,5-T, contains high levels of dioxins, highly toxic and carcinogenic, a composition comparable to that of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).The first study suggesting the potential danger of dioxin was known to Monsanto in 1938: the commercialization of herbicide would continue for nearly another forty years before it was banned in the 1970s.

>In 2001, 3,600 inhabitants of the city of Anniston, Alabama, attacked Monsanto for PCB contamination. According to a report, declassified by the U.S. Agency of Environmental Protection (EPA), Monsanto for
almost forty years dumped thousands of tons of contaminated waste in a stream and an open garbage dump in the heart of a black neighborhood in the city.

>""Monsanto documents -- many emblazoned with warnings such as ""CONFIDENTIAL: Read and Destroy"" -- show that for decades, the corporate giant concealed what it did and what it knew. In 1966, Monsanto managers discovered that fish submerged in that creek turned belly-up within 10 seconds, spurting blood and shedding skin as if dunked into boiling water. They told no one.""

>In 1975, a study conducted by Monsanto showed that PCB causes tumors in rats. The multinational decided to change the terms of ""slightly tumorigenic"" to ""does not appear to be carcinogenic.""

>Monsanto was finally convicted in 2002 of having polluted ""the territory of Anniston and the blood of its people with the PCB"". The firm was ordered to pay $ 700 millionâ€¦No legal action was brought against the company officials.

>In February 2007, The Guardian revealed that the agrochemical giant applied the same methods on multiple sites in Britain between 1965 and 1972.

>During these same years, between 1961 and 1971, Monsanto produced Agent Orange, made   up from the herbicide 2,4,5-T, whose dangerousness has been widely known ever since the explosion of the
Nitro plant. This defoliant was massively dumped by U.S. aircraft over Vietnamese forests during the war. The consequences are still felt today, with many cancers and birth defects occurring in Vietnam.

>During the trial, Monsanto presented scientific studies showing no link between exposure to dioxin and the cancers suffered by many veterans, in order to dismiss their action. It was demonstrated in the
early 1990s that the studies based on the consequences of the explosion at the Nitro plant in 1949 were biased. This scientific fraud is confirmed by the National Research Council,

> Do you remember the advertising and the good dog Rex: ""Roundup does not pollute either the earth or Rexâ€™ bones."" It caused Monsanto to be convicted twice, in the United States and France, for false statements.

>Growth Hormones: scandal on Fox News In early 1990, Monsanto launched their first product derived from biotechnology: Posilac, the recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), genetically engineered hormone designed to increase the production of milk in cows by nearly 20%. This hormone leads to mastitis, inflammation of the udder, which forces farmers to treat their cows with antibiotics, which one then finds traces of in the milk. This miracle product is now banned everywhere except in the United States.

> GMO: Law suits galore. Between 1995 and 1997, GM soybean Roundup Ready, Roundup Ready
canola (rapeseed) and Roundup Ready cotton, all three resistant to the herbicide Roundup, received marketing authorization. It currently produces 90% of GMOs in the world.

> During the 2000s, Monsanto will accuse hundreds of farmers in courts of having used ""fraudulently"" its patented transgenic seeds, that is to say that they are accused of having replanted them.

> In September 2004, Merck, one of America's largest pharmaceutical companies, issued a sudden recall of Vioxx. The recall came just days after Merck discovered that a top medical journal was about to publish a study by an FDA (Food and Drug Administration) investigator indicating that the drug in question greatly increased the risk of fatal heart attacks and strokes and had probably been responsible for at least 55,000 American deaths during the five years it had been on the market.

&nbsp;

> It soon turned out Merck had known of potential lethal side effects even before launching Vioxx in 1999, but had brushed all such disturbing tests under the rug.

&nbsp;

> The year after the scandal unfolded, Merck's long-time CEO resigned and was replaced by one of his top lieutenants. But he retained the $50 million in financial compensation he had received over the previous five years. Neither he nor any other Merck executives was charged with corporate malfeasance.

&nbsp;

>The inescapable conclusion is that in today's world and in the opinion of our own media, American lives are quite cheap, unlike those in China.

> â€œRecombinant bovine growth hormone, also known as rBGH or rBST, is injected into cows to make them produce more milk. This practice, which is known to cause harm to cows and may pose harm to humans, is banned in Canada, Japan, Australia, and all 25 countries of the European Union.

&nbsp;

>RBGH causes udder infections in cows, which are treated with antibiotics. Increased antibiotic use in food animals is a serious problem because it creates antibiotic resistant bacteria and is strongly linked to human infections that are difficult to treat. Injections of rBGH also increase another hormone, called IGF-1, in the cow and the cowâ€š milk. Too much IGF-1 in humans is linked with increased rates of colon, breast, and prostate cancer.â€

At the time, a study had decided that a fungus tag-teaming with a virus was killing the beesâ€”but the studyâ€™s lead author, Montana bee researcher Dr. Jerry Bromenshenk, had originally signed up to be an expert witness on behalf of beekeepers who brought a class-action lawsuit against Bayer in 2003. He suddenly dropped outâ€”and immediately received a significant research grant from Bayer to study bee pollination, which has continued in recent years. It should come as no surprise that Bayer pesticides were never mentioned in the study as a potential cause of CCD.

>Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency seems to be turning a blind eye to the situation. Even though they acknowledge that pesticides kill bees, they hurry to differentiate this from colony collapse disorder. And when listing possible causes of colony collapse, pesticides are conspicuously absent.

Pesticides Definitively Linked to Bee Colony Collapse

Western geniuses are collapsing entire bee colonies. Why is that troubling?

>Honeybees and the other pollinators and the invaluable pollinating services they provide us with helped produce approximately $19 billion worth of agricultural crops in the U.S. alone in 2010; thatâ€™s estimated to be one-third of everything we eat! The other animal pollinators such as bats, moths, butterflies, hummingbirds, ants, and beetles contributed to an estimated $10 billion in 2010! To say we rely on the pollination efforts of bees (and other animals) to sustain our modern food system is an understatement.

Hmmm, let's be more realistic, how about the HPV jab which warns on it's insert that it can harm fertility, the program started right at the end of 2006 and by late 2007 about one quarter of US females age 13â€“17 years had received at least one of the three HPV shots.

So, is it MTV or HPV Jabs?  Well, studies are already coming out showing that the HPV jab has left many girls infertile and sent many others into early Menopause.

A favorite line of the Reddit Pro-Vaccine Squad is ""Anti-vaxxer's will leave the gene pool, this is Darwinism at work"" yet what we're seeing now is that it's the Pro-Vaxxer's leaving the gene pool, while the educated anti-vaxxer's are sticking around.

As most of you know, the Elite/Banker's have inscribed on the Georgia Guidestones to ""Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.""  So those 500 million remaining are going to be mainly descended from the anti-vaxxer's who kept their fertility intact.  Will this be seen as a problem?  Not necessarily, as the Georgia Guidestones also recommend to ""Guide reproduction wisely"" i.e. you have to have brains to stay in the genepool, the dumb will fall for the propaganda and get themselves sterilized.  

This is all a challenge, they are guiding reproduction, they are separating the wheat from the chaff, that is why vaccine exemptions still exist.

"Me [41 M] with my SO [38 F] of 3 years, Think we might be about to break up and just really sad. Open relationship and lots of drama.",2,3j1le6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/3j1le6/me_41_m_with_my_so_38_f_of_3_years_think_we_might/,1,1441023495,"My SO and I have been together for about 3 and a half years, and I have fucked up the relationship a bunch, and so has she. We started out as open, and have alternately been open and not open, but mostly open. Pretty early on in the relationship I didn't tell her about an online flirtation with a girl, that had one makeout session... a pretty minor one at that. However, there were a lot of messages between us. She found out by seeing the messages, and we worked through it but things were pretty rocky.

Now, part of the issue at that time was that I was pretty checked out of the relationship. I was working a really, really shitty contract at the time and it was having some major negative repercussions on my psyche. We weren't living together at the time.

Later, she wanted to go on vacation. She has a daughter and had promised her daughter a trip anywhere in the world for her 10th birthday. This was potentially a bit overly ambitious, since she really couldn't afford to go anywhere in the world - but her daughter picked a place that was within what she could manage, and she invited me. At the time, she was going to pay for me to come along. We had moved in together, and our bills were pretty low. Now, come time to book the tickets she changes it. She can't afford to pay for me, or rather while she can she can only do it on credit so she needs to be paid back. I agreed to go. We were in a rocky patch, and were kind of looking at the vacation as being a bit of a re-connect (at least that's what we talked about as we were planning it). Also important, at this point she owns the house we are living in and I pay her. She pays the bills.

So, we take our vacation. Some stuff happens, it ends up being a little bit more expensive than anticipated. Not a big deal, but a bit more. Also, our stuff gets stolen while on vacation. Our cottage got broken into and a bunch of stuff got taken. Most of the stuff that was taken was mine, because they used my bag to carry stuff. She is going to put in an insurance claim to get some money back for what was taken.

Now, I kind of put paying her back off too much. Did it in little dribs and drabs. I suck at paperwork, and my pay kept coming up short. I didn't know why at the time, and kept trying to get an answer from my employer. I mean a lot short by the way. Well, it turned out that I had some tax debt from when I ran a business that never got settled. It wasn't a lot, but they were garnishing my pay and I had never received a letter. Anyway, I was slow paying her back... and I didn't talk to her about it (this is a common theme, I am not very good at communication. This post is actually an attempt for me to organize my thoughts coherently among other things). This frustrated the hell out of her. Also, I lost my drivers license. Two year suspension because my insurance had been cancelled without my knowledge (child support related, my license was pulled for non-payment, because they didn't stop charging me child support even though my son was 18 and living with me - my ex didn't send in a letter letting them know he wasn't attending university and living with her - when my license was pulled my insurance was automatically cancelled. I got the license sorted out in a couple of hours... didn't realize about the insurance). So yeah, I have a hard time with paperwork and bureaucracy. 

She is flirting with people online. She's telling me about it, and I even talked to one guy. She's a bit (or a lot) kinky. They met up one day, and she ended up blowing him. Told me as soon as she got home and cleaned herself up. It was unexpected, and I was a bit put off, because of it being unexpected... but it was within the rules of our relationship. I had also had a side bit, although right at the start, and the one girl I was flirting with online for a long time. Anyway, they get hot and heavy... and every time I have any problem with any aspect of things it is a huge fight. She tells me that she's set things up for me so that it's really convenient because when he's coming over it's a good match for my schedule... but she's basing it off of an old schedule and it means I'm out of the house for a full day when I have 3 hours work first thing in the morning. I say it's cool, but it's not convenient. Massive fight. She accused me of trying to derail her thing with this guy.

She fucks him without a condom. Doesn't tell me about it for months afterwards. That's strictly against the rules. Finally, she breaks down and confesses. I decide to forgive her, but my condition is no more contact with this guy. Months go by, no contact with the guy. Then she messages me, tells me that she just started talking to him again. I'm not okay with this, but it's already done, so I accept it. 

My license is costing more than expected... lots of fees and fines. I don't tell her that it's costing more, and she keeps wondering why I don't get it back, even though my suspension is up. I keep not telling her, hiding it. I get a loan to pay off the fines and try to keep it from her. She finds out (after me flirting online I gave her access to my email). She gets very, very angry. Part of the reason is that I went to a lender of last resort, which loans out at a higher interest rate. I did it because I wanted it to happen fast, so that she wouldn't notice. Trying to just make things better. Another of my bad traits. Trying to just make the problem go away, without talking to anyone or getting input. We fight, we almost break up. We end up staying together. 

At this point she is still sometimes seeing the guy on the side... but he's not working out very well. Partially because he is cheating on his girlfriend who doesn't know anything about it.

We go to a party one night. She meets this guy, he's funny and has an accent. He's a pretty nice guy and is in an open relationship as well.  They start to hang out. Smoke weed together (she likes weed quite a bit, I don't smoke it - or at least very, very rarely, I don't like it all that much, prefer drinking most of the time). Stuff starts happening between them. Her and I are fighting a lot at this point. She tells me that since the loan thing she no longer sees me as a competent person. Basically she sees me as an idiot, and not someone she can rely on. Part of that is that I am still paying off the vacation, and that I don't really ask about bills (something she has very clearly asked me to do). Part of that is choosing a lender of last resort, and the fact that even one I got the loan there were a couple more fines, so I still didn't even have my license back.

For her birthday she wants to have a party. Gets the idea of having a glow in the dark themed party in her head. Starts to get the stuff for the party, then decides she doesn't want to do it. I have a survival weekend set up for the weekend before her birthday (so not interfering with her party). Her new ""friend"" decides that they should have a private party the weekend I am away. I'm cool with that, I actually like the guy. I'm flirting with a couple of girls, and we have had one experience with a girl together (pretty minimal participation from the girl, she mostly just watched us). So, my survival trip gets cancelled and she is quite clearly upset - but offers to cancel her weekend plans (since it involves our house). I offer to go out drinking that night, but she's not cool with it because she doesn't want a time limit on her fun. I use the money I was going to use on my survival trip to book myself a hotel room and let them have the house for the night. I make plans to go drinking with a female friend who I have a bit of a thing for, but who I am pretty sure isn't going to go down that road with me. 

This is planned for Saturday night. Thursday the girl that we had messed around with a tiny bit a long time earlier comes over. We end up playing around, and I push things a tiny bit with my SO... she's a bit uncomfortable, but ends up being really into it at the time. Afterwards she thanks me for taking her outside her comfort zone and tells me what a great night it was. Saturday I take off as planned, go to my hotel room, have a great night drinking, end up back at my hotel room alone. Next morning we have brunch together. Over the course of the night my SO and the guy took E and did a line of coke. When I was young I had a problem with coke, and she keeps saying she is super tired. I say I think that part of that might be coming down from the coke. She says that is absolutely not the case. I don't let it drop, bringing it up 3 more times. We get into a huge fight. She thinks the fight is about her spending the night with the guy (the night I went to a great deal of trouble and expense to make happen because she so clearly wanted it to). In fact there are a number of little things that I am having an issue with. The bed isn't made, she did strip the sheets (which I appreciate) but then left it unmade (she slept all the next day basically, from when we finished brunch until about midnight). There was lube on the bathroom floor. I slipped on it. Not a bottle of lube, a puddle. There was lube on the coffee table. I accidentally put my phone in it. That's how I found it. There were condom wrappers everywhere. I found them for days afterwards. None of that is a big deal, but it all added up to me feeling like there was a giant fuck you going on. We fought, and then we made up. I have a bad habit of deflecting fights back on her... so when she brings up something she has an issue with I tend to find ways that she's being shitty. It's a communication issue, and comes from being pretty defensive.

We talk about having more encounters with the girl we played with, in some detail. She tells me about sexual fantasies involving me and the other girl.

Her side guy (she's down to just the new one at this point, things fizzled with the no condom guy) is having issues with his SO over the two of them. He didn't tell her the whole deal a couple of times - so she's insecure about them. Me, being a fucking moron, suggest that maybe if the four of us hung out it could help things along. Maybe if she saw us as a couple she would be happier with where things sit. So, we make a plan to go to an event at a local bar - and the girl my SO and I have played with is also going to come with us. So, the event was last night (Saturday). Friday my SO confesses to me that she's ""a little bit in love"" with the new guy. I get her to admit that it's more than a little, and that she was trying to minimize. Saturday morning she asks how I am doing with us. I tell her that I wish she wasn't falling in love with new guy, but I'm okay. I ask her how she is feeling about us. When she basically doesn't answer I push a bit. She starts listing off all the ways she thinks I'm a shitty partner. This lasts for over an hour and continues as we have brunch at a cafe. We fight, and fight, and fight, and fight. Finally she tries to make up with me, and then drops that she doesn't want anything to happen with the girl because the girl has HPV (this is not new information, my SO has the vaccine, there was never any question of not using protection) and that one of the main reasons for this is the new guy had a recent scare around HPV, and she doesn't want to have to tell him about messing around with someone with HPV. I suggest we just avoid that sort of activity (with what we have done so far the risk is actually 0) and just stick to the sort of things we have done in the past. She doesn't really answer that. 

We go to the bar last night. Her new guy is there with his partner. I like her, we have similar taste in music. She's not my type sexually, but seems like a cool chick. My SO spends most of the evening hanging out with new guy (which is probably not the best way to reassure his partner) and I spend most of the night dancing solo. At one point we are getting ready to go and I go to the washroom. I come back and SO and new guy are making out. She give me a half hearted apology, and keeps going on about how what he is wearing is too sexy, it was beyond her control.

At home we are hanging out with the girl, and then my SO goes to bed. I join her, and end up having sex with her. It's a bit rough, and part of that might be a subconscious desire to assert ownership over her or something. It sucked watching her make out with side guy. I really don't mind them together, but when I'm there it's not cool. Anyway, this morning I get up and come to the living room. SO and girl are sitting there watching porn. Girl is on a chair, SO is on the couch. I am at this point wearing just a house coat. I end up having sex with SO, and was a bit pushy about it (which is something she has actually given me blanket permission for, it's kind of one of her kinks). Girl isn't really involved, just watches. Now, after, my SO tells me that she's really, really sore. That I've pushed her too far, and now she needs a nap. Alright, cool enough. We are also supposed to have dinner with my family later. She asks if she can bail on it and I say sure, I'll make excuses for her and go solo. I do that. I come home and she's on the couch, watching TV. We talk a bit. I tell her that I really didn't think she was going to be that sore (since we have had rougher sex in the past and for longer). She ends up saying she thinks I was punishing her for what happened the night before. I tell her it wasn't punishment, but maybe was a bit about trying to recoop some of my own. She still thinks this means punishment, but I meant more about the idea that she wants me (remember, rough sex has always been a huge thing between us - and she had been doing the thing she does where she tells me I can't have her, usually this is a kind of play, but it does mean rough is my only option). It feels very weird to be disclosing these kind of intimate details on the Internet... anyway, as I'm typing this I'm realizing that a big part of it is that if we didn't have sex after me seeing her making out with new guy it would have been pretty crushing. 

So, we sort of stop talking about it... talking in more general terms. She is telling me she doesn't feel like I love her at that moment. I am saying that when I walked into the room she was in at the bar I didn't feel like she loved me. We talk a bit more, the whole time I'm rubbing her hips, which are very sore. I say that we have really been putting each other through the ringer. She says she doesn't know what else she could have done. In a bad moment I say that she could have not made out with new guy in the bar... 

So, she flies off the handle at me. Says my making things happen with the girl is terrible, and that I made her participate while she just had a momentary thing that she has already apologized for, and that I should not be taking her to task for that in this moment because I'm just doing the thing where I deflect back on her. Says she wants to sleep separately tonight (this is something we never do). 

Here's the thing: I think I might be done. I love her, and I have fucked up quite a lot (mostly by hiding things from her/lying to her), but I'm not sure I can handle the state of our relationship. We go a day or two at most without fighting. I can't ever raise a concern in any way without her freaking out on me (unless she brings it up first) and I think that if we stay together I will spend the rest of my life suffering for my mistakes. If that came with happiness, then that's the price I pay - but I don't know that I can live the rest of my life paying for mistakes even if they are legit... and I don't know if I can spend the rest of my life not able to ever bring up things that hurt me. Yes, I didn't bring it up in the best way, but when she said she didn't know what else she could do something in my brain snapped. It's really fucking easy, don't make out with the guy while I'm in the bar with you.

On a side note: finally have all my fines and fees paid, but still need to do a new road test. It's scheduled.

Small tag-like things on labia minora. No pain but worried it could be genital warts?,4,2ai2yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/2ai2yt/small_taglike_things_on_labia_minora_no_pain_but/,2,1405189796,"http://imgur.com/8QWn8hu

Well, I'm a female, 5'1, 110lbs, in the US. I take no medications.

Noticed these tag-like things just a few days ago on the inside of my labia minora, next to the vaginal opening. I'm with a steady boyfriend, and we haven't had vaginal/anal sex, but have done oral. Neither of us have a history of STIs. I have appointment with my GP in a few weeks and will ask her about them, but they've been keeping me up at night, very worried. They do not hurt or itch, and the bit of blood comes from the fact that I tugged on one to see if it'd snap off. Could it be genital warts? Skin tags? Alien colony? I was vaccinated against HPV but I've heard the vaccine doesn't always protect against all strains? I really have no idea. Anyway, any help or insight is appreciated!"
Is it worth it for me to get the HPV vaccine?,6,zkhxf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/zkhxf/is_it_worth_it_for_me_to_get_the_hpv_vaccine/,9,1347163324,"Right now, I'm a 26 year old male, and according to some information I've found, my health insurance provider offers a benefit for males age ""9 through 26"" for the HPV vaccine as a ""medical"" procedure (as opposed to a ""preventative"" procedure, which is how they classify it for females).

As a bisexual male, I'm aware that I'm in a higher risk class for colon and throat cancer, vis Ã¡ vis the Human Papilloma Virus. The phrasing ""through 26"" is somewhat ambiguous for me, and I've submitted a request for further clarification to my insurance provider (their call center is closed over the weekend, so I'm e-mailing them just in case I forget to call on Monday). Because of waiting so long to get it, there's no way all three injections will be covered by insurance, since I'll hit 27 before, at least, the third injection (unless we bend the rules and get the third one in about two weeks early).

According to the clinic I visited today, it's about $230 per dose. If it were $100, I'd have said, ""screw it,"" and got it whether I was covered or not. I can swallow $300 over six months, but almost $700 over six months is a bit harder on my budget. I'm debating doing it anyway, since it's hard to put a price on my health (the person I saw today made out a prescription for me, so if I decide to go through it, I just need to show up and get it done), but I'm wondering if I'm being a bit paranoid.

Quick facts: 26, no penetrative sexual history to report, sexual history is reasonably safe (and boring, not that safe is by necessity boring), birthday is in the last week of February, I actually have a proper insurance plan, with a reputable national provider, through my employer.

**Update:** Alright, you've convinced me. I've put in a request to my nearest Planned Parenthood for an appointment this upcoming weekend (the only time I'll be able to be 100% positive my work schedule won't get in the way). I knew it was a good idea, I just needed some encouragement to get over the potential sticker shock of a full price dosage.

**Update 2:** I'm going in tomorrow for my first dosage. (Tomorrow being exactly seven days after this posting)"
Sexism in medicine.,1,c80cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/c80cr/sexism_in_medicine/,26,1274841533,"So, we all know a lot of the basic complaints--discrimination against/invisibility of men with breast cancer and no vaccine against HPV on one side, Viagra being covered by insurance but not birth control on the other, etc. And I wanna talk about them, see how many we can come up with.



I don't want to talk about gender-specific cancers, really--sure, prostate cancer gets less funding than breast cancer, but cervical cancer gets less than prostate, but this one kills more and that one's slower, etc. Cancer is cancer, and it sucks for everyone, but I want to talk more about regular, more day-to-day issues, rather than life-threatening ones.



Why? Because I, a lady, am suffering from a urinary tract infection today. Almost every woman I know has had one, or worse yet suffers from them regularly, as unfortunately I do, as often as once a month. Very few men suffer from them, and even more rarely do you catch them spontaneously (as in, most men who get them catch them from a woman with one, like with yeast infections). 



Yet, despite how awful and common this is for women, there is no way to treat it without visiting a doctor first. There is a harmless medicine (not the antibiotics, just a pain reliever) to make the pain go away, which doesn't interact with other medicines and is safe even for pregnant women, but it is not easily available in the US; I would have to order it from overseas. There is absolutely no reason the pain meds for it shouldn't be available over the counter. And yet.



To me, this smacks of the same female-dismissive medical trends in other more daily aspects--that birth control, especially the non-pill more effective ones, is often not covered or requires a much higher copay; that the more effective treatments for yeast infections are not over-the-counter, nor *any* treatments for bacterial vaginosis; the way many side effects of birth control are ignored or dismissed. UTIs usually come from sex, and so the ""logic"" of keeping all treatment prescription only is either some perverse slut-shaming or, more likely, just ignorance from the male-dominated industry, because for men, burning when you pee is more often an STD so you do want to be tested. But for women, it's like keeping all the cold meds behind the counter just because it *might* be tuberculosis or something.



This kind of thing comes up in TwoX and in conversation with women quite often, and I feel like there *has* to be another side to, because with sexism there generally is.



I already know two from your side--the HPV vaccine, and the trouble men can have getting a Plan B pill without a woman there. Give me some more, and please feel free to describe any horrible things that men experience but women often don't in detail. UTIs more than anything make me believe women got the short end of the genitalia stick, but I could be blind to male issues I just don't know about.



Edited to make more sense.



**tl;dr: I want to know what *everyday* medical issues affect men but not women, and whether or not you feel they are ignored because they are gender-specific, because I find it hard to believe that it can be a one-sided issue.**"
Potential reaction to the third hpv shot?,1,3c0u5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/3c0u5c/potential_reaction_to_the_third_hpv_shot/,1,1435978900,"I'm a 21 year old female and I'm 103lbs. I got my thud and final hpv shot yesterday morning at 9:30 and I believe one developed a fever because of it. My skin feels bruised and my muscles and joints hurt. I don't know if that's caused by the fever out because of the vaccine. 

I only had pain around the injection site for the first two shots so I find it weird I'm having such a bad reaction to the third. My main questions are should I go to a doctor to get checked out and how long do these reactions last? 

I've felt like utter crap since 6ish last night and got some really crappy sleep because of the skin, joint and muscle pain. I had to call in sick to work today but don't have that option tomorrow for the 4th. Feeling the way I am right now, I'm going to have a really hard time working. 

Any advice would be helpful."
Should my girlfriend get the HPV vaccine outside of age range?,3,12viuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/12viuz/should_my_girlfriend_get_the_hpv_vaccine_outside/,4,1352436155,"**Background:**

Male 30.  I have a genital wart strain of HPV.  I have not had symptoms for about a year.

Female 30.  She has had HPV before but it was a strain that caused abnormal pap smears.  It has been gone for 2 years.

**Sex life:**

I informed her that i had HPV before we first had sex.  We are aware that you can pass HPV even when using a condom.  We have been having *protected* sex for about a month and we are thinking about getting her the HPV Vaccine(gardasil).  

**Going forward:**

I assume that we are a perfect candidate to get the shot for her protection.

**Issues:**

* She is concerned about getting it when she is out of the range it is approved for.  She is 30.  Has anyone got the shot later in life?
* Can the shot cause any health problems?
* Insurance will not cover this since she is too old.  So it will be a $600 expense.  Is this money well spent?"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's your opinion on idiot anti-vaccine people like Jenny McCarthy? Also, what's your most memorable project/experiment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsj4xc?context=5)|Jenny McCarthy should take an immunology course. Vaccines are the most effective way to protect against deadly diseases. Prevention of disease is ALWAYS far better than treatment. Vaccines don't cause autism, although some people do have mild side-effects. These side effects are due to your immune system and are a good sign. People who claim that vaccines are bad simply don't know what they're talking about. In my mind, the question is really how early to start vaccinations in children, and there is some controversy in this area. For example, it could be argued that vaccines given too early are not as effective on the developing immune system, and could predispose a child to allergy (although this too is controversial). A much bigger problem, though, is all the anti-vaccine hype in the media, which causes parents to wait far too long to vaccinate their children (or not vaccinate at all)... this puts their children at huge risk of infection.
 |Most memorable project... probably the one that everyone said wouldn't work, and then I proved did! Scientists are notorious nay-sayers, until something is accomplished, and then they say it was obvious anyway! :-) 
[Jenny McCarthy in an immunology class would be started with ""Well, I read online that...""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgswfsd?context=5)|The one good thing about people like her is that they annoy scientists who know better, so we go on reddit to answer questions. In addition they force us to find better ways  and time to communicate with the public. Every cloud has a silver lining!
[Many hospitals have mandatory flu vaccination policies to protect patients. what do you think about health care workers who refuse vaccination because it conflicts with their religious beliefs? from 1-10 how stupid do you think that is? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsjf0q?context=5)|I think if it conflicts with their religious beliefs, that is their belief and should be respected, but they should find another profession which does not conflict with their religious beliefs. Remember that if they get the flu they will spread it through an entire hospital population of already sick patients. A key feature of religious freedom and tolerance is not to force the consequences of your religious beliefs on others.
[Could you elaborate on your concerns with the ""ethics in scientific endeavors""?  I may not know much, but aside from the whole ""vaccines are bad for you"" train of thought that some people have, what ethical issues do you typically deal with? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsjf2u?context=5)|There is too much pressure on scientists to publish in order to get funding and promotion. I've been seeing an increase in the incidence of scientific fraud as funding dries up and grants become more competitive. Therefore, they often will take shortcuts in reproducing their own experiments, publish too early, or cherry-pick data to support their claims. This wastes money and time, since others can't reproduce their work, and this gives false hope to the American public. If nothing else it is better to be thorough and honest rather than famous.
[Is science becoming too politically correct? Too privately funded? or a combination thereof. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsk5ea?context=5)|No, not really. The problem is that federal funding often goes to the more ""trendy"" science, as opposed to translating discoveries that could have huge impact on disease. Private funding is not an issue--if anything, LACK of private funding is a problem. It's really hard to get private pharma to fund anything that doesn't have an immediate and measureable fiscal payoff.
[Do you think there could ever be another ""plague"" that we couldn't find a vaccine to quickly? If so, what traits would that disease have to make it so resilient?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsjoaa?context=5)|Yes. I think plagues will be constantly emerging, and there is good evidence to support this view. There are many reasons it could be resilent-- it could kill quickly, be airborne, compromise the immune system that's needed to destroy it (a la HIV), it could rapidly mutate such that each vaccine becomes ineffective, etc. The key will be to identify emerging diseases as quickly as possible to isolate the causative agent and to have an effective method to generate a vaccine. The vaccines should be stable, scalable, and rapidly deployable. We are making progress. In today's world, where people can be in China one day and California the next, emerging diseases are a plane-ride away.
[How close do you think we are using immunotherapy to effectively treat cancer? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsjaz2?context=5)|We're already doing it! and there are 100's more immunotherapies in clinical trials. The challenge is not treatment but cure, of course. And that is going to involve better methods for early detection.
[When might we get to see needle-less vaccines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsjz0k?context=5)|We already have them in the form of nasal sprays (influenza) and sugar-cubes (polio). Trans-dermal patches are not far away. It may be possible in the future to put vaccines in food!
[Science is awesome! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsvtfy?context=5)|And EXPENSIVE!
[Is there a benefit to a needle-less vaccine other than people are big babies and don't like to get shots?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgt20tj?context=5)|One of the biggest problems with vaccination is compliance. People don't like needles for themselves or their kids. If one did not have needles, compliance would be much higher and our population would be better protected.  Scientifically speaking, introducing vaccines into the dermis is a highly efficient way to immunize due to the presence of cells called Langerhans cells. So, it should be possible to give lower doses as well.  I am a big fan of this approach for both reasons.
[If you had to pick one of the current bleeding-edge projects in immunology as being the one most likely to lead to knocking another killer disease out of mass circulation, which one would you pick and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsjgr5?context=5)|My crystal ball is at the cleaners, but I think that personalized medicine in all fields of disease will have the biggest impact on human health and well being in the near future. There is no longer any reason to believe that one-size-fits-all when it comes to treating or preventing disease. Many of the breakthroughs will come from understanding genomics, proteomics, and harnessing this information to determine how to handle each individual based on his or her risks, predispositions, and responses to therapeutics.
[In your career and field, what kind of progressions would you like to see by the end of your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsj5it?context=5)|Two things. First, I would like to see more interactions between basic and clinical scientists and far less time-sucking compliance. By the end of my career, I would like to see many things, but the first that comes to mind is to promote science more--locally, nationally, and internationally. We are wasting too many hours and too many dollars on administration, compliance, politics, and egos, and not spending enough time solving problems.
[How deep is the crisis in the lack of federal funding for scientific research?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsj7u2?context=5)|The crisis is enormous. We are losing a whole generation of new scientists and we are shelving an entire generation of seasoned mentors. Our government needs to get its act together before our profession goes down the rabbit hole.
[What would you say to those who choose not to vaccinate their children?  What would you say to Adults who choose to not get vaccines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsk40m?context=5)|They are both making big mistakes based on a lot of misinformation and hype. Side effects from vaccines, when they occur, are trivial compared to the diseases they prevent. Would you rather have a headache for two days for be sick with flu for 3 weeks? Remember too, that if you don't get vaccinated, you risk more than disease in yourself. You risk spreading it to other people as well, and this is very selfish.
[Hi there, thanks for taking the time to do this AMA and for all your thorough answers. What sort of ethical considerations/limitations do you take into account when developing a new vaccine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgslsqs?context=5)|Most of the ethical considerations involve the clinical trials in humans. You must acquire enough safety data in animals to be convinced that you are not going to cause unacceptable side-effects in humans. You must also be willing to design your trial whereby you start with very low doses and gradually escalate, watch every vaccinated individual carefully for a period of time (usually a month) and make sure you are DILLIGENT about following your protocol.
[One more question, and I'm sure you'll get asked about this more than a few times since it's a hot button issue on reddit, but what can be done about the resurgence of diseases in the wake of the claims of people like Edward Hooper or Jenny McCarthy? Obviously we need to simply keep educating people and continuing to push forward with vaccination programs, but is there anything else that you think we should be doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgslsqs?context=5)|Second question--How to answer that? You are right, education is everything. We all know that people love conspiracy theories or feel that the medical profession is hiding things from them. I think it becomes the responsibility of every scientists to COMMUNICATE effectively with the population, rather than hole up in our labs and ignore the fact that people are social creatures and need interaction. By building trust amongst researchers, physicians, and the population at large, I hope that this problem will... go away...
[I am currently going to graduate school for my PhD in Immunology, and I am a woman. Do you have any advice for a woman in such a male dominated field? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsl7jw?context=5)|Keep your eye on the ball and don't let people derail you with sexist comments or anything that makes you waste your time obsessing over the fact that you're a woman. In the end, your good work will shine through. Be careful before you say ""yes"" to serving on committees and giving lectures, because every committee/course/group in biomedical science ""needs a woman."" Nobody is keeping track of the number of times you say ""no."" So take care of yourself and be as productive as possible, first and foremost. When all fails, humor is hugely helpful! :-)
[This may or may not be related to the breakthrough you're working on (I know very little biology\), but if two antigens share a similar physical trait but are otherwise dissimilar, is it possible to develop a vaccine that will create antibodies that target that specific trait?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgskebh?context=5)|YES! Come work in my lab and I'll show you how. :-)
[What do you think will be the next big breakthrough with vaccines?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsje27?context=5)|With all humility, I think I may be working on it. The idea is to make vaccines that are broadly protective against all strains of a pathogen (e.g. a vaccine against ALL strains of influenza or HIV) by using entirely safe synthetic structures.
[How much of a risk is it that viruses are becoming more resistant or immune to vaccines? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsk2ug?context=5)|Virtually any virus can mutate in the population to evade a previous vaccination. The key will be to develop vaccines against conserved structures that cannot mutate. I don't think the problem is necessarily getting worse, but that we are becoming more aware of it as we develop more and more sophisticated vaccines.
[How long do you think it will be before we have this type of vaccine?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsnamw?context=5)|It all depends on funding (and how well it continues to work). Right now I'm trying to raise money for my broken mass spec! Go figure.
 |However... if I had all the money in the world AND it continues to work, I believe I could have it done and in clinical trials in 6-8 years. That said, these predictions are very difficult to make. Sometimes things take longer than you think... occasionally you have sudden breakthroughs.
[Is it true that mercury and other harmful things are put into vaccines? If so, why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsrtpg?context=5)|In the past, yes. Less so now. These agents were/are  used as stabilizers or preservatives. As we acquire more knowledge and information, nasty things are no longer added to vaccines.
 |Just think, who knew that cigarette smoke was harmful 50 years ago?  Who knew that trans-fats in foods could kill you? Changes happen as we learn more. Hindsight is always 20/20.
[Have you always wanted to make vaccines?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsjm17?context=5)|No. My interest in vaccines is a fairly recent one, based on connecting the many dots of immunology into a bigger picture. The more you see the big picture, the more you realize what we are missing in terms of developing effective new vaccines (broad immunogenicity, relationship between auto- and useful-immunity, etc). As I realized this in my own field, I decided to get involved in this very translational type of research. It's terribly tedious and complicated but it's exciting and has a HUGE payoff if you get it right. I'm trying!
[Aside from cancer, what major ailment/disease seems the most daunting from a research perspective?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsk2xp?context=5)|Alzheimer's and other brain disorders. In general, as we live longer, and are not as susceptible to infectious diseases because of vaccinations, we will be dealing more with ""diseases"" of the elderly. i.e. wear and tear on organs, degeneration of mental capacity, etc.
[I've seen many scientists, when given their own labs, end up spending most of their time in management and grant-writing rather than actual research -- is this because there is a ceiling for seniority in research that they have no choice but to move into management?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgskegr?context=5)|The more senior you get, and the more people and projects you are responsible for, the more fundraising and administration fall on your head. Therefore, many senior scientists rarely get into the lab, because they are too busy keeping the ship afloat rather than seeking out new ports. Especially nowadays, even junior scientists who should be in the lab full time are spending much of their time raising money and trying to handle increasing administrative burden. 
[Can this work be realistically be offloaded to management specialists so that scientists can do more science work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsr797?context=5)|Some of it  can...but you need to write the grants and do the administrative work to higher the management specialists...to then manage the hiring of more managers...:( 
[Dr. Ellen Vitetta, SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS SYSTEM! Do you think many scientists could be persuaded to join an institution with less prestige but more opportunities to do science rather than management?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgt5wrk?context=5)|Yes it is. In my view (and just about everybody's) we need MORE Federal funding, a serious paperwork reduction act, fewer compliance courses and more scientists than administrators. When I entered this profession, administrators worked for scientists... Now it's the reverse. We scientists are terrified of litigation... And lawyers are getting rich.
 |I really don't think that the institution matters. There are just too many government agencies making too many rules. Ther are too many expensive and time- sucking lawsuits. We need to infuse some common sense into our government and into our science policy. Scientists have little time to THINK and be creative these days. Personally... I think that the tail is wagging the dog. Our government works for US , not the reverse. If you agree with me, contact your reps in Congress. Our constitution starts with ""We the people""...
[You mention women in science, but I haven't seen any questions on it. I have a few.  What changes have you seen in promotion or discrimination regarding gender over your career?  What can female scientists do to promote or encourage women to reach the peak of their field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsrw4e?context=5)|Its always a concern...that has not changed. There are no tricks. Believe in yourself and work hard to achieve your goals. Smile and BE confident when you know what you are talking about. If you don't, go and find out. Don't be a pleaser (as many women are). Be fair but tough and straightforward. The more successful you are, the less you will care about the negative perceptions of others. That is THEIR problem, not yours.  Men don't seem to mind being called tough or hard-assed. Why should women? Think about that...
[What advice would you give to women transitioning from the role of a postdoc to the role of a PI/mentor? Do you have any tips or tricks on how to be as ambitious/hard-ass/confident as male counterparts without being perceived negatively? In 2014, is that even a concern on the level that it might have been in the '70s/'80s/'90s? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsrw4e?context=5)|Things are slowly improving. Men and women are entering grad. and med. school in the U.S. in equal numbers. The real bottleneck now is getting women to  the top levels. There are many reasons for this bottleneck... some involving the women themselves. Many women simply don't want to march into battle each day. Also remember that even though discrimination is more subtle now but it has not gone away.  We women have to focus on our goals and not on the things that could de-rail is. 
[What makes viruses so much more difficult to find a vaccine for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsk678?context=5)|Their high rate of mutation and rapid spread through our highly geographically-mobile society. Also, isolating the causative virus to MAKE a vaccine in the first place can take time, while the virus continues to mutate.
[Do bacteria not mutate? Or just not as fast as a virus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgskew8?context=5)|Most bacteria mutate less often and in a different way than viruses. Most often, they develop drug resistance. However, if you are able to vaccinate against them in the first place (against bacteria, which CAN be vaccinated against), drug resistance would become a non-issue. This is part of what I find so exciting about vaccines! If you prevent the infection, you don't have to deal with all kinds of downstream problems!
[So with HIV/AIDS being a virus how are we able to combat it so well now? Does it not mutate like other viruses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsldum?context=5)|Left unchecked, all viruses mutate. The biggest problem with HIV is that it grows in the very immune system that you need to combat it, and therefore is more devastating. We still cannot vaccinate against HIV because of the many mutations and different substrains that exist. This is true of many different viruses. With regard to HIV, what we CAN do is treat somebody who is already infected and thereby turn this into a chronic as opposed to an acute disease. This has happened because of the many anti-viral drugs which have come onto the marketplace over the last 20 years. Did I interpret your question correctly?
[ the flu, how do we have a flu vaccine. Isn't it a virus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsmhxy?context=5)|Yes, it is a virus. Each annual flu vaccine in fact contains 3 flu strains. however, you have to give this vaccine every year because next year the strains may be different or may be the same with additional mutations. Therefore this year's vaccine may not protect against next year's virus.
[Yes, you did. How do these antivirals work? And do they have antiviral concoctions for other viral infections as well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsm9h5?context=5)|They target different pathways in the cell necessary for viral replication and production. By using mixtures of these agents you avoid the problem of a single mutation in one pathway getting around the drug, because there is a backup inhibitor in another pathway. This is why we call HIV drug-regimens ""cocktails."" Cocktails are finding their way into treating other viral infections as well. My guess is that just like mixed chemotherapies for cancer, we will soon be using cocktails for all chronic viral infections.
[How do they know which strains will be most prevalent each year? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgszpib?context=5)|I thought I answered this...but it did not seem to get posted. In essence we keep a close eye on strains emergency from countries like China. As it becomes more clear which ones will move around the world, decisions concerning which strains to use in the next vaccine are made. Often we get it right...sometimes we don't. That is why we need a universal flu vaccine.
[One last question regarding this an I'll be done. With the flu vaccine we give people flu viruses I'm assuming to try and boost the immune system to be able to fight it. Why can't something similar work with other viruses like HIV? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsn2tw?context=5)|It would likely work against that one strain. However there are so many strains of HIV out there all at once that the one you encountered probably wouldn't be the one vaccinated against. In contrast the annual flu strains are more limited and therefore vaccine will protect against this year's strains.
 |As an aside, trying to convince the FDA to immunize people with dead HIV took a long time.
 |If you could make a cocktail of ALL possible HIV strains on the planet, kill them thoroughly, and use that as a vaccine, it could work. Theoretically. The holy grail in this field is to find a molecule that is shared by ALL strains of HIV so that one vaccine would protect against all of them.
 |Finally, if you ask 100 immunologists this question, many would argue that you need something called ""T-cell immunity"" and that no combination of dead viruses will ever do the job.
[I was in the Navy and I got my smallpox vaccine around early 2008. Is it really good for 10 years, and is it worth getting it again in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsk9vd?context=5)|Smallpox vaccinations can last a lifetime and often do. The smallpox vaccine isn't used anymore in the American population... however the military still uses the vaccine because of the chance of smallpox being weaponized. So if you're out of the Navy I wouldn't worry about it, but if you are still in and it is offered, I would get it (not that you'd have a choice) because it will boost your protection.
[I'm out now. I've had way too many vaccines already. I still think the TB shot is the worst. Even compared to the burning Anthrax vaccines.  What is the most painful vaccine in your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgslbrx?context=5)|Anything that goes into your muscle with a needle is more painful. It can cause inflammation in the muscle which can last up to two days. That said, sometimes your immune system causes fever, malaise, and aches, and that isn't much fun either. The good news is your immune system is working!
[Where did you go to undergrad at? Favorite fruit? What did you want to grow up to be, when you were 10?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsm0ea?context=5)|I graduated from Connecticut College. My favorite fruit is Rock Hudson. A scientist or vet.
[In your opinion, besides the ones already almost wiped out like polio, what is the next disease that will become totally cured like smallpox?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsnp2a?context=5)|Thank you I will convey your kind words to the study-section reading my grants! Indeed, transdermal or intradermal vaccinations are extremely effective. It is my hope that someday all vaccinations will be given this way. Conversion from needles to patches is a slow process (and some people/agencies are resistant to change).
[Years ago I remember reading about ""patches"" where the vaccine is absorbed slowly through the skin. If such a thing exists, why are we still using needles? Or is it simply impossible to administer certain vaccines and meds except directly into the bloodstream?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsnp2a?context=5)|It's possible that the approved HPV vaccine or some modified form of it will wipe out cervical cancer.
[BTW I find your work inspiring. You and all your colleagues are the true heroes of modern humans. Keep it up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsnp2a?context=5)|Personally, I'd like to see hepatitis and herpes wiped out, and this should be possible with vaccines, if we can get the money to develop them. In the future it would be nice to identify and vaccinate against all cancer-causing viruses or pathogens that lead to chronic infections. Such chronic infections could cause seemingly unrelated diseases later in life such as autoimmunity and (maybe) Alzheimer's.
[Hi, I'm 15 and still unsure of what I'd like to do after school, but creating vaccines is something that has always interested me. What made you want to develop vaccines? What subjects should I study in school that would help me to pursue such a career? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsp404?context=5)|Hi Clara! Vaccines are exciting because they prevent diseases, which is much better than having to get sick and then try to cure being sick. To me, as an immunologist, this is a great thing to study because it has immediate benefits for the Human Race. It also combines my interests in medicine and basic science!
 |As far as your future is concerned, take whatever courses fascinate you and develop your brain. Obviously you'll want to take a variety of science and math courses, but don't let that become your whole life. The key is to study hard, do as well as you can, be enthusiastic, and go well beyond the minimum requirements. Try to interact with your teachers, read lots, and stay healthy. Good luck!
[I stepped on a nail this morning, what do I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsjg1w?context=5)|Wash it well, and make sure you've had a tetanus shot in in the last 10 years. Oh yes, and pull the nail out of your foot.
[How would a vaccine for a Biosafety level 4 pathogen go through human trials?  I don't know a lot about vaccines or whatever, but would that just not happen?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgskg5v?context=5)|The FDA requires safety testing of the vaccine in humans, and efficacy testing in 2 species prior to approval. It is not necessary for one of those species to be human for the challenge tests when it comes to the types of pathogens and toxins you are talking about.
[Thanks or the reply...it's not the short term effects but the long term effects that concern me. For instance, taking a vaccine year after year will build up these toxins in your body. And then years later neurological problems appear with no ""explanation"". ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsl5oq?context=5)|This is of course, possible. Nothing is 100% risk free, but rather a series of trade-offs in which we evaluate what we know and what we don't know. However, again, I believe preventing a serious disease (which itself has long-term consequences) trumps the possibility of a side-effect 40 years downstream. If and when we prevent all infectious disease by vaccination and people live to be 120, there will likely be some long term effects from additives, vaccines themselves, and so on. But the fact is we live longer WITH vaccines, than without them.
[Do you have any advice for an college senior (graduating in a month\) who is hoping to pursue research as a career path?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsptll?context=5)|Think twice. It's a hard slog, particularly in the current funding environment. In thinking ahead, try to pick something where you know there is a job at the other end in the event that the NIH money-tap doesn't turn back on. Some good fields are Biomedical Engineering, Bioinformatics, MD/PhD tracks, and environmental sciences.
[When she was your student, did you have any idea that Linda Buck would be as successful as she turned out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsptll?context=5)|No. The things that really distinguished Linda Buck from most of my students were her endless and often incessant questions (she followed me to the ladies room multiple times, but NOT to use it) and her incredible determination and stamina.
[Thanks! (from a fellow NESCAC undergrad\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/231pia/hi_reddit_im_dr_ellen_vitetta_biomedical/cgsptll?context=5)|All my students are very smart. But this is not enough. It takes hard work, determination, curiosity, the ability to deal with failure, and laser-like focus. PLUS a lot of luck. Linda had/has all these things. Therefore it is hard to predict who will capture the brass ring. I hope you're enjoying the beautiful spring weather in NE.

[Haven't you thought about coming back to the UK? I know that female-to-male transsexuals can have prosthetic, functional penises made from their existing skin (with a pump inside\) and you might be able to get one on the NHS. It's pretty shocking that the docs over there have left you with nothing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13huic/i_have_penectomy_last_year_and_my_penis_testes/c74kx6u?context=5)|Have thought about that,  but I am not an UK citizen and so I cannot enjoy the service of NHS.

What would you like people to know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13huic/i_have_penectomy_last_year_and_my_penis_testes/c74ina8?context=5)|I am not on any hormonal therapy at this moment as that is too expensive for me.  For the urethra, the doctors cut the urethra short and made a new opening, but the bladder muscle for controling the urine flow is still retained.  Nevertheless, it took me a few months through exercise and practice to take control the new urination opening.  Now I have to sit or squat to piss, and the piss will wet my ass and I have to clean up after piss, just as a woman.
[A lot of people are being rather insensitive here. I'm sorry you have to deal with those kinds of comments. Nevertheless, you are more of a man than most guys I know. A man's character is tested when he's subjected to a hardship, and you seem to be handling this amazingly well. My heart goes out to you, man.  Have you considered moving to another country, where people might be more accepting, and/or you could afford hormones therapy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/13huic/i_have_penectomy_last_year_and_my_penis_testes/c7479ly?context=5)|I do not think I would move to another country.

And in any event it is not a real one and is no compensation to a real one.
[Have you considered re-aligning your gender to a more feminine identity?  I mean, if you're not going to feel male any more, you might as well get to be one of the few humans who understands what it is to feel both male and female in one life.  Or at least...

I had no other symptoms before I found the small lump near the base of my penis.

finding a lgbt friendly Primary Care Physician,2,1rlqqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1rlqqr/finding_a_lgbt_friendly_primary_care_physician/,1,1385619353,"I am a 24 year old gay male and just got back from my doctors  office where I went in for an HIV screening, and STD counseling. I just had a horrible experience and want to know if others find it hard to find a lgbt friendly doctor and what their experiences have been. I have only been tested for HIV a few times and the last was about a year ago which was just an in-home oral swab so I thought I should go in for a more complete exam. I didn't want to go to planned parenthood or a clinic because it is very important to me to have a doctor that is well rounded in my medical state and history and that I should be able to talk to. I was a little nervous going in but thought it shouldn't be to bad because people must go in for the same thing all the time. The first thing the doctor told me was that, ""the ideal patient has only one sexual partner."" I said, ""well I guess I am not the ideal patient."" I felt very belittled and offended. Then he told me he tells his patients that if they are worried about HIV that they should just donate blood because it is helping people and they will tell you if you are HIV positive. I was under the impression that they do not tell you, they just throw your blood out once it gets to their lab, maybe I am wrong. I told him that I am not allowed to donate blood because I am a gay man to which he had no answer. I then told him I wanted his opinion on getting the HPV vaccine gardisol. I have been doing research and their is a rise in throat, penial, and anal cancer (especially in gay men) due to HPV. He told me if I have had a lot of partners then I probably already have it but would give it to me if I wanted  it, but gave me no advice. (The FDA currently recommends this for anyone under the age of 26, but especially females due to the increased risk of cervical cancer). So his nurse gave me a shot of gardisol, I have taken numerous shots in my life and always been fine. However, about 10 seconds after the shot I got very dizzy, blurred vision, started sweating profusely and throwing up. The nurse told me this happens to patients who have a high anxiety of doctors and shots, this is not me at all. I think the doctor's demeaning behavior induced my anxiety, but I am not going to say that definitively. I left without getting my bloodwork done for the HIV test. 

I will now be looking for another doctor but am still very apprehensive. It is hard to find lgbt doctors in my city because there are not many of them and a lot of them have waiting lists. Do you have any advice other than just going to the next one covered by my insurance and trying them out? This is the third doctor I have been to since moving here and they have all been subpar.  "
Possible types of HPV after having the Gardasil vaccine?,1,ysoug,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/ysoug/possible_types_of_hpv_after_having_the_gardasil/,4,1345904264,"Ladies and gentlemen! I'm a bisexual, mostly safe, 24-year-old female. To my utter terror, I recently got back an abnormal pap smear suggesting HPV infection. This is doubly shocking because I got the Gardasil vaccine back when I was a virgin. I have no noticeable symptoms in or out (and nor have any past sexual partners), but I do have a family history of cervical cancer leading to hysterectomies. 

I am very concerned and trying to understand more about my risks. However, after researching a while, I can only find the usual statistics: Gardasil, the coolest thing ever, protects against 75% of warty strains and 90% of cancery strains. However, I can find no statistics of how reliable the vaccine is at leading to actual, full prevention of those strains. I'm also interested in finding the relative prevalence of different HPV strains and their risk factors, whether they are prevented by Gardasil or not. Most importantly, though, I've been looking for any tests I could undergo (besides a colposcopy for which I'm already scheduled) that could help me determine what strain(s) I actually have, so that I could either alleviate my fears or get on the right track for any other precautions I can take.

Please help if you have any information, and thank you so much in advance!!"
Huge Decline in Teen Pregnancies - MTV or HPV Jab?,0,228m5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiro/comments/228m5k/huge_decline_in_teen_pregnancies_mtv_or_hpv_jab/,0,1396689069,"poster: **[lucycohen](/u/lucycohen)**, [original conspiracy link](/r/conspiracy/comments/228kn1/huge_decline_in_teen_pregnancies_mtv_or_hpv_jab/)

-----------------------------------

This article here tries to link an MTV show which started in 2009 with the decline in teen pregnancies which started in 2008

http://www.npr.org/2014/01/13/262175399/is-16-and-pregnant-an-effective-form-of-birth-control

Hmmm, let's be more realistic, how about the HPV jab which warns on it's insert that it can harm fertility, the program started right at the end of 2006 and by late 2007 about one quarter of US females age 13â€“17 years had received at least one of the three HPV shots.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV_vaccines#Vaccination_and_public_health

So, is it MTV or HPV Jabs?  Well, studies are already coming out showing that the HPV jab has left many girls infertile and sent many others into early Menopause.

A favorite line of the Reddit Pro-Vaccine Squad is ""Anti-vaxxer's will leave the gene pool, this is Darwinism at work"" yet what we're seeing now is that it's the Pro-Vaxxer's leaving the gene pool, while the educated anti-vaxxer's are sticking around.

As most of you know, the Elite/Banker's have inscribed on the Georgia Guidestones to ""Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetual balance with nature.""  So those 500 million remaining are going to be mainly descended from the anti-vaxxer's who kept their fertility intact.  Will this be seen as a problem?  Not necessarily, as the Georgia Guidestones also recommend to ""Guide reproduction wisely"" i.e. you have to have brains to stay in the genepool, the dumb will fall for the propaganda and get themselves sterilized.  

This is all a challenge, they are guiding reproduction, they are separating the wheat from the chaff, that is why vaccine exemptions still exist.

Today I found out I have genital warts. Is this the end of my sex life as I know it? (long post),0,w98x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/w98x2/today_i_found_out_i_have_genital_warts_is_this/,2,1341839230,"About a month ago I (22M) had protected sex with a girl (24) and nonetheless got the Human Papillomavirus (HPV) type that causes genital warts. 

This type, from what I understand, is a low-risk variety that is not associated with any health problems other than causing warts. However, even if the warts are removed and they don't come back, the virus is still there. Although it is true that it may be 'cleared up' by the immune system after two years or so, this doesn't happen in every case and experts don't seem to agree about whether it is completely deactivated or not. There are currently no tests for males to know whether you are still contagious or not. 

In my view, these are the implications:

- Since the virus can be transmitted by skin-to-skin contact and using a condom only reduces the chances of transmission but doesn't eliminate them, I have to inform all my future partners about this issue, even if I haven't had any warts for years.

- The best part about this is that 1 in 2 men may have contracted one or more types of HPV, and some of them cause cervical cancer in women or other kinds of cancer in both women and men. Luckily, the type I have contracted only causes warts.

- It is true that there is a vaccine, but it doesn't protect from every type of HPV and most people don't know anything about it and don't have it. 

- **Therefore, we live in a world in which everytime you have protected sex with a different person you play a game of Russian roulette with bullets made out of cancer**. Nobody told me this at school and nobody seems to be aware of it.

I was the unlucky one who got a visible type of HPV and therefore know that I have it. Most men don't have the moral obligation to tell their partners because there is no way for them to know if they have it.

I feel that I have to choose between being a decent person and inform every girl I have sex with for the rest of my life about this, severely limiting my chances of getting laid (who would be willing to take the risk?), or being a potential wart-giving asshole. In sum, I feel like shit, and it doesn't help that it wasn't really my fault that I got it.

I would appreciate any advice about how to cope with this or any personal stories. I would also like to know how female redditors would react to a person who tells them about this. Please be honest and imagine that you barely know that person. Finally, if you were in this situation, would you tell your sexual partners? Why/Why not? And how? 

If I got anything wrong about HPV, feel free to point it out. Thanks for reading. "
LPT: How to prevent cancer of the genitals,0,lt6p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/lt6p1/lpt_how_to_prevent_cancer_of_the_genitals/,3,1319923912,"**#1** If you are a uncircumcised Male make sure to pull back the foreskin and clean that groove that forms at the union of glans penis with the body of the penis everyday when you take a shower.

**#2** Both for Males / Females , avoid Promiscuity. HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) is the leading cause of cancer of cervix in females and penis in (of-course) males. The greatest risk of getting HPV is having multiple sexual partners over a short course of time. So avoiding promiscuity is the single best way to avoid getting HPV. You could also use condoms but they are not 100 % full proof against STDs. Safe sexual practice is the only reliable way to avoid STDs

**#3** Females could consider getting the HPV vaccine preferably before the age of 18 years.

**#4** Quit smoking. Smoking (Who Guessed ?) is linked to increase rates of cancer of the genitals in both men and women

**#5** Eating healthy, regular exercise and a healthy lifestyle overall go a long way in preventing cancer of the genitals and improving your overall health. 

**#6** Good Medical History and Regular Screening - If you have a history of cancer in your close relatives make sure that you have a detailed history taken as some people could be more prone to developing cancer. Pap smear for females and for men if you notice anything unusual (a new spot , non-healing ulcer) go see a doc immediately.

**#7** Be Happy - Being happy promotes general wellbeing which could prevent cancer. Says Who ? Well I do :)"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[I contracted HIV a little more than a month ago. I have no money for medicine, and I can't imaging having to tell my parents. I'm not even done with high school yet, and I'm at the point of why bother even trying? My question for you is how did you overcome/cope with the suicidal thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79v6v1?context=5)|First off, PM me if you'd like my number/kik messenger. I take messages like this very seriously so if you ever need to talk or text or whatever. I want you to know you've got someone wiling to listen.
 |As for your parents, even though it will be difficult, you really need to tell them. Because even if you're parents don't have health insurance, there are MANY government programs that will help you with medication. If you're from the United States or any ""1st world"" (I hate that term so much, but that's a battle for another day) you'll get your medicine some way. And even if you're in a poorer country, there are charities that help as well.
 |But all that starts with talking to your parents. It will be a difficult conversation, I won't lie about it to you, but it's important that you tell them. Thank about if from their perspective. If you had a child with a serious, life-threatening illness, wouldn't you want to know? They love you, and nothing, especially an illness, should make them stop. Be honest, and let them know that you're scared but you need and want their help.
 |As for the suicidal thoughts, I know it sound cliche, but you have to start talking to someone. Even if it's a teacher, and adult you trust, or a friend, talk to someone. Let them know exactly how you're feeling, and what's going through your head. Because keeping it inside will only hurt you in the end. If you ever feel like things are getting overwhelming or out of controll, I want you to google ""sucide"" IMMEDIATELY. Just do it and call the number that pops up. Also The Trevor Project is a good choice as well. There are even a number of places that let you IM. Please do this if it gets to that point. I'm so happy I called the Trevor project when I was holding that bottle of sleeping pills. I truly am thankful I did not take my life.
[My uncle passed away Thursday night due to AIDS-related causes. This is really blunt, but are you scared about getting AIDS? Like, how do you cope?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79vwet?context=5)|First, I'm so sorry to hear about your Uncle. I send you and your family my deepest condolences.
 |And yes, I'm scared. Due to insurance/life related issues, I was off my meds for over a week. Which could be a severe blow to maintaining my rapid strain. My doctor was up front with me though. I more than likely won't live past 40.
 |It's disheartening, yes, I mean my lifespan has been essentially cut in half. But on the flip side, I am no longer trying to waste time and energy with things I don't really want to do, since I quite literally don't have time. I'm currently in school for something I love, I'm planning to study abroad, I am studying four different languages (Spanish, German, Dutch,  & Swedish). I look at it this way. Without HIV, I wouldn't be pushing myself to truly do all I can. If that means I die of AIDS, then I guess it's something I'll just have to come to terms with.
[*And I'm staying positive.*  Am I a complete asshole for laughing a little?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c7atht3?context=5)|Nah, I made the same joke in another reply. I try to stay humorous about it. Or else it'd just make me sad lol.
[Well, we all want to know. What's your sex life like now? Do you still sleep around, or do you keep it responsible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79q9fl?context=5)|Haha, I was waiting for the question. My sex life is pretty awesome. Me and my partner are very compatible, and since I pretty much exclusively bottom, it makes the whole fluids thing a bit easier. It was hard for him to switch to condoms, but since HIV isn't transmitted through saliva, I make it up to him in blowjobs.
[Was he worried he could still get it even by using condoms?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79zk03?context=5)|Never. He never once expressed fear or worry about being with me. Because of my diagnosis, I NEVER top him. One because he's pretty much a power top, but two because I'm terrified of passing it to him. I can count on one hand how often I've been the top.
[What did you say to the doctor immediately after he told you? What were the next 24 hours after being told you were HIV+ like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79qvkt?context=5)|Oh my. This is a interesting question. I clearly rememeber the whole thing. I was speechless for pretty much the entire thing, I just kept nodding and giving one word answers. Eventually I just told her I needed to go, and we scheduled a follow up appointment. I happened to go for somehting unrelated so as such, my roommate and another dormmate were with me and asked if I was ok once we got outside. I just looked straight ahead and said ""I'm HIV positive."" My roommate kinda looked stunned as was like ""Seriously?"" and I screamed at him about if I looked serious and fell into the snow crying and kinda stayed there for a good while crying my eyes out.  I won't go into detail because it was a pretty dark period. But for the next few weeks after I struggled with committing suicide and telling my partner, etc. Eventually though I pulled out of that.
[Do your parents know? If so, what did they say?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79q0ve?context=5)|1) WE ARE NOT LEPERS! I've had ALOT of people assume they can contract the illness by being in close proximity to me. This is in fact false. Unless I (excuse my blutness) bleed or cum directly into an open wound, your mouth, or any other open area, trust me you'll be fine. 
[Do you have a SO? Does she/he know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79q0ve?context=5)|I do, although that's a sensitive subject. He does know however, and he is in fact HIV negative.
[What are some common stereotypes about HIV positive people that you would like to clarify? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79q0ve?context=5)|Oh god, this could be a thread on it's own. But I'll cover some quick ones:   2) Alot of advancement has been made in HIV medications. Where as only a few years ago I would be taking 6 or 7 pills throughout the day. I've been lucky enough to be on the two one-a-day pills that are out at the moment .  3) is the most important. HIV/AIDS still exist. Because there are not people dying in droves like in the 1980s (A sad moment in history that was very poorly handled by the United States) alot of American's seem to think HIV/AIDS still isn't an important issue. It really is. And the saddest part is because the diseases isn't as prevalent an issue as Breast Cancer or the like, people feel like they don't nee d to be tested, gay or straight. THIS IS FALSE! If you are sexually active, you should have a full STD/STI test every three months. Period. No if ands or butts.
[Its really not that important of an issue for most americans. HIV almost exclusively effects gay men and blacks which aren't a huge part of the population. Also its not really killing that many people when compared to alot of other major diseases ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c7a2rjy?context=5)|Its easy to think that when you don't have it lol. The rate of infection only started to go down with the recent generation of teenagers and early 20s demographic. It's still a very real disease. It people like yourself who think of it as a gay or black disease that cause it to continue to spread 
[ its spreading because people like you are not using condoms during anal sex. not because of what i think of the disease.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c7a7fhv?context=5)| 
[If I may ask (and hopefully not come across as insensitive. I'm just curious\), any idea how you got it? And how did you feel when you were told? How does the medication improve your day to day life? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79pxd9?context=5)|I think I'll answer this in a list :P.
 |Well I'll keep it 100% honest up in here. I'm pretty much solely a bottom.  (For those who don't know what that means, I prefer to be the receptive partner in anal intercourse) There's a good chance that I had sex with someone HIV+ without even knowing it. And since I was bad about using condoms, there's no way to know for sure who gave it to me.
 |I was told in a pretty messed up way actually. A guy I hooked up with once told me to get tested, so I did at the school health center. A few days later (mind you, I had no idea my results had come in yet) I got pink eye and went in to be seen. The doctor who had been giving me all the info on HIV and what it would mean came in instead of a nurse and I kinda put two and two together. But she told me my test came back positive.
 |It did significantly. Prior to finding out, I had been getting sick on the consistent basis, having vision issues, and was contracting illness I'd never had. Two bouts of pink eye (first ever btw), a case of the flu in the middle of September (a mild month in my state), etc. After about six months on the meds, most of that went away. I just had to deal with medication side effects.
[Well, it sucks that you contracted it, but at least the guy gave you a heads up, whether he knew before or not. Also, it's good to hear that the meds help you, as I understand the knock to the immune system can be utterly debilitating.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79q9x3?context=5)|The side effects. ARE. A. BITCH.
[Thank you for the answers. It's good to have someone to answer questions about this. 1st hand experience is more effective than ads on tv or something similar. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79q9x3?context=5)|But thanks for the kind words. I was really nervous about doing something like this, but I'm happy everyone's really into it.
[What are the side effects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79qrpu?context=5)|When I first started Atripla, the main thing that lead to me even having to leave school temporarily was the exhaustion. It would be around 2pm and I would be so drained I would pass out in the hallway on my way to my dorm. Even if I tried, once I started to feel tired, I had to sleep, or else I'd fall asleep in dangerous situations. And the nausea. I had to take it at night, on an empty stomach. But mind you I'm a college student. All nighters were a common occurrence to me. So what would happen is I would take my medication late at night and the next day would wake up feeling so queezy I couldn't eat for half the day. Then I'd eat a full meal, meaning I took my meds on a full stomach, meaning my side effects were worse.  Luckily I'm on a new one-a-day pill and the side effects are alot milder. And the more your body gets used to any medication, the more the side effects start to wear off.
[Can't you be prescribed an anti-nausea medication and adderall or Provigil?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79xlcx?context=5)|I could, but I hate meds in general now. Because the medication I'm on has a combination of three different drugs, I have to be very carefull about drug combinations. For example, most herbal remedies could cause a horrible drug reaction and put me in the hospital.
 |And I'm in college as an Architecture major. If you think I'm not chugging down adderall during finals week right now, you're crazy.
[*The drug retails in the United States for US$1,850 for a one-month supply.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79t9k7?context=5)|Hahahahaha is that what it says? Try $3,200 from Walgreens, $2,600 from CVS, and about $1,800 through Express Scripts mail order. Luckily my mom has excellent insurance. But this is part of the issue with HIV/AIDS. I've heard multiple individuals talk about how we should just spread around medication to harder hit areas, and in theory it would work. However alot of people don't know exactly how expensive pharmaceutical companies make the medications, creating complications in widespread distribution. It also doesn't help that one company has a monopoly on the most effective medications, Gilead.
[Oh god  I'm sorry about that.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79t9k7?context=5)| 
[Umm, I don't think you need Adderall to study architecture. Maybe mathematics or economics, but not architecture.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c7a4eyj?context=5)|Have you ever met an arch student? The latest study done on students who study the most had pre law, pre med, architecture, and engineering  as the top. About 50-60 hours a week.
[Do you hate the person who gave it to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79px3j?context=5)|I did for awhile, and I think to an extent I still do. But looking back, there's a good chance even he didn't know. And since I don't know exactly who it is, it's hard to hate someone when you don't know their name for sure.
[Do they make Christmas cards for people with HIV?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79vztg?context=5)|That's a good question, I'm not sure. I bet if they did it'd have some cheesy line like ""Have a Positively Merry Christmas"" or ""Merry Chris+mas"" or some shit like that lol.
[You should get a marketing job with Hallmark.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c7a4wpq?context=5)|I'm kinda vulgar. I'm sure I'd get fired in a week.  I'd make a sick joke like having a superman symbol in a baby carriage on the front with the words ""Congratulations! It's super aids!""
[Thanks for doing this AMA--very, very informative.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c7a4wpq?context=5)|I'm really really horribly non pc sometimes. 
[What caused you to get tested, did you have any symptoms that gave you the idea something was wrong? How do you find new people to date who won't freak when they find out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79q6i2?context=5)|I found out a person I had sex with a few months prior had just tested positive, and he told me to get tested as well.
 |That second question is a tuffy. I haven't dated since I found out, since I've been with the same person for awhile now, but I am scared of the prospect of dating again. I've heard from many MANY close friends that should someone they're interested in say they're HIV+, they wouldn't date them. And that's very disheartening.
[I'd imagine there's a group of HIV+ dating groups/sites?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c7a2jj3?context=5)|Suprisingly there are very few. 
[Thank you for sharing this. I know how my drunken antics have gotten me into different but also dangerous and unfortunate situations. Hearing your story just further reinforces how I should live my life to the fullest despite the bumps in the road that slow me down. I really hope you live as happy and healthy as you can be. I do however have a question. What do you want to do after you're done school? Do you have a bucket-list? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79z49w?context=5)|Thanks for asking! And stay strong!
 |As for what I want to do after school, I want to hopefully get an internship/apprenticeship with a firm in the Netherlands that works on creative housing developments tackling their housing problems. Then I want to work for either Gap Inc, Forever 21, Top Shop, or H&M as a store designer, creating retail spaces for them around the globe. But between working as a store designer and become a licensed Architect, I want to join the PeaceCorps and do something really meaningful for the world.
 |I do in fact have a small bucket list.
 |Visit all 7 continents for at least a weeks period of time.
 |Get married, hopefully with a white penguin tail suit that has an 8 foot long penguin tail train.
 |Start my own Architecture firm and create a structure that stands the test of time.
 |Go to the Super Bowl.
 |Go to the World Cup.
 |Go to the Olympics.
 |Live a happy life, with a mid size townhome or condo, a couple kids, two or three big dogs, and a husband who loves and accepts me for the crazy, nerdy, femboyish guy I am.
[Thanks for sharing your story! How long has it been since you found out? What was your most recent T-Cell count? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79w003?context=5)|It has been about a year and half since I found out. My most recent count was in the 300 range. I just had a battery of tests a few weeks ago. My doctor is hopefully I'll hit close to 500. If I can maintain above 500, there's a chance of going med free for awhile.
[Why would you go without if you hit 500?  Wouldn't it keep you healthier and keep your T cell count from falling if you keep taking it?  I've never really been told about medicine for HIV before, so, sorry if this is a very noob question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79whnf?context=5)|It's ok it's a valid question. If my T cell count consistently stays above 500,then it is an indication that the virus is under control and I can be weened off medication. HIV meds are a serious shock to the system, hence why the side effects are so horrible, so being off them will actually help my immune system in a lot of ways.
[I had unprotected sex and got tested a week and a half after (that was roughly three months ago\). In a few days, I plan to get retested just to be certain. It was a really poor decision at the time and I was absolutely terrified before I got my initial results.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79wocb?context=5)|First, I'm happy you're getting retested. It's very important to be on the safe side. And since you were a top, I would not be as worried. It's alot harder (not impossible, just more difficult) to pass the virus to the insertive partner than the receptive (god I sound like my doctor lol)
[He was a bottom, I am a (bi\)top. The option for protection was more of my responsibility. That being said, he was way too cavalier about our interaction and even justified it by saying he dealt with mostly straight men. You're fucking kidding, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79wocb?context=5)|And ya, that guy you were with is an idiot. That's not a justification at all.
[I was wondering how that should work as a bottom. It's pretty hard from that angle to judge if someone else is wearing anything. Although you could certainly feel the difference. Hypothetically, how should that scenario play out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79wocb?context=5)|Sadly, at the time I started having sex I was not really fully informed on safe sex, especially when it comes to gay sex, and the dangers of not practicing it (Another downfall of our school health classes, but again, a battle for another day [Oh and having Jehovah Witness parent's doesn't help either, but again. Another battle])
[Also, thank you so much for doing this AMA. This is one of the most important posts I have seen in a long time! I wish you the best.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79wocb?context=5)|But now, yes I can tell you for sure you can feel the difference. And what I do is watch to make sure it's been put on. Not in a accusing way but just to be on the safe side. To kind of take the awkwardness out of it, I usually put it on myself Mr. Garrison style (if you're a south park fan, you'll get it)
[Him, but he does make a good point that we still don't know all that there is to know about HIV.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79vcuh?context=5)|I do have to admit though. I have considered another theory suggesting that HIV is similar to HPV or other viruses where it contributes to a further diseases, but isn't always the exact cause.
[Earlier you said your doctor said you'll only live until 40 (or so s/he thinks\).  Is this because of your particular, rapidly advancing strain?  Or is that a typical prognosis for all HIV positive... patients?  People?  I'm not sure what word I want.  Lastly, with what you know of the advances in HIV medication in the past few years (at the very least from several pills a day to one, though I'm sure you know more than that\), do you think by the time you're 40 or so that they'll have created more effective medication that will help you live longer and stay AIDS free?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79wlbz?context=5)|Yes, it'd due to the rapid progression of the strain I have. HIV is very difficult to control because over the years it's mutated so much. South park made a joke about it, but Super AIDS is actually real. It effectively means the staring you have has become very drug resistant, so the possibility of controlling it is next to zero.  And as far as advancements go, I do think/hope there will be close to a cure as I get older. The fact that a few countries have FINALLY started human trials is a very good indicator that a cure could be developed in the next 10-20 years. I seriously think I'll throw a party when it happens.
[I was doing reading today on human trials and stuff.  Apparently the FDA has approved an HIV prevention drug (so far as a 1 a day pill for partners of those that have HIV\).  Link to www.globalpost.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c7absin?context=5)|Yep yep! And a university in Canada has started new research on a vaccine for HIV as well (Not a cure but a step in the right direction of eliminating it for good)
[Thank you for doing this AMA.  At what point in your relationships did you tell your partners that you were HIV-positive?  I mean, this isn't exactly a second-date topic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79r0sc?context=5)|No prob! And actually by that point, we'd been dating for quite awhile. So I told him one day when we were laying in bed together. He was very understanding, and helped me along every step of the way.
[Have you ever tried to hock a loogie into someones mouth? You know, for science? #AcidSpit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79qech?context=5)|Hahahaha. Um no. Not really into the whole spit thing lol.
[How has your life changed since you got the positive test result?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79pw4c?context=5)|At first it was a huge change. I'll readitly admit, I slept around ALOT my last two years of high school and my freshman year of college. And at the time I was with my partner, who took the news pretty well. Alot of my friends though, turned on me, seeing as how since I slept around, a good number had been exposed (although honestly there's no way to know where it started). People who knew me for months were suddenly afraid to talk or touch me, and I became really depressed.
 |Over time though, I've come to terms with it somewhat, although the thing that still scares me is being alone. My dating pool is already small because I'm a pretty femmy guy. But now it's like ubersmall with the HIV thing thrown in the mix.
[*My dating pool is already small because I'm a pretty femmy guy.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1448r3/iama_hiv_positive_student_who_found_out_his/c79w4fu?context=5)|But yeah pretty much. Like I said before I'm pretty fem. I like ""girl"" clothes, love to shop, lady Gaga, etc. And even though there's a ton more to my personality (I.e. I'm a major geek. I built my first computer when I was nine) all most people see is the outside. And what they see (both gay and straight) alot of the time is a walking stereotype. I've been told by guys I've been with and those I haven't that I just feed the media machine and portray a bad image for gay people. So I'm a good fuck but that's about it in alot of guy's eyes.

--
_____  
Is r/atheism the bastion of rationality it thinks it is? Here's some counterweight to the polemics against medical circumcision we've seen recently.

First, let's start out with the patently bad arguments on both sides.

Patently bad arguments **in favor** of circumcision:

 * I'm cut and I don't remember it and don't mind it now. (Anecdotes are not data)
 * God commands it.
 * Women prefer it this way. (This would probably be equally likely for an intact person in an area with low circ. rates)
 * I want my son to look like me.

Patently bad arguments **against** circumcision:

 * It's unnatural. ([naturalistic fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy)) 
 * It's the same as female genital mutilation. (where the clitoris is removed)
 * It started as a religious tradition, therefore it's *inherently* bad. (Wrong and irrelevant from a medical point of view)


Those out of the way, let's look at some of the medical benefits of circumcision. 

There is **extremely strong** medical evidence that **circumcision reduces HIV transmission**; so much, in fact, that the randomized controlled trials in Africa were stopped early because it was so efficacious. (Long term follow-up [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22210632)).

There are several attacks to this result. (Note the trend of attacking the results you don't want.) First, people attempted to discredit the methods or call into question the validity of the studies. This is unconvincing; there were three separate RCTs and a plethora of observational data. The evidence is overwhelming. 

Second, people have argued that safe sex (eg - condom use, education) is more effective. This is not disputed; however, the studies' results were **with education on sex and condom use for all participants**. Additionally, this is akin to arguing that condoms shouldn't be used because abstinence-only education is 'more effective' in preventing HIV spread. Circumcision is cheap, permanent, and effective in preventing the spread of HIV, and the WHO [currently recommends](http://www.who.int/hiv/mediacentre/MCrecommendations_en.pdf) it as a tool to combat the AIDS epidemic in Africa. 

Finally, it's argued that this result can't be extrapolated to places where HIV is not endemic. Well, that very question was addressed in this [recent paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0008723), which concluded that circumcision was likely cost-saving (and life saving) when applied to *only HIV transmission* in the United States. The paper does not take complications of circumcision into account, though they're unlikely to change the result. 

**Also, this makes no mention of the other benefits, like [reduced HPV transmission](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3119044/), lower [assorted STD rates](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16581731), reduced [penile cancer rates](http://www.springerlink.com/content/t38q2m0679375653/), and potentially [reduced prostate cancer rates](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.26653/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false).**

The obvious rebuttal is that this makes no mention of the drawbacks of the procedure. A common argument is that 'we should cut off the breasts of women to prevent breast cancer'. This, too, is unconvincing. First, there are situations where mastectomy is medically indicated for prophylactic purposes. Second, the breasts have significant demonstrable positive health effects for newborns. Finally, the mastectomy procedure is much riskier than circumcision and requires a much longer recovery period. 

So what are the drawbacks? It's claimed that it has significant sexual effects, but there is [little medical evidence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_effects_of_circumcision) for that claim, with an equal amount of evidence for the contrary. Opponents cite figures like 'half the sensory nerves are lost,' but again, without evidence of **actual effects**, this is irrelevant. 

It's also claimed that there are significant psychological side effects, but again, [there is no medical evidence of long-term adverse effects](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10930942).

There is also the potential for complications from the surgery itself. These are generally considered extremely low (~0.2%) and most studies find that the short-term risk/benefit equation is fairly balanced considering the positive effects circumcision has on prevention of UTIs, phimosis, epididymitis, balanitis, etc. See, for example, [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1794670). Note that this analysis, and several others were done before the effects on HIV/HPV transmission were known.

Another common argument against circumcision is that it should be left up to the child to decide when he comes 'of age'. However, this has some fatal flaws. 

First, most of the protective benefit comes with sexual activity, so the procedure should be done by age 11 or so (as with the HPV vaccine). Children that age are not capable of giving informed consent. 

Second, it's [much more costly](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469634) to circumcise post-neonatal infants. Ten times, in fact.

Third, childhood amnesia prevents the memory of the procedure's pain for neonates. This is not the case in children or adults, who will most likely carry painful memories through the rest of their lives. 

An apt comparison can be drawn with vaccination. In fact, circumcision could be called a 'physical vaccine.' All vaccines come with risks and benefits, including initial pain with administration, severe complications, and even death. There is a 'tipping point' for any vaccine that makes it 'worth it'. There is mounting evidence that *routine medical infant circumcision* has more positives than negatives. **It has undeniably saved thousands of lives**.

Anti-circumcision activists may also point out that the AAP's policy (along with several other countries medical associations) is that there is no medical reason for circumcision. I would like to point out that this policy was enacted in 1999, well before this new data on HIV, HSV, and prostate cancer risk was available. 

Even if you're unconvinced that circumcision is a 'good thing', you must admit that there is a tipping point where you'd support its routine administration. If not, you're guilty of ignoring evidence and clinging to dogma. Who do we know does that?
